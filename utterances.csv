35185,PS4,3,4.64,8.48,3.84,1.0,Is it an equal distribution of academic resources to dismounted and marginalized groups?
35185,PS4,3,42.64,43.96,1.32,1.0,What do you what do you think?
35185,PS4,3,47.8,57.56,9.76,1.0,"I think it's good to like for this one to go on like how you were like inspired to study your topic to begin with, like what means."
35185,PS4,3,66.28,70.12,3.84,2.0,This pretty tough because I think the world leaders haven't found a problem.
35185,PS4,3,70.12,71.76,1.64,2.0,I haven't found a solution for this yet.
35185,PS4,3,71.76,76.8,5.04,2.0,Right to A to a like a good extent.
35185,PS4,3,82.71,86.51,3.8,1.0,"I mean, I mean, like, part of it is mainly something that happens at schools, right?"
35185,PS4,3,86.51,86.71,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35185,PS4,3,90.79,94.67,3.88,2.0,"I don't know that I'm from Singapore, right?"
35185,PS4,3,94.67,109.12,14.45,2.0,"So the thing about schools is that between different schools, there already be different resources allocated and how you get to these schools is dependent on your grade."
35185,PS4,3,109.12,117.72,8.6,2.0,"When you're in primary school, then you could argue that your grade when your primary school is dependent on how rich you are and your parents are sending more ritual classes."
35185,PS4,3,119.8,123.16,3.36,2.0,"So then I don't know, to me, that's for me to start as young as possible."
35185,PS4,3,125.92,135.92,10.0,2.0,"Just even if you allocate the same more resources to every school, the the the staff will always focus more attention on those that they believe will be the brightest."
35185,PS4,3,136.08,136.88,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35185,PS4,3,140.96,145.92,4.96,2.0,So I think Mantle would would be approached from a like a very young age to.
35185,PS4,3,151.33,165.12,13.79,1.0,"But yeah, this also comes from like from the beginning, like the perspective, like some parents don't think that education is like the most important thing that you could be spending your time on doing, whereas the other parents feel very strongly about this, right?"
35185,PS4,3,167.24,173.6,6.36,1.0,"So if like your parent doesn't care about whether you get homework done when you get back home from school, then that is obviously going to make a really big difference."
35185,PS4,3,176.36,187.16,10.8,1.0,"So maybe it's like giving one idea to be giving children like, space to focus on their academics, like after class."
35185,PS4,3,187.16,189.4,2.24,1.0,"But then again, that's not like the earliest stage, right?"
35185,PS4,3,189.4,193.96,4.56,1.0,"Like that would be maybe for a high school student, not necessarily for someone who's in primary school."
35185,PS4,3,194.0,194.12,0.12,2.0,Right.
35185,PS4,3,194.12,196.16,2.04,2.0,"But I mean, it doesn't have to be the earliest stage."
35185,PS4,3,196.4,196.68,0.28,2.0,It's just.
35185,PS4,3,197.16,197.28,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35185,PS4,3,235.88,243.24,7.36,3.0,I'm just thinking about how health inequality also affect people and how to go about it.
35185,PS4,3,243.56,253.2,9.64,3.0,And why would you tackle health inequality mostly is one way is the use of artificial intelligence?
35185,PS4,3,254.0,254.92,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, like."
35185,PS4,3,255.8,274.4,18.6,3.0,"As long as we know their disadvantage and marginalized and sometimes maybe because of their socio economic status, but as long as there's an Internet connection, can build apps where they can sit at home and go with their phone and then easy to educate them, yeah."
35185,PS4,3,278.36,278.84,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
35185,PS4,3,280.0,288.56,8.56,1.0,Should we try to like do some like combination of both those things so.
35185,PS4,3,312.48,345.36,32.88,1.0,So this would be like having dedicated time for children to learn after class using our resources.
35185,PS4,3,353.68,357.24,3.56,1.0,I think develops for like maybe people who are like more marginalized.
35185,PS4,3,357.24,364.76,7.52,1.0,"So that could be like at the edges, I guess like I you always have to like stop from like the lowest command denominator, right?"
35185,PS4,3,365.44,370.0,4.56,1.0,"So I guess like, yeah."
35185,PS4,3,388.28,391.6,3.32,1.0,"OK, we actually have much time left."
35185,PS4,3,392.32,392.4,0.08,3.0,So.
35185,PS4,3,423.92,426.84,2.92,2.0,He just mentioned that the e-learning platform will be free.

35185,PS4,3,431.12,443.36,12.24,3.0,"And also I was thinking about disadvantaged groups, then we have to figure out in those that are disabled, that's most, most times they are disadvantaged."
35185,PS4,3,443.48,444.08,0.6,2.0,That's true.
35185,PS4,3,444.56,466.04,21.48,2.0,"So you want to e-learning platform where I mean for people who not very good hearing, they definitely can read out, but those who are blind, how you're going to have an e-learning platform that yeah, I guess, yeah, just having somethings that have a speaker that can read out and they're useful."
35185,PS4,3,469.56,472.6,3.04,3.0,They're constantly sent for people who are blind.
35185,PS4,3,473.36,474.68,1.32,2.0,There are four designed people who are blind.

35213,PS4,3,129.84,143.88,14.04,2.0,"So for now at the moment, the best graduate, it's going to the like consulting company because they give more like because Indonesia the education is also free, but the level of education is still different."
35213,PS4,3,143.88,150.92,7.04,2.0,"Like in the village even it's free because the leg of the number of the teacher, OK."
35213,PS4,3,152.76,156.04,3.28,1.0,"So are they more like private, tutored and public?"

35452,PS4,3,15.16,31.36,16.2,1.0,So basically put a cap maybe towards reserve a particular portion of the scholarships or bursaries for people that are in disadvantage and marginalised groups so that they will have access to opportunities and financial resources.
35452,PS4,3,32.36,32.48,0.12,1.0,Yeah.

35452,PS4,3,48.16,51.8,3.64,2.0,Maybe we should like promote like AI education.
35452,PS4,3,52.56,56.56,4.0,1.0,So that's for the the marginalised group or disadvantage groups.
35452,PS4,3,56.56,64.16,7.6,2.0,They can also get the equal opportunity to get education from the AI rather than from a teacher like this.
35452,PS4,3,64.16,69.2,5.04,2.0,"Teacher is a scars resource, especially in those rural areas, but AI is quite common."
35452,PS4,3,69.88,78.4,8.52,3.0,I agree with AI education especially for some students live in remote area and then they can also like get their education.
35452,PS4,3,78.96,88.6,9.64,2.0,"Yeah, at the same time, for those disadvantages group, they may not even have PC or they may not have access to the AIII."
35452,PS4,3,89.68,109.76,20.08,2.0,Think there's something like that digital divides is that current call that that because people are just people with low social economic status will have less access to access to the advanced technologies or not knowledge.
35452,PS4,3,161.15,161.95,0.8,1.0,Is this OK?

36387,PS5,3,1.92,9.48,7.56,1.0,Voluntary attrition happens when an employee disaster of the company resulting in reduction of value talent in the workforce.
36387,PS5,3,10.08,14.16,4.08,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to stop voluntary employee.
36387,PS5,3,14.16,16.76,2.6,2.0,Attrition so.
36387,PS5,3,19.76,23.48,3.72,1.0,"That's when you voluntary decide to basically fire yourself, yeah."

36387,PS5,3,33.56,34.76,1.2,2.0,Just to float an idea.
36387,PS5,3,34.76,39.08,4.32,2.0,"I mean, I guess the the key thing to maybe try to figure out is why do people generally resign?"
36387,PS5,3,39.24,39.44,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36387,PS5,3,41.08,43.36,2.28,1.0,"Yeah, maybe they're not satisfied."
36387,PS5,3,44.0,49.56,5.56,1.0,So if there was like some sort of program that does like routine.
36387,PS5,3,49.56,52.4,2.84,3.0,"They're not getting rewarded for effort, people."
36387,PS5,3,52.64,63.16,10.52,1.0,"To see how like employee employees are finding like how how they see how they are the company like something routinely done say every like 3 months or so, I don't know."
36387,PS5,3,64.52,69.36,4.84,1.0,So that way you kind of get an idea of where the employee stands on.
36387,PS5,3,69.96,78.48,8.52,1.0,"So they didn't just wake up 1 morning and just decide to quit because they could be like unsatisfied, but like no one knows."
36387,PS5,3,78.92,84.52,5.6,1.0,"Oh, because no one is like bothered to find out how to do not coping with like workload and that kind of thing."
36387,PS5,3,85.84,86.88,1.04,1.0,That's one solution.
36387,PS5,3,88.68,94.12,5.44,2.0,"So I guess what you're trying to say is there needs to be better monitoring of like employees, sort of."
36387,PS5,3,94.96,95.88,0.92,1.0,Satisfaction.
36387,PS5,3,95.88,96.04,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
36387,PS5,3,96.04,96.32,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36387,PS5,3,96.32,97.0,0.68,2.0,Well-being.
36387,PS5,3,98.48,105.64,7.16,2.0,"I guess the question for me is like, what prevents people from being able to do that?"
36387,PS5,3,106.56,108.92,2.36,1.0,From just waking up all morning and silent to quit.
36387,PS5,3,109.4,117.24,7.84,2.0,"Yeah, just just feeling unsatisfied and not feeling like you have the ability to communicate to your management that you're unhappy at what?"
36387,PS5,3,117.24,118.64,1.4,2.0,What would be the barriers to that?
36387,PS5,3,120.96,124.44,3.48,3.0,Maybe they are afraid of like possible replications after that.
36387,PS5,3,125.32,126.44,1.12,2.0,"OK, Yeah."
36387,PS5,3,126.68,142.42,15.74,3.0,Or creative idea to stop voluntary and proliferation?
36387,PS5,3,148.48,171.88,23.4,3.0,So there can be an anonymous channel where employees are asked to showcase their concerns about the job and the management could try to kind of accommodate their requirements.
36387,PS5,3,172.04,173.36,1.32,3.0,This is one thing.
36387,PS5,3,174.96,177.36,2.4,3.0,"Otherwise, write somebody by choice."
36387,PS5,3,180.84,181.68,0.84,1.0,"Yeah, that's true."
36387,PS5,3,184.04,184.36,0.32,2.0,OK.
36387,PS5,3,184.4,198.88,14.48,2.0,So anonymous platform that allows employees to communicate the grievances or constructive feedback and then having a management system that is very responsive.
36387,PS5,3,200.32,205.16,4.84,2.0,"So it's you said lack, lack of satisfaction, inability for people to communicate it."
36387,PS5,3,205.16,209.52,4.36,2.0,You were talking about like feeling like you're like undervalued in your role.
36387,PS5,3,209.52,217.88,8.36,2.0,"I think you said that like if it's unappreciated, I guess like salary reimbursement's another key thing like you become unhappy."
36387,PS5,3,218.56,220.36,1.8,1.0,Upper competitive like salaries.
36387,PS5,3,220.44,221.04,0.6,2.0,Yeah.
36387,PS5,3,222.04,226.64,4.6,1.0,Maybe they seem like company pays like much better than that type of thing.
36387,PS5,3,232.2,236.12,3.92,3.0,So what are some most prevalent reasons for resignations?
36387,PS5,3,236.8,238.44,1.64,3.0,1 is like salary.
36387,PS5,3,238.68,239.2,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, salary."
36387,PS5,3,239.56,241.8,2.24,3.0,You feel like you're not being rewarded properly.
36387,PS5,3,241.8,245.96,4.16,3.0,Second is work life balance I guess what else could be?
36387,PS5,3,250.16,250.72,0.56,1.0,Maybe like.
36387,PS5,3,251.36,254.48,3.12,3.0,"The work you are doing is not at par, or maybe it is."
36387,PS5,3,255.12,258.96,3.84,3.0,You're basically either over employed or underemployed sometimes.
36387,PS5,3,259.72,263.88,4.16,1.0,"Or the tasks are like mundane, they're quite repetitive and I'm closed."
36387,PS5,3,263.88,264.92,1.04,3.0,"But that's dating, yeah."
36387,PS5,3,265.88,267.28,1.4,2.0,"Used to me later, yeah."
36387,PS5,3,267.36,276.64,9.28,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, but like, you know, if you have a job where you didn't like pretty much the exact same thing every single day for like 5 days, that kind of gets boring."
36387,PS5,3,281.36,290.12,8.76,3.0,So can we leave it together like one approach with kind of try to address most of the concerns?
36387,PS5,3,293.72,297.72,4.0,2.0,Here's a here's a like a because it's quite a trying creative and outside.
36387,PS5,3,297.72,298.28,0.56,2.0,"Yeah, right."
36387,PS5,3,298.52,303.16,4.64,2.0,"What I'm thinking is, you know, like this is something that I'm taking from mental health."
36387,PS5,3,303.44,312.04,8.6,2.0,"But you know, when you're trying to track mood and changes in mood, you can get people at random times of the day to score their their emotions."
36387,PS5,3,312.84,326.28,13.44,2.0,"And maybe you could have some online platform, you could have some app in people's phones where throughout their day people can can write how good they or positive they feel about their job."
36387,PS5,3,326.8,327.56,0.76,3.0,And with time stamp and.
36387,PS5,3,327.72,336.92,9.2,2.0,"With a time stamp and like a task and then, you know, management could could see what parts of the day."
36387,PS5,3,338.6,340.68,2.08,2.0,"Yeah, it contribute to people's well-being."
36387,PS5,3,340.92,343.32,2.4,2.0,And are there ways to then facilitate that?
36387,PS5,3,343.8,350.52,6.72,2.0,So maybe it could be like an online app that people have where they can voluntarily sort of communicate their grievances.
36387,PS5,3,350.84,359.0,8.16,2.0,"Then also like at random points in the day, they did notifications and they just say like how how satisfied in your role do you feel?"
36387,PS5,3,359.0,360.92,1.92,2.0,One to 10 and they can score it.
36387,PS5,3,361.36,363.44,2.08,2.0,"And then if they want, they can give a reason for it."
36387,PS5,3,363.88,367.04,3.16,2.0,"It's a bit, it's a bit wacky, but I think it I think it's something to it."
36387,PS5,3,368.0,378.2,10.2,1.0,So what I've got super is anonymous platform that enables employees provide feedback on current working situations throughout the day to which management can monitor like responses and yeah.
36387,PS5,3,383.88,384.52,0.64,2.0,Should I just.
36387,PS5,3,384.92,385.2,0.28,2.0,Yeah.

36387,PS5,3,443.56,453.12,9.56,2.0,"OK, yeah, that makes they don't want to annoy people to give anonymous."
36387,PS5,3,460.36,473.76,13.4,2.0,"Feedback on current working situations, current areas of improvement."
36387,PS5,3,475.92,486.64,10.72,2.0,This app will also randomly prompt please.
36387,PS5,3,566.19,566.31,0.12,2.0,None.
36387,PS5,3,632.72,635.0,2.28,2.0,Hope you don't mind me just grabbing and just typing out.

34301,PS5,6,789.16,790.48,1.32,1.0,"You'd be like, I don't know."
34301,PS5,6,790.48,791.52,1.04,1.0,"For me, that's a big driver."
34301,PS5,6,792.32,797.24,4.92,5.0,So I think understand your employees and what drives them and then reward them accordingly.
34301,PS5,6,798.4,799.88,1.48,1.0,Reward them so it's reward.
34301,PS5,6,800.8,803.56,2.76,5.0,Understand like incentivized.
34301,PS5,6,803.56,806.84,3.28,5.0,"Yeah, like I, I, I might want recognition."
34301,PS5,6,807.08,808.44,1.36,5.0,He might want better pay.
34301,PS5,6,808.44,809.84,1.4,5.0,He might want remote working.
34301,PS5,6,810.08,811.72,1.64,5.0,You might just want to be happy at work.
34301,PS5,6,812.0,817.2,5.2,5.0,So like understand the employees and then tailor it accordingly.
34301,PS5,6,818.44,821.52,3.08,1.0,So in that way you would say investment.
34301,PS5,6,822.64,830.4,7.76,1.0,"How do you understand so, so tailor reward structures according to the values of the employees."
34301,PS5,6,830.4,835.72,5.32,1.0,So so Taylor employee benefits or.
34301,PS5,6,837.36,841.04,3.68,2.0,"No, CEO, that's what we're trying."
34301,PS5,6,843.56,844.32,0.76,4.0,No C level.
34301,PS5,6,847.04,852.4,5.36,6.0,You can apply machine learning techniques to previous employee turnover data.
34301,PS5,6,853.28,854.12,0.84,4.0,To the key.
34301,PS5,6,854.12,854.84,0.72,4.0,I like that.
34301,PS5,6,855.32,855.4,0.08,6.0,I.
34301,PS5,6,855.96,856.56,0.6,4.0,Like that?
34301,PS5,6,857.36,857.72,0.36,6.0,"Yeah, I."
34301,PS5,6,858.2,858.68,0.48,4.0,Like that.
34301,PS5,6,861.12,862.12,1.0,4.0,And of course you can.
34301,PS5,6,862.32,867.16,4.84,4.0,You can use that to tailor benefits or the environment to them.
34301,PS5,6,868.88,872.32,3.44,4.0,And that is creative because it's more than just the exit interview thing.
34301,PS5,6,872.6,873.48,0.88,5.0,So why did you leave it?
34301,PS5,6,874.04,874.28,0.24,4.0,Clever.
34301,PS5,6,874.28,877.0,2.72,4.0,I'm looking for whatever.
34301,PS5,6,879.24,890.36,11.12,2.0,"One of the things that's been frustrating to me and different employers is like there's, there's always like pay for performance and based on how the company's doing."
34301,PS5,6,891.12,891.56,0.44,4.0,But.
34301,PS5,6,893.0,901.4,8.4,2.0,I feel like employees generally don't actually see the profits that the company seems like the company can be doing.
34301,PS5,6,901.44,902.0,0.56,4.0,Very well.
34301,PS5,6,902.0,902.24,0.24,4.0,Oh yeah.
34301,PS5,6,902.32,903.64,1.32,4.0,Like disproportionate.
34301,PS5,6,905.16,905.32,0.16,4.0,Yeah.
34301,PS5,6,905.84,907.6,1.76,5.0,"It's a list that's somewhere, I think employees."
34301,PS5,6,910.48,915.64,5.16,2.0,"You know have equity, more equity in the company that's obviously that's already done in the places, but."
34301,PS5,6,918.0,919.24,1.24,4.0,"Yeah, I think so too that."
34301,PS5,6,919.28,921.8,2.52,2.0,Really that my shares and my company are worth something we're doing.
34301,PS5,6,929.34,938.74,9.4,6.0,"Instead of exit interviews, you can have stay interviews and interview the people that are still there and identify why they're still there and what their drivers are."
34301,PS5,6,938.74,943.3,4.56,6.0,And I guess that's kind of like the first point to hearing it tomorrow so that.
34301,PS5,6,944.58,949.18,4.6,5.0,Could be an example and and that is an example stay interviews.
34301,PS5,6,950.56,952.28,1.72,6.0,I'm sure there's a better word for it.
34301,PS5,6,953.24,954.4,1.16,6.0,"Sort of Exit yes, Don't."
34301,PS5,6,955.8,956.24,0.44,1.0,Follow.
34301,PS5,6,964.12,965.0,0.88,6.0,About free pizza.
34301,PS5,6,968.4,970.64,2.24,1.0,"Office canteen, Yes, that it generally is."
34301,PS5,6,970.64,972.44,1.8,4.0,Assisted by machine learning.
34301,PS5,6,984.36,985.2,0.84,6.0,"After four hours, that's all."
34301,PS5,6,985.24,985.64,0.4,4.0,I can think.
34301,PS5,6,986.44,986.6,0.16,1.0,About.
34301,PS5,6,988.6,989.44,0.84,4.0,Visualise that in.
34301,PS5,6,990.72,991.24,0.52,6.0,The graph.
34301,PS5,6,991.6,993.36,1.76,4.0,"Yeah, understand your audience."
34301,PS5,6,993.36,994.68,1.32,2.0,What colour would you use?
34301,PS5,6,997.12,998.52,1.4,6.0,Red toys that lack the curve.
34301,PS5,6,998.88,999.2,0.32,4.0,Red.
34301,PS5,6,999.2,1000.4,1.2,2.0,From the chain grey and red.
34301,PS5,6,1004.36,1007.24,2.88,1.0,I want to say evidence suggests that employees do not stay because of high salaries.
34301,PS5,6,1007.24,1007.96,0.72,1.0,So I hear what you say.
34301,PS5,6,1007.96,1013.2,5.24,1.0,If salaries are sort of matched to industry standards.
34301,PS5,6,1013.64,1014.88,1.24,1.0,So we do pay reviews.
34301,PS5,6,1015.28,1020.24,4.96,1.0,"So if, if you I'm not getting the best pay, I can definitely be paid elsewhere much better."
34301,PS5,6,1020.6,1026.24,5.64,1.0,But I enjoy my teams and I enjoy apart from the fact that they bonded me for my university.
34301,PS5,6,1026.48,1036.52,10.04,1.0,"But if they didn't do that, I enjoy my teams and they get freedom and I they also I have an amazing staff campaign so the work environment is quite nice and flexible."
34301,PS5,6,1036.52,1037.76,1.24,1.0,I can work from home when they don't want.
34301,PS5,6,1037.96,1044.24,6.28,1.0,"So would I go to a different employer that pays me 10 grand more, 20 grand more?"
34301,PS5,6,1044.8,1045.44,0.64,1.0,I wouldn't.
34301,PS5,6,1046.48,1049.24,2.76,2.0,"Well, and totally, like, you know, I work from home."
34301,PS5,6,1049.6,1052.48,2.88,2.0,"If I didn't work from home, I'd have to commute 45 minutes each way."
34301,PS5,6,1052.6,1059.44,6.84,2.0,At least that's it would take a lot of money to make me want to give that up.
34301,PS5,6,1059.64,1060.08,0.44,1.0,Give that up.
34301,PS5,6,1060.16,1060.56,0.4,1.0,Exactly.
34301,PS5,6,1060.92,1064.12,3.2,1.0,OK Any other ideas?
34301,PS5,6,1064.12,1071.0,6.88,1.0,"I think you've got a good answer, but so I think Taylor is a creative is a creative."
34301,PS5,6,1075.84,1082.36,6.52,1.0,I I haven't heard of any better models to increase retention of employees.
34301,PS5,6,1083.08,1085.08,2.0,5.0,You think you're going to use predictive analytics?
34301,PS5,6,1085.12,1085.36,0.24,1.0,Right.
34301,PS5,6,1085.8,1086.92,1.12,2.0,Here at the end of the year.
34301,PS5,6,1087.96,1090.44,2.48,4.0,You participate in the.
34301,PS5,6,1090.48,1091.96,1.48,1.0,"UK that would actually work, yeah."
34301,PS5,6,1093.8,1100.32,6.52,5.0,We could use like predictive analytics to see what will make them stay in the organization.
34301,PS5,6,1101.4,1103.16,1.76,1.0,"And the predictive analytics, yeah."
34301,PS5,6,1104.72,1106.56,1.84,6.0,"But if you won $1,000,000, would you still stay?"
34301,PS5,6,1107.48,1107.88,0.4,2.0,Would you?
34301,PS5,6,1107.88,1108.64,0.76,2.0,"Well, that's a good question."
34301,PS5,6,1108.64,1109.12,0.48,2.0,"It would, maybe."
34301,PS5,6,1109.16,1110.96,1.8,4.0,"Give you 1,000,000 to leave."
34301,PS5,6,1111.2,1112.96,1.76,2.0,You only lose one person.
34301,PS5,6,1113.28,1113.52,0.24,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34301,PS5,6,1114.76,1117.68,2.92,2.0,"And everyone else is like, I could win $1,000,000 this year."
34301,PS5,6,1117.84,1118.64,0.8,4.0,So I can say.
34301,PS5,6,1118.68,1120.32,1.64,6.0,"It's that it will be 1 per year, yeah."
34301,PS5,6,1124.0,1129.88,5.88,1.0,Are we doing too many on I can only do 1 So do you guys want to go with lottery because I don't think it'll work with possible.

34301,PS5,6,1132.6,1132.84,0.24,5.0,In the.

34301,PS5,6,1134.48,1138.92,4.44,1.0,"Creative, it is creative, and lottery does work here because people do have that sort."
34301,PS5,6,1139.72,1139.8,0.08,4.0,Of.
34301,PS5,6,1140.0,1147.8,7.8,1.0,"If you say that they are in a lottery to win a house, Can you imagine that amazing people would just stay for years and years and years, Don't you think?"
34301,PS5,6,1148.04,1148.36,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
34301,PS5,6,1148.88,1149.56,0.68,1.0,Should I do that?

34301,PS5,6,1414.32,1416.12,1.8,4.0,It creates obligations for some time.
34301,PS5,6,1416.24,1417.84,1.6,6.0,"It's not, yeah, it's not going to be huge."
34301,PS5,6,1420.64,1421.48,0.84,6.0,It's a good price.
34301,PS5,6,1423.72,1425.64,1.92,4.0,"And you have to insure the horse, of course."

34301,PS5,6,1434.04,1435.32,1.28,1.0,I'm just going to go to the next one.
34301,PS5,6,1435.52,1436.6,1.08,1.0,Prepare for the next question.
35303,PS5,3,2.24,4.04,1.8,1.0,When did the shit happens in a baby socks in the company?
35303,PS5,3,4.04,5.0,0.96,1.0,"OK, they're only gonna."
35303,PS5,3,6.08,6.36,0.28,2.0,Issue about.
35303,PS5,3,8.28,13.24,4.96,1.0,"2000 miles right, So it's a good resign right they used."
35303,PS5,3,13.36,13.44,0.08,2.0,To.
35303,PS5,3,13.92,14.88,0.96,1.0,Be signed for.
35303,PS5,3,14.88,15.6,0.72,3.0,The company voluntary.
35303,PS5,3,16.56,17.8,1.24,2.0,"Info OK, now my lawyer."
35303,PS5,3,17.8,19.28,1.48,3.0,Not their family members.
35303,PS5,3,19.28,20.44,1.16,2.0,I like this idea.
35303,PS5,3,22.24,23.2,0.96,3.0,This will definitely.
35303,PS5,3,23.2,23.44,0.24,2.0,Work.
35303,PS5,3,23.44,25.32,1.88,2.0,This will stop them from residing for sure.
35303,PS5,3,26.0,29.24,3.24,1.0,"But in OK, that's one very care."
35303,PS5,3,30.64,42.52,11.88,1.0,"But in, in what I'm experiencing is that some companies do offer benefits for employees that so that's kind of it's very interesting, but then it ties them up."
35303,PS5,3,43.44,44.12,0.68,2.0,For example.
35303,PS5,3,44.88,51.88,7.0,1.0,"Yeah, for example, they can offer you like a very low interest rate for loan."
35303,PS5,3,52.12,58.16,6.04,1.0,"Yeah, let's say they they loan you like £1,000,000 with only 1% of interest, right."
35303,PS5,3,58.28,68.0,9.72,1.0,"But then, but then you have to pay repay them and then you cannot exit the company unless you pay for the whole 1,000,000."
35303,PS5,3,68.0,74.12,6.12,1.0,"So if you if people took that benefit, then they'll have to stay there until."
35303,PS5,3,74.44,74.56,0.12,2.0,They.
35303,PS5,3,74.56,75.04,0.48,1.0,Repaid.
35303,PS5,3,75.08,75.56,0.48,3.0,Everything.
35303,PS5,3,75.68,77.0,1.32,3.0,Only if you take that benefit.
35303,PS5,3,77.2,77.52,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS5,3,77.56,80.24,2.68,1.0,"I mean, that's 111 of the one of the."
35303,PS5,3,81.2,81.48,0.28,2.0,I would.
35303,PS5,3,82.2,82.92,0.72,2.0,That's what you were saying.
35303,PS5,3,82.92,83.04,0.12,2.0,Well.
35303,PS5,3,83.16,87.92,4.76,1.0,"The solution for the company, like I want you to stay, I'll give you this, but then you have to be here."
35303,PS5,3,88.16,88.4,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35303,PS5,3,88.68,90.6,1.92,3.0,So basically making them sign a contract.
35303,PS5,3,90.6,95.56,4.96,1.0,"Yeah, making them sign a contract with a beneficial that cannot get it outside."
35303,PS5,3,95.84,96.68,0.84,2.0,"Yeah, I would agree."
35303,PS5,3,96.68,99.68,3.0,2.0,"I think positive, positive long term incentives."
35303,PS5,3,99.68,101.0,1.32,2.0,So 1 can be a loan.
35303,PS5,3,101.0,105.12,4.12,2.0,"Then you have employee stock options, which will only mature if you've been in a company for so long."
35303,PS5,3,105.12,105.44,0.32,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35303,PS5,3,106.0,106.84,0.84,1.0,"Yeah, that's, that's, that's."
35303,PS5,3,108.12,108.32,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
35303,PS5,3,108.32,113.16,4.84,3.0,But anything any it doesn't say reduce it says stop it completely.
35303,PS5,3,113.16,117.36,4.2,3.0,"I just think any positive benefit they could go Nah, I prioritize something else more."
35303,PS5,3,117.72,119.32,1.6,3.0,"But if it's a negative thing, if."
35303,PS5,3,119.32,119.84,0.52,2.0,You I agree.
35303,PS5,3,119.84,123.2,3.36,2.0,"In that case you would you have again, I'm the I'm the lawyer."
35303,PS5,3,123.2,129.04,5.84,2.0,"I should know the term, but basically you can't join a competing business for so long after you resigned."
35303,PS5,3,129.16,129.68,0.52,2.0,In which case?
35303,PS5,3,130.12,131.72,1.6,3.0,"It's also yeah, to be fair."
35303,PS5,3,132.44,135.72,3.28,3.0,"But what if they're like, they want to have kids or something?"
35303,PS5,3,136.08,138.56,2.48,2.0,"Oh, you can't literally ban people from leaving your."
35303,PS5,3,141.04,142.36,1.32,3.0,That's what it wants us to.
35303,PS5,3,142.6,144.44,1.84,2.0,"OK, that's in that case enough."
35303,PS5,3,144.44,145.24,0.8,2.0,Really is the only option.
35303,PS5,3,146.48,146.64,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS5,3,146.64,150.84,4.2,2.0,At this time then you have to take away one and three like just liberty.
35303,PS5,3,151.6,153.84,2.24,3.0,"Yeah, but that doesn't I'm, I'm not, I'm not."
35303,PS5,3,154.0,156.6,2.6,3.0,I'm just saying your answers are what actually happens.
35303,PS5,3,156.6,159.2,2.6,3.0,"But like you want to stop them leaving, you know?"
35303,PS5,3,159.2,159.72,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35303,PS5,3,164.0,165.48,1.48,2.0,I'm OK with the getting that option.
35303,PS5,3,165.48,165.8,0.32,2.0,I'd like.
35303,PS5,3,167.0,170.32,3.32,2.0,"I mean if you say you have to stop liberty, then you have to stop liberty."
35303,PS5,3,170.44,172.52,2.08,2.0,You can't just give them incentive there.
35303,PS5,3,172.52,172.68,0.16,2.0,Stop.
35303,PS5,3,172.92,174.8,1.88,3.0,Voluntary employee attrition.
35303,PS5,3,174.8,175.96,1.16,3.0,Stop them leaving.
35303,PS5,3,176.08,178.12,2.04,3.0,Give them some incentive not to leave.
35303,PS5,3,178.48,180.36,1.88,3.0,"Which is, yeah."
35303,PS5,3,182.52,185.64,3.12,2.0,"Just lock them in, just like, have you seen Severance?"
35303,PS5,3,187.28,188.32,1.04,2.0,"No, it's on Apple TV."
35303,PS5,3,188.32,188.72,0.4,2.0,It's a show.
35303,PS5,3,188.72,189.4,0.68,2.0,Basically.
35303,PS5,3,190.88,194.28,3.4,2.0,There are these employees and they they now explain how this happens.
35303,PS5,3,194.28,197.12,2.84,2.0,"So as soon as you enter the office, you have a new personality."
35303,PS5,3,197.12,200.76,3.64,2.0,"So you have no idea what happened in your life outside or who you are, who your friends."
35303,PS5,3,200.76,204.6,3.84,2.0,You just forget you're a new person inside the office and you come out and a new person outside the office.
35303,PS5,3,205.08,208.2,3.12,2.0,"And so as a newer, you're old self outside the office."
35303,PS5,3,208.2,211.08,2.88,2.0,"And so when you're outside the office, you have no idea what happened during the day."
35303,PS5,3,211.32,214.76,3.44,2.0,So you can never dislike your job because you don't know what your job even is.
35303,PS5,3,215.2,221.32,6.12,2.0,"And so they actually want to quit, but the only way to quit is to ask their full selves to quit."
35303,PS5,3,221.32,224.4,3.08,2.0,"But they're like, no, this is a great job because I don't have to be tired to go."
35303,PS5,3,224.4,225.32,0.92,2.0,I don't have to do anything.
35303,PS5,3,225.32,226.12,0.8,2.0,I just get money back.
35303,PS5,3,226.44,227.92,1.48,2.0,"So no, I'm not going to quit this job."
35303,PS5,3,227.96,230.96,3.0,2.0,Even though their personalities inside the office do say they want to quit.
35303,PS5,3,233.32,233.46,0.14,1.0,Sci-fi.
35303,PS5,3,237.28,245.92,8.64,3.0,"Yeah, I just think we need to find something that's more important to them than leaving a horrible job, and that's probably the family that they're working for."
35303,PS5,3,246.16,246.6,0.44,1.0,That's true.
35303,PS5,3,246.6,246.76,0.16,1.0,That's.
35303,PS5,3,246.84,255.04,8.2,2.0,"True, it's either that I agree or you literally we have no severance was not to take you to severance your risk just physically like you can't you physically cannot leave."
35303,PS5,3,255.92,257.96,2.04,2.0,It's your imagine you work at Disney World.
35303,PS5,3,258.44,259.44,1.0,2.0,"OK, so it is a big campus."
35303,PS5,3,259.44,262.6,3.16,2.0,It's not one building but to dose to Disney World a lot.
35303,PS5,3,262.72,268.92,6.2,2.0,Like you can't physically go outside you you'll get your food here but you can't you effectively in prison.
35303,PS5,3,269.2,269.88,0.68,3.0,Like an employee.
35303,PS5,3,269.96,271.2,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, you were in prison."
35303,PS5,3,271.2,271.72,0.52,2.0,Imagine that.
35303,PS5,3,271.72,272.92,1.2,2.0,How are you going to quit?
35303,PS5,3,275.88,285.0,9.12,3.0,"Just have an extremely, extremely long hallway for the quitting centre and you have to walk for like 20 days straight with no food or water."
35303,PS5,3,285.0,287.96,2.96,3.0,And that's when you reach the point where you can tell the guy like I want to quit.
35303,PS5,3,287.96,289.0,1.04,3.0,So like no one does that.
35303,PS5,3,289.4,290.6,1.2,2.0,"No, like you can't even do that."
35303,PS5,3,290.6,291.48,0.88,2.0,Take with their choice.
35303,PS5,3,291.48,292.56,1.08,2.0,You just don't have an option.
35303,PS5,3,292.64,293.64,1.0,2.0,You're literally in prison.
35303,PS5,3,297.28,297.96,0.68,1.0,That's interesting though.
35303,PS5,3,299.92,300.08,0.16,2.0,OK.
35303,PS5,3,300.16,302.6,2.44,2.0,I don't like this idea because that what equality?
35303,PS5,3,302.76,303.24,0.48,2.0,You're right.
35303,PS5,3,303.24,306.48,3.24,2.0,The question is that you stop it and you don't disincentivize it.
35303,PS5,3,307.88,308.4,0.52,3.0,Yeah.
35303,PS5,3,308.64,324.48,15.84,3.0,"No, I think if we put the if, if we didn't, like you said, had an employee city, except the place where they have to go in order to be able to resign to their job is like on top of Mount Everest or something, then they cannot resign unless they go to the top of Mount Everest."
35303,PS5,3,324.48,327.2,2.72,3.0,"How are they going to do that with the tiny salary that you give them, right?"
35303,PS5,3,327.64,330.52,2.88,1.0,"Yeah, capitals."
35303,PS5,3,336.88,339.08,2.2,1.0,"So OK, what should be right there?"
35303,PS5,3,343.0,347.56,4.56,3.0,I say only allow employees to resign if they go to the top of Mount Everest.
35303,PS5,3,348.8,353.08,4.28,3.0,"OK, place a resigning centre at the top of Mount Everest and that's it."

35852,PS2,3,239.8,241.24,1.44,1.0,Mergers and acquisitions.
35852,PS2,3,244.28,245.08,0.8,3.0,Interdependence.
35852,PS2,3,245.12,245.48,0.36,3.0,I don't.
35852,PS2,3,247.76,250.32,2.56,2.0,Know is it?
35852,PS2,3,253.0,262.16,9.16,1.0,"Yeah, I think interdependence or contract based interdependence increased."
35852,PS2,3,266.32,267.04,0.72,2.0,Security.
35852,PS2,3,267.48,269.32,1.84,1.0,About supply.
35852,PS2,3,305.44,306.92,1.48,2.0,What's the creativity?
35852,PS2,3,307.68,310.56,2.88,2.0,I have idea but I don't know if it's creativity.
35852,PS2,3,311.96,316.68,4.72,2.0,You can set up your own company to sell to the products you need.
35852,PS2,3,319.48,321.88,2.4,2.0,I think most companies already done this.
35852,PS2,3,340.12,343.8,3.68,1.0,I guess to proceed next.
36490,PS1,6,24.95,25.43,0.48,1.0,It's a tough one.
36490,PS1,6,25.43,41.56,16.13,1.0,"I mean, there's already so many strategies to produce plastic use, like replacing plastic straws, paper straws, recycling, trying to clean up the ocean."
36490,PS1,6,41.56,45.84,4.28,1.0,I'm trying to think of something outside of that that would be affected.
36490,PS1,6,46.92,52.88,5.96,2.0,Substitute every substitute plastic use.
36490,PS1,6,52.96,58.64,5.68,2.0,"Like let's say for anything you can use plastic for, there should be a substitution for that."
36490,PS1,6,59.08,59.72,0.64,3.0,It's for us.
36490,PS1,6,60.32,62.16,1.84,2.0,With any other thing there's no plastic.
36490,PS1,6,63.12,67.4,4.28,2.0,"Depends on the paper bags, just as you say Peppers."
36490,PS1,6,67.56,67.8,0.24,4.0,Or.
36490,PS1,6,68.84,74.84,6.0,5.0,"Chairs like apart from plastic bags, the other things we do with plastic or bottles?"
36490,PS1,6,74.96,77.2,2.24,2.0,"You know, stainless for the bottle."
36490,PS1,6,77.36,82.92,5.56,2.0,So we're replacing every plastic use everything that we prepare plastic for.
36490,PS1,6,83.48,86.36,2.88,6.0,I think there are there reasons people use plastic sometimes.
36490,PS1,6,86.36,87.96,1.6,6.0,They're kind of free.
36490,PS1,6,87.96,91.2,3.24,6.0,They cannot put in anything else like a metal or tail.
36490,PS1,6,91.84,93.6,1.76,6.0,We have to put in plastic that's.
36490,PS1,6,94.12,114.84,20.72,3.0,Obvious plastics so it's not it's not a much you must actually use plastics so the essence of this study is for us to device an alternative means to plastic right I believe foil to some extent can serve then there is another material that they use in packaging new T VS I can't remember the.
36490,PS1,6,114.84,115.12,0.28,2.0,Name it's.
36490,PS1,6,115.72,116.28,0.56,5.0,Pyro foams.
36490,PS1,6,117.04,124.6,7.56,3.0,"Yeah, I think it can also work if you can develop different sizes and chips and it's also waterproof do."
36490,PS1,6,125.64,129.6,3.96,2.0,We necessarily need to Do we necessarily.
36490,PS1,6,129.64,135.16,5.52,3.0,"Need to minimize, we are also minimizing and also minimizing the use."
36490,PS1,6,135.2,137.96,2.76,3.0,I think an increase recycling just like you said.
36490,PS1,6,138.4,139.68,1.28,6.0,Recycling is already happened.
36490,PS1,6,140.64,141.12,0.48,3.0,So increase.
36490,PS1,6,141.12,141.36,0.24,2.0,At the I'm.
36490,PS1,6,141.4,141.64,0.24,3.0,Thinking.
36490,PS1,6,142.08,148.28,6.2,5.0,Of idea of these are using people's mind in using the plastic itself.
36490,PS1,6,149.08,155.32,6.24,5.0,You understand that you cannot totally stop plastic use of plastic without people becoming aware.
36490,PS1,6,155.32,158.76,3.44,5.0,"OK, this is the dangers associated with the use of plastic."
36490,PS1,6,159.24,162.28,3.04,5.0,Kindly stop using plastic.
36490,PS1,6,162.48,165.6,3.12,5.0,So what do we do to get people to stop using plastic?
36490,PS1,6,165.88,171.24,5.36,5.0,"That way, if people are not using plastic, companies would tend not to produce it because people are patronizing it coming."
36490,PS1,6,172.76,185.2,12.44,2.0,"From them, do you know there has been sensitive like to sensitize people about plastic and people are still using is in the media and people are still using is in."
36490,PS1,6,185.24,185.64,0.4,5.0,The media.
36490,PS1,6,185.64,188.04,2.4,5.0,Does my grandmother know that she shouldn't use plastic?
36490,PS1,6,190.56,193.04,2.48,3.0,"So I think all of us, we are right, we are all right."
36490,PS1,6,193.28,196.24,2.96,3.0,But what we are looking for is to reduce.
36490,PS1,6,196.24,198.56,2.32,3.0,It's not as if we want to totally stop.
36490,PS1,6,198.92,214.76,15.84,3.0,"So you can increase the sensitization, Gerry sensitization, we can increase the level of sensitization, We can increase the number of searches, OK, that have to do with the side effects of nanoparticles in plastics."
36490,PS1,6,215.2,218.48,3.28,3.0,Then we can also increase the rate of recycling.
36490,PS1,6,219.0,224.4,5.4,3.0,Then substitutions we can look for alternatives to plastic and increase their use.
36490,PS1,6,224.68,228.6,3.92,2.0,What is the tax high companies that produce plastics?
36490,PS1,6,229.04,231.32,2.28,4.0,Then they just pass on to consumer.
36490,PS1,6,232.24,232.56,0.32,1.0,It's true.
36490,PS1,6,232.72,233.52,0.8,1.0,"I mean, it's interesting."
36490,PS1,6,233.52,240.32,6.8,2.0,"So when it's too sorry, when it's too expensive, people will look for another means instead of going for plastics."
36490,PS1,6,241.52,247.08,5.56,2.0,"When plastic products are too expensive, people tend to go for alternatives."
36490,PS1,6,247.36,251.24,3.88,3.0,And that alternative should be available and they should also.
36490,PS1,6,251.24,251.32,0.08,4.0,Be.
36490,PS1,6,251.76,258.36,6.6,5.0,Looking for a similar idea that should cut across all of these things you said that is creative enough to actually.
36490,PS1,6,258.8,263.76,4.96,1.0,"Visit It's interesting is what we've been judged on is creativity, like taxation can be very effective."
36490,PS1,6,264.16,264.96,0.8,1.0,Is it creative?
36490,PS1,6,265.0,268.92,3.92,1.0,"I mean, I guess that depends on one's bad definition of creativity."
36490,PS1,6,268.92,271.84,2.92,1.0,But it's interesting because like there's lots of interesting conversations we've had.
36490,PS1,6,271.84,278.36,6.52,1.0,"We've talked about finding substitutes, increasing awareness of the environmental harms of plastic."
36490,PS1,6,278.56,282.28,3.72,1.0,And then we've just had a conversation about how we allocate responsibility.
36490,PS1,6,282.4,287.12,4.72,1.0,Is it corporations and companies or is it individual consumers like all of us here?
36490,PS1,6,287.4,287.76,0.36,1.0,How?
36490,PS1,6,287.92,301.24,13.32,1.0,"What Like if we also are talking about responsibility, what's going to be more effective in reducing plastic pollution, focusing the responsibility on the provider, the companies or the consumer?"
36490,PS1,6,301.36,301.72,0.36,1.0,I don't know.
36490,PS1,6,301.72,302.52,0.8,1.0,It's just a thought.
36490,PS1,6,303.0,303.32,0.32,5.0,Producer.
36490,PS1,6,305.68,308.96,3.28,6.0,Can we get something that makes plastic disappear after use?
36490,PS1,6,309.68,309.72,0.04,4.0,Oh.
36490,PS1,6,310.16,310.56,0.4,1.0,That would be.
36490,PS1,6,310.92,314.2,3.28,4.0,A miracle types of plastics.
36490,PS1,6,314.24,325.48,11.24,4.0,"If you look at the structure of it, you can decide in a structure some way which battery is able to break it down easier."
36490,PS1,6,326.32,331.72,5.4,4.0,So instead of thousands of years it could break into 10s of hundreds of years it could break down.
36490,PS1,6,334.84,342.76,7.92,4.0,The other thing I was thinking about is that good thing with plastic is slight it's cheap and it's quite non reactive.
36490,PS1,6,342.84,349.36,6.52,4.0,But with a lot of things you throw away we don't always need to last for such a long time.
36490,PS1,6,349.36,357.36,8.0,4.0,So if you just replace some of it with perhaps materials could eat is a plastic wrappers which would throw away.
36490,PS1,6,357.36,362.24,4.88,4.0,"If a wrapper is something you could eat, then you reduce waste in itself."
36490,PS1,6,363.48,363.92,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
36490,PS1,6,363.92,369.52,5.6,1.0,So using like literally like biodegradable and even edible substitute.
36490,PS1,6,369.52,369.96,0.44,3.0,5 minutes.
36490,PS1,6,370.52,371.96,1.44,1.0,5 minutes yeah.
36490,PS1,6,372.44,375.92,3.48,1.0,"OK, so we need an idea I."
36490,PS1,6,388.04,395.36,7.32,5.0,"Think still feels like or use plastic, you get refined, you know."
36490,PS1,6,395.92,396.4,0.48,6.0,What about?
36490,PS1,6,396.92,400.56,3.64,3.0,What about and also improvisation?
36490,PS1,6,401.04,401.84,0.8,3.0,Improvisation.
36490,PS1,6,402.72,403.44,0.72,2.0,Some companies.
36490,PS1,6,403.8,405.04,1.24,5.0,"Yeah, legislation."
36490,PS1,6,405.28,408.32,3.04,5.0,Use the government to find people that produce plastic that is.
36490,PS1,6,408.4,413.28,4.88,2.0,It increase in taxation and no one that can use maybe is that is that.
36490,PS1,6,413.32,413.56,0.24,6.0,Something.
36490,PS1,6,416.32,416.52,0.2,1.0,That's.
36490,PS1,6,416.84,417.32,0.48,3.0,Not creative.
36490,PS1,6,417.52,418.84,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36490,PS1,6,418.84,420.12,1.28,1.0,Or like I had an idea.
36490,PS1,6,420.12,420.4,0.28,1.0,I don't know.
36490,PS1,6,420.44,425.36,4.92,1.0,"I don't know if it's better than yours, but like this is putting more focus on the on the consumer."
36490,PS1,6,426.28,431.76,5.48,1.0,"But like, let's say everyone had like a digital bin in their special fancy bin in the in the kitchen."
36490,PS1,6,432.0,437.96,5.96,1.0,"And it would kind of measure like your, your use of plastic, how many plastic products you're buying."
36490,PS1,6,439.64,446.72,7.08,1.0,"And perhaps there was like some incentive so that if you put less, there's always to break this, but you put less plastic items there."
36490,PS1,6,446.84,450.76,3.92,1.0,"And there's a way that they, it's, it's, it's honest reflection of your use."
36490,PS1,6,451.72,456.56,4.84,1.0,You get like like a voucher money or some kind of reward.
36490,PS1,6,456.88,463.04,6.16,1.0,"I said, I'll just write it."
36490,PS1,6,463.04,472.04,9.0,1.0,"And if there's a better idea, I'll I'll just just just redesign people have special."
36490,PS1,6,473.64,480.16,6.52,4.0,"Thing is sort of similar to those, you know, milk bottles that you get $0.05 back if you return."
36490,PS1,6,480.16,485.36,5.2,4.0,Then you could apply for plastics instead instead the plastic counter.
36490,PS1,6,487.12,489.08,1.96,2.0,"That's what you say, Candle."
36490,PS1,6,499.76,500.52,0.76,2.0,Combination.
36490,PS1,6,545.88,547.2,1.32,2.0,That will get it from there.
36490,PS1,6,547.96,552.96,5.0,2.0,It will increase pollution because I will not want to put it in the bin.
36490,PS1,6,552.96,553.88,0.92,1.0,I know that's true.
36490,PS1,6,554.04,555.8,1.76,1.0,"I know, I know it's true."
36490,PS1,6,556.2,559.12,2.92,1.0,"It's it's exactly, it's there's a way to rig it."
36490,PS1,6,559.12,563.52,4.4,1.0,"It's a There's a flaw in the thinking so, but."
36490,PS1,6,564.32,565.24,0.92,2.0,Don't clean that.
36490,PS1,6,565.76,568.12,2.36,1.0,"It is creative, but it's got some holes in it."
36490,PS1,6,568.76,574.84,6.08,2.0,"So I think probably the more that is in your recyclable bin, the more money you get."
36490,PS1,6,575.48,576.52,1.04,2.0,So people will have don't.
36490,PS1,6,576.52,578.92,2.4,3.0,"Actually, I don't actually think you should be in the bin."
36490,PS1,6,579.08,585.04,5.96,3.0,There should be a meter in your house that gets plastic whenever you bring in your house.
36490,PS1,6,585.04,592.32,7.28,3.0,You don't need to use so far as you are using it so far as the house is monitored so that you don't use and do it.
36490,PS1,6,592.4,592.48,0.08,4.0,The.
36490,PS1,6,592.52,597.24,4.72,6.0,Way time so I I was thinking kitchens that identify the one identify.
36490,PS1,6,599.8,601.68,1.88,4.0,Or just how much plastic you buy.
36490,PS1,6,601.68,609.96,8.28,4.0,"If if we're in a cashless society, then any electronic payment would be linked to the plastic content of anything you buy."

36490,PS1,6,667.04,672.2,5.16,1.0,"OK, so I've said people have special bins in their kitchens that identify and measure the waste products they place inside of them."
36490,PS1,6,672.2,674.64,2.44,1.0,These bins can detect plastic products placed inside of them.
36490,PS1,6,675.08,683.44,8.36,1.0,Individual households will have their monthly plastic usage measured and if they're shown to recycle their plastic goods often they they will be.
36490,PS1,6,685.84,691.48,5.64,1.0,"There will be, they will be, they will be financially rewarded."
36490,PS1,6,691.48,705.2,13.72,1.0,"This will create a greater incentive for people to recycle and dispose of their plastics responsibly, which will result in reduction of plastic pollution while."
36386,PS6,3,1.8,7.56,5.76,1.0,Imagine A new research study discovered that singing in the shower for 20 minutes or more is good for health.
36386,PS6,3,7.56,8.48,0.92,1.0,One creative idea.
36386,PS6,3,9.68,12.32,2.64,2.0,To encourage people to sing.
36386,PS6,3,17.52,22.08,4.56,1.0,One creative idea would be to is not to print it on the print media.

36386,PS6,3,148.16,157.84,9.68,2.0,"Speaker No, the device will not just be put it somewhere in the bathroom, one that is connected to the shower you really like."
36386,PS6,3,157.96,158.84,0.88,3.0,You know the problem man.
36386,PS6,3,158.84,164.0,5.16,3.0,"If you say put it in the bathroom, people will not ordinarily go and buy it and put, but if it is coming with the shower is."

36386,PS6,3,176.4,176.8,0.4,3.0,To make.
36386,PS6,3,177.12,178.76,1.64,2.0,"Well, you don't put it in the shower, yes."
36386,PS6,3,179.2,179.6,0.4,1.0,But The thing is.
36386,PS6,3,180.6,182.0,1.4,3.0,Incorporated to the shower.

35315,PS2,6,26.64,29.48,2.84,1.0,I think this is my major what it's.
35315,PS2,6,29.48,29.8,0.32,3.0,Kind.
35315,PS2,6,29.84,31.88,2.04,1.0,Of like the one major that.
35315,PS2,6,32.24,33.8,1.56,3.0,Kind of things like because.
35315,PS2,6,33.8,34.4,0.6,1.0,Supply chain.
35315,PS2,6,34.88,41.0,6.12,3.0,What we gonna to use is like we would like build out the model and simulation.
35315,PS2,6,41.4,43.2,1.8,4.0,Like mimic what they would gonna.
35315,PS2,6,43.44,52.56,9.12,3.0,"Happen for example, like the food for example, like that ice kind of part of they have the cold supply chain and the."
35315,PS2,6,52.6,52.8,0.2,1.0,2nd.
35315,PS2,6,52.8,60.04,7.24,3.0,"One, for example, like some kinds of that we use like the food waste as supply chains and that would happen."
35315,PS2,6,60.04,68.4,8.36,3.0,"I think some uncontrollable things for example, like pet the virus pandemic or kind of like issues."
35315,PS2,6,69.12,75.92,6.8,3.0,All we're going to do is we're going to like just build up a model to optimize like what?
35315,PS2,6,76.12,77.72,1.6,3.0,Which role would be better?
35315,PS2,6,77.96,84.92,6.96,3.0,"Like which one is the minimum, maximums the perfect and minimums the uncontrollable?"
35315,PS2,6,85.16,85.72,0.56,1.0,Issues.
35315,PS2,6,86.36,87.6,1.24,2.0,That makes sense as.
35315,PS2,6,87.6,88.44,0.84,3.0,Simulation.
35315,PS2,6,88.56,90.08,1.52,4.0,Before the they use it.

35315,PS2,6,96.0,97.12,1.12,1.0,Means we can just launch.
35315,PS2,6,98.24,101.92,3.68,2.0,The technologies to trace the maximum watch.

35315,PS2,6,137.96,138.6,0.64,3.0,Maybe also.
35315,PS2,6,138.6,146.4,7.8,5.0,Like having this be like a more transparent model because people could also adjust their consumption patterns for some goods.
35315,PS2,6,146.4,146.52,0.12,5.0,This.
35315,PS2,6,148.08,148.16,0.08,1.0,Is.

35315,PS2,6,151.48,155.4,3.92,6.0,What are the technical security issue?
35315,PS2,6,155.4,163.6,8.2,6.0,"And then we put some model and model, we built some predictive analytics and we know which points to be critical and different."
35315,PS2,6,173.72,174.68,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, they also."
35315,PS2,6,174.76,174.96,0.2,3.0,Called.
35315,PS2,6,174.96,177.44,2.48,1.0,It is collaboration and partnership.
35315,PS2,6,177.88,179.52,1.64,1.0,It means when we go to a different.
35315,PS2,6,179.52,181.32,1.8,3.0,Place the other would like.
35315,PS2,6,181.32,182.2,0.88,1.0,Change the place.
35315,PS2,6,182.32,182.56,0.24,3.0,And.

35229,PS4,3,142.16,142.56,0.4,1.0,What else?
35229,PS4,3,142.56,143.52,0.96,2.0,Could become free.
35229,PS4,3,147.16,148.0,0.84,1.0,Remove public.
35229,PS4,3,148.04,149.24,1.2,1.0,Remove private schools.

35229,PS4,3,187.07,188.91,1.84,1.0,There are countries that know private schools.
35229,PS4,3,189.19,189.39,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35229,PS4,3,190.0,190.68,0.68,1.0,For example.
35229,PS4,3,190.8,195.0,4.2,2.0,Actually in Sweden you need to go to the state.
35229,PS4,3,195.68,199.08,3.4,1.0,"Like even colleges, they have colleges which are."
35229,PS4,3,202.08,204.36,2.28,2.0,"When you like, if you go to like high school."
35229,PS4,3,204.6,206.16,1.56,1.0,"Yes, like university."
35229,PS4,3,206.24,210.36,4.12,2.0,"University, yeah, there are probably some private ones with like."
35229,PS4,3,210.68,210.92,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35229,PS4,3,211.92,213.16,1.24,2.0,The best ones are public.
35229,PS4,3,213.4,220.16,6.76,1.0,"I mean that, OK, that's just one country and so many other countries, like if you go down to like the US, for example, on the South or like the gigs are, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35229,PS4,3,220.48,220.76,0.28,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."

35229,PS4,3,222.96,223.44,0.48,1.0,But like there.
35229,PS4,3,223.56,227.12,3.56,2.0,"Are many countries that, you know, like education is in principle free?"
35229,PS4,3,227.52,227.72,0.2,2.0,OK.
35229,PS4,3,227.72,232.64,4.92,2.0,"There are some probably cost with studies like yeah, materials."
35229,PS4,3,232.92,234.36,1.44,1.0,In most countries it isn't free.
35229,PS4,3,235.16,237.64,2.48,1.0,Like UK is one of them where like schooling is free.
35229,PS4,3,238.12,240.16,2.04,2.0,"Well, like in Europe is in most of them is free."
35229,PS4,3,240.92,256.4,15.48,1.0,"But outside Europe, I don't think any countries like you take any country in Asia as well, and even the North American region, even in South America."
35229,PS4,3,259.72,264.2,4.48,3.0,In Asia there's a lot of like extra like tuition centres.
35229,PS4,3,264.32,265.64,1.32,1.0,"Like, yeah, Oh my God, yeah."
35229,PS4,3,265.84,273.2,7.36,1.0,"Every every exam after paying school, you have to go and start for all your entrance exams that pay extra to study."
35229,PS4,3,275.48,278.12,2.64,1.0,So it's it's just good out.
35229,PS4,3,279.56,280.0,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, I guess."
35229,PS4,3,287.08,288.6,1.52,3.0,Been extra classes outside of school.
35229,PS4,3,290.28,292.6,2.32,3.0,"No, it's like like."
35229,PS4,3,295.08,296.12,1.04,2.0,It's hard to bundle to.
35229,PS4,3,296.6,301.56,4.96,1.0,"See another reason people don't go to school, at least like poor people, is because they can earn money instead."
35229,PS4,3,303.16,306.88,3.72,1.0,"If they don't go to school and they work like at a farm, at that point in time they earn money."
35229,PS4,3,307.64,312.76,5.12,1.0,"So like for example your point itself, like Sweden pays people to go to school."
35229,PS4,3,314.2,317.88,3.68,1.0,"If you attend school, if you send your child to school, you get paid for the year."
35229,PS4,3,319.6,319.88,0.28,2.0,"Yeah, maybe."
35229,PS4,3,320.04,320.44,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35229,PS4,3,321.56,324.24,2.68,1.0,So make it the other way around.
35229,PS4,3,326.48,331.88,5.4,2.0,"Yeah, instead of like extra classes, it's hard to buy an extra class because like, how do you do that?"
35229,PS4,3,331.88,343.88,12.0,2.0,But like you can offer students like like like that after class they can just take for like advice like free.
35229,PS4,3,344.6,345.04,0.44,1.0,Let's say.
35229,PS4,3,345.2,346.08,0.88,2.0,"Counselling, yeah."

34483,PS3,3,484.88,485.84,0.96,1.0,It's not a solution.
34483,PS3,3,485.84,487.04,1.2,3.0,We have to give only one solution.
34483,PS3,3,487.04,488.2,1.16,3.0,Is that a requirement?

34483,PS3,3,532.96,536.76,3.8,2.0,But I mean if we're trying to also said it's something applicable applicable like.
34483,PS3,3,537.36,539.6,2.24,1.0,"No, it's not saying that needs to be applicable now, OK."
34483,PS3,3,539.8,540.92,1.12,1.0,It just needs to be creative.
34483,PS3,3,541.68,551.12,9.44,2.0,"OK, I'll still stay with one of the their two because it's more are more ready to use which is."
34483,PS3,3,551.44,554.12,2.68,1.0,"It's not creative, it's just like you tell people that they can."
34483,PS3,3,554.12,557.16,3.04,2.0,"Say, yeah, just an alternative there."
34483,PS3,3,557.32,558.28,0.96,1.0,Is just like.
34483,PS3,3,558.44,559.2,0.76,2.0,It's basic.
34483,PS3,3,559.28,559.88,0.6,2.0,It's true.
34483,PS3,3,560.08,561.24,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, it's true."
34483,PS3,3,561.24,561.92,0.68,2.0,That is basic.
34483,PS3,3,563.48,564.4,0.92,1.0,I'm not convinced.
34483,PS3,3,564.68,565.6,0.92,2.0,"OK, which one?"
34483,PS3,3,565.64,566.24,0.6,2.0,What do you say?
34483,PS3,3,566.56,567.36,0.8,3.0,What are the two options?
34483,PS3,3,568.48,573.0,4.52,1.0,Empower the use of word excuse me and inform people of alternative words for sorry.
34483,PS3,3,573.04,574.44,1.4,2.0,"Oh no, the other ones is the."
34483,PS3,3,574.68,575.56,0.88,1.0,"The machine, the machine."
34483,PS3,3,575.56,580.04,4.48,1.0,I think some machine that when you say sorry it changes to something else.
34483,PS3,3,581.92,583.04,1.12,1.0,I just like speak.
34483,PS3,3,584.24,585.68,1.44,1.0,I'll allow the allow the beep I.

34483,PS3,3,588.12,594.76,6.64,3.0,"Sorry, the machine thing because if you want to make, because that's an easier thing to do to control a pandemic."
34483,PS3,3,596.96,598.12,1.16,1.0,Machine that does what?
34483,PS3,3,598.68,601.12,2.44,3.0,"So either changes the word, or shocks you, or changes the word."
34483,PS3,3,601.52,611.48,9.96,1.0,"I think that the allow aloud beep can be good because then it's like it's not a shock that human rights people can say something, but it conditions you."
34483,PS3,3,611.6,616.6,5.0,1.0,It's like the dogs when you say that you'll hear a noise that you don't like.
34483,PS3,3,616.8,619.32,2.52,1.0,"So then OK, sure."

34483,PS3,3,625.8,634.68,8.88,1.0,"So then when someone says sorry, and then people like, OK, can say that, yeah."
34483,PS3,3,642.04,646.36,4.32,1.0,"But then also with that, of course, empower the use of other words and inform people."

34612,PS6,6,205.76,208.16,2.4,5.0,"So I can I can listen to songs, but I Can't Sing."
34612,PS6,6,209.8,217.8,8.0,4.0,"Yeah, like design, like the structure to have like be more echoey, because I do sing in the shower and I do find more enjoyable when it's echoey."
34612,PS6,6,218.28,225.48,7.2,5.0,"And especially I feel, I genuinely, I feel that when the lyrics are there, at least I know OK, the the lyrics are there, I'll like try and."

34612,PS6,6,234.96,236.32,1.36,3.0,I thought of the perfect incentive.
34612,PS6,6,236.32,240.2,3.88,3.0,Remove the latches from the doors so you sing to let people know that you're inside.
34612,PS6,6,243.24,248.32,5.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, if you don't sing that."

34612,PS6,6,261.24,262.36,1.12,1.0,You were saying you're not creative.
34612,PS6,6,262.36,265.68,3.32,1.0,This is the most incentive you could even have.
34612,PS6,6,265.68,265.8,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34612,PS6,6,267.28,268.84,1.56,3.0,I went to boarding school now so.
34612,PS6,6,271.24,271.84,0.6,2.0,"OK, next."
34612,PS6,6,272.64,273.28,0.64,1.0,I think we're good.
34612,PS6,6,275.12,276.64,1.52,6.0,One creative ideal solution.
34612,PS6,6,276.64,276.68,0.04,6.0,Oh.
34612,PS6,6,277.48,279.16,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, we're supposed to give one only."
34612,PS6,6,279.56,280.16,0.6,2.0,Oh.
34612,PS6,6,280.68,281.36,0.68,5.0,That's fine.
34612,PS6,6,282.0,286.16,4.16,4.0,"Well, oh, I feel that you need to elaborate a lot by so if I it's like a combined thing."
34612,PS6,6,289.8,291.2,1.4,3.0,So has it come from like?
34612,PS6,6,291.8,293.24,1.44,2.0,Please talk with one creative idea to.
34612,PS6,6,293.4,294.88,1.48,3.0,Singing in the shower to such.
34612,PS6,6,294.88,296.08,1.2,1.0,It's very random questions.
34612,PS6,6,296.32,296.52,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
34612,PS6,6,297.44,300.32,2.88,1.0,"I'll tell you the last time one day, the one that we end up is so."
36354,PS2,6,41.72,48.08,6.36,1.0,I guess by identifying vulnerabilities and then like what specific vulnerabilities are.
36354,PS2,6,51.68,55.2,3.52,2.0,"Which supplies can be talking about that We're not giving enough information on it, but in."
36354,PS2,6,55.2,57.88,2.68,3.0,"General, I think it would be a good idea to digitize it."
36354,PS2,6,58.72,59.16,0.44,4.0,So.
36354,PS2,6,60.88,61.68,0.8,2.0,Online tracking.
36354,PS2,6,61.68,64.28,2.6,4.0,Mechanism you see at the websites or applications.
36354,PS2,6,69.2,70.56,1.36,1.0,Weight tracking tracking.
36354,PS2,6,70.56,71.16,0.6,2.0,Mechanisms.
36354,PS2,6,71.68,73.4,1.72,4.0,Through applications.
36354,PS2,6,74.6,75.12,0.52,2.0,Or.
36354,PS2,6,75.52,75.96,0.44,4.0,Websites.
36354,PS2,6,96.36,96.96,0.6,4.0,"Oh, there it is."
36354,PS2,6,100.6,102.16,1.56,5.0,Maybe a way you could check like.
36354,PS2,6,103.24,107.08,3.84,6.0,"How much you've got like available like stock management, That's how I feel like inventory."
36354,PS2,6,145.11,148.19,3.08,1.0,"Should be that so, yeah."
35922,PS5,3,7.48,8.32,0.84,1.0,Give them more.
35922,PS5,3,8.32,11.64,3.32,2.0,Material creative solution.
35922,PS5,3,21.04,22.36,1.32,1.0,"It's not creative, but."
35922,PS5,3,24.76,25.52,0.76,2.0,Just give them more money.
35922,PS5,3,25.52,25.68,0.16,2.0,Just.
35922,PS5,3,25.84,29.96,4.12,1.0,"For personal, in terms of personal experience, it's just recognition of talent."
35922,PS5,3,30.28,31.12,0.84,2.0,Recognition of.
35922,PS5,3,31.32,32.72,1.4,1.0,Talent and you can do those.
35922,PS5,3,33.52,35.56,2.04,2.0,I will write that down right now because last year.
35922,PS5,3,35.96,38.36,2.4,1.0,"Yeah, definition of talent through different phase."
35922,PS5,3,40.68,43.24,2.56,1.0,"Yeah, I mean I've worked in corporate for four years."
35922,PS5,3,51.72,57.6,5.88,1.0,"So it's a, it sounds like a very super thing that it worked out for us."
35922,PS5,3,58.04,66.64,8.6,1.0,"We used to get these points every time someone was happy with someone's work, need not be from your team, just like across the corporate ladder."
35922,PS5,3,66.96,74.2,7.24,1.0,And you would get those points online and then you could redeem them for like a voucher and then would convert them into actual INR.
35922,PS5,3,75.64,84.56,8.92,1.0,"And it was just like you, it would get credited to your account every three months and then you would have to use them upon someone or they would relapse."
35922,PS5,3,85.32,95.68,10.36,1.0,So it didn't require anything resource wise a lot because corporates get huge discounts on company vouchers and stuff.
35922,PS5,3,96.04,103.32,7.28,1.0,But it created a morale where I knew some of my employees who would stay a year just to make use of those vouchers that they got.
35922,PS5,3,106.52,107.56,1.04,2.0,That is creative.
35922,PS5,3,107.8,113.96,6.16,1.0,"And that is that's mostly monetary, but I think recognition of talent through."
35922,PS5,3,125.56,128.08,2.52,1.0,Like company wide appreciation or like.
35922,PS5,3,129.88,132.2,2.32,3.0,"In our country actually call it a bonus, right?"
35922,PS5,3,132.2,134.56,2.36,3.0,So at a certain stage then.
35922,PS5,3,134.84,166.0,31.16,1.0,There are certain bonus is not created though or like I know people who went to other offices have worked with other teams just to get them more exposure so that that also sound like an incentive.
35922,PS5,3,166.8,172.28,5.48,3.0,The company has like some policy to switch over like.
35922,PS5,3,172.32,173.52,1.2,1.0,Switch between departments.
35922,PS5,3,173.52,173.84,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35922,PS5,3,174.12,175.2,1.08,2.0,Like job rotation?
35922,PS5,3,175.48,176.52,1.04,3.0,Job rotation you.
35922,PS5,3,176.52,178.64,2.12,1.0,Can do that simpler job rotation.
35922,PS5,3,178.76,179.72,0.96,3.0,So will it help?
35922,PS5,3,181.0,181.52,0.52,1.0,Yes.
35922,PS5,3,182.24,192.28,10.04,3.0,Even within the company job rotation or maybe if they have connection with certain other companies and they exchange employees for certain part of.
35922,PS5,3,192.32,195.64,3.32,1.0,"Oh no, I think that goes against the contract."
35922,PS5,3,196.12,197.96,1.84,2.0,"With that, that would be attrition, yeah."
35922,PS5,3,198.48,203.08,4.6,1.0,Because we can do within company in intra company job rotation.
35922,PS5,3,209.0,210.32,1.32,2.0,Only for people who want it right?
35922,PS5,3,210.36,210.6,0.24,2.0,Because.
35922,PS5,3,212.72,214.56,1.84,2.0,Because you force everyone to do job rotation.
35922,PS5,3,240.16,241.24,1.08,3.0,What does it?
35922,PS5,3,241.48,243.96,2.48,2.0,"Mean restricted stock, so when the company is public."
35922,PS5,3,244.24,245.12,0.88,1.0,You get a share of the.
35922,PS5,3,245.52,245.92,0.4,2.0,"Company, yeah."
35922,PS5,3,246.28,251.44,5.16,1.0,"So whenever you decide to leave, they would calculate how much that share is worth in paying with."
35922,PS5,3,252.0,254.16,2.16,2.0,Cash and when a company is not public you get a.
35922,PS5,3,254.72,258.56,3.84,2.0,So it's like because the company is not public yet you get a share in the company.
35922,PS5,3,258.56,260.88,2.32,2.0,"Whenever it goes public or exits, you can accept it."
35922,PS5,3,269.72,286.08,16.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, because I know like my, my all my in large Yeah, because my, my friend's dad worked for NVIDIA and the only reason he's not leaving NVIDIA is because you know, the NVIDIA desktop is going to go up and he's he's holding on to RSU."
35922,PS5,3,286.16,291.32,5.16,2.0,"A lot of his colleagues are also have RSU's and as soon as you leave the company, you have to cash it out."
35922,PS5,3,291.72,291.8,0.08,2.0,So.
35922,PS5,3,291.8,294.32,2.52,2.0,"But NVIDIA keep rising, so they keep testing in the."
35922,PS5,3,298.44,298.48,0.04,3.0,I.
35922,PS5,3,299.32,300.16,0.84,1.0,Think we need to write it in.
35922,PS5,3,300.28,300.92,0.64,3.0,A full form.
35922,PS5,3,301.28,303.12,1.84,2.0,Mental health initiative you.
35922,PS5,3,303.36,314.84,11.48,3.0,"Can write it in a full form otherwise, so RSU for me was the firm support."
35922,PS5,3,328.08,336.72,8.64,1.0,Mental health initiatives or like my company took us to comedy clubs which was amazing.
35922,PS5,3,337.12,341.0,3.88,2.0,Which company is this in India?
35922,PS5,3,341.0,360.28,19.28,2.0,"You are having such great work culture, but but this won't come under recognition because we are no so essentially, please come up with one creative idea."
35922,PS5,3,360.32,362.92,2.6,2.0,It's saying recognise talent through 1/2.
35922,PS5,3,362.96,368.92,5.96,2.0,These are these are all ways you can recognise talent because good performers are people who are staying will get RSS.
35922,PS5,3,368.92,376.16,7.24,2.0,"Not like if you join, you don't get only after you stay for like some yeah, like lesser micromanaging and stuff."
35922,PS5,3,378.84,379.84,1.0,2.0,How do I just more autonomy?
35922,PS5,3,379.84,380.6,0.76,2.0,More autonomy?
35922,PS5,3,382.68,384.88,2.2,1.0,For project.
35922,PS5,3,385.4,389.12,3.72,2.0,I think that's good.
35922,PS5,3,389.12,389.68,0.56,2.0,That's good enough.
35922,PS5,3,389.68,392.4,2.72,2.0,I think you should move on to keep thinking of fortune.
35922,PS5,3,392.4,392.56,0.16,2.0,I have.
35922,PS5,3,393.48,395.68,2.2,1.0,Endless options.
35922,PS5,3,395.68,397.72,2.04,2.0,We should start your own coming be a great place to work.
36234,PS5,3,2.84,6.68,3.84,1.0,"Finally, I knew what happens when I decided to leave the company retailing a production value talent."
36234,PS5,3,9.24,10.8,1.56,2.0,But to stop people from leaving.
36234,PS5,3,11.0,17.0,6.0,1.0,"Yeah, therapy for empowerment, mandatory therapy for."
36234,PS5,3,17.0,17.96,0.96,2.0,Everyone I know but.
36234,PS5,3,31.12,37.96,6.84,2.0,"You know, you, I would have thought that I had some ideas because most of my friends keep talking about like leaving their jobs."
36234,PS5,3,39.12,42.68,3.56,2.0,"And so it's like you'd think I'd have an idea, but I don't."
36234,PS5,3,55.67,57.43,1.76,2.0,Encouraging sabbaticals maybe clear.
36234,PS5,3,63.39,64.51,1.12,1.0,What does sabbaticals mean?
36234,PS5,3,65.84,66.72,0.88,2.0,How we see.
36234,PS5,3,66.72,67.04,0.32,1.0,This term.
36234,PS5,3,67.04,68.04,1.0,2.0,Like a break.
36234,PS5,3,68.4,69.32,0.92,1.0,"OK, like breaks."
36234,PS5,3,69.48,83.24,13.76,2.0,"Yeah, a breaks to do, like, like a break to do, you know, whatever, like travel or like volunteer or just vegetate, I don't know, just something that allows you to take a break."
36234,PS5,3,83.24,95.76,12.52,1.0,"Like short term leaves, yeah, that allow employees to explore their interests."
36234,PS5,3,95.76,117.6,21.84,1.0,"I know to take, I'll just take brief pauses from their jobs to explore their interests, to rest or explore their interests."
36234,PS5,3,118.32,120.64,2.32,1.0,"I think the company can subsidise these sort of activities, right?"
36234,PS5,3,121.92,124.04,2.12,1.0,The companies will.
36234,PS5,3,125.76,144.36,18.6,2.0,"Well, actually maybe maybe not they could, but but realistically like I don't know if they are expected to, I don't think they would comply or maybe like making it mandatory for this to for for them to."
36234,PS5,3,144.36,148.52,4.16,1.0,"Encourage mandatory, introducing mandatory."
36234,PS5,3,148.88,151.4,2.52,1.0,"Yeah, that's very avant-garde, I think."
36234,PS5,3,151.88,152.6,0.72,2.0,What do you mean?
36234,PS5,3,152.76,155.16,2.4,1.0,"I said like very, very nobody has done that before."
36234,PS5,3,157.08,157.36,0.28,1.0,It's fine.
36234,PS5,3,157.36,158.84,1.48,1.0,We just need to be novel and useful.
36234,PS5,3,158.84,160.68,1.84,1.0,I think this can be novel and very useful.

36449,PS1,6,404.24,407.28,3.04,6.0,Of the the machine is in the job of a man.
36449,PS1,6,408.32,409.8,1.48,2.0,The return of plastic waste.
36449,PS1,6,411.24,411.4,0.16,1.0,No.
36449,PS1,6,413.72,414.4,0.68,2.0,Plastic waste.
36449,PS1,6,414.4,415.0,0.6,2.0,Plastic waste.
34570,PS2,3,20.16,26.2,6.04,2.0,So vulnerabilities within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled cost inefficient delivery schedule.
34570,PS2,3,26.2,31.32,5.12,2.0,"Please come with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security, OK?"
34570,PS2,3,33.44,34.36,0.92,1.0,Creative idea.
34570,PS2,3,34.36,38.24,3.88,1.0,So that's something that hasn't already been exploited.
34570,PS2,3,38.44,38.68,0.24,1.0,Monkeys.
34570,PS2,3,44.16,44.96,0.8,3.0,Trained monkey.
34570,PS2,3,45.12,45.72,0.6,1.0,Trained monkey.
34570,PS2,3,46.0,46.76,0.76,2.0,Trained.
34570,PS2,3,47.48,48.36,0.88,3.0,Robots.
34570,PS2,3,48.68,49.4,0.72,2.0,Something you.
34570,PS2,3,50.72,51.72,1.0,3.0,Know if there's a block?
34570,PS2,3,52.0,58.76,6.76,2.0,"Like, OK, uncontrolled costs, which is obviously something they haven't foreseen, right?"
34570,PS2,3,59.68,68.32,8.64,2.0,Or inefficient delivery schedules.
34570,PS2,3,68.32,74.84,6.52,1.0,"What did they have, like, like a conveyor belt throughout and then you just keep dropping things as in when you get."
34570,PS2,3,74.84,75.12,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, well."
34570,PS2,3,75.16,80.08,4.92,2.0,Then how you get like a notification saying your your parcel is around your destination and then you go you.
34570,PS2,3,80.12,81.0,0.88,1.0,Have a sushi belt?
34570,PS2,3,83.08,83.2,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34570,PS2,3,83.72,84.48,0.76,1.0,"But yeah, obviously."
34570,PS2,3,85.44,89.16,3.72,2.0,But it's like tackle supply chain security doesn't sound secure.
34570,PS2,3,89.16,90.2,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, it's not secure at all."
34570,PS2,3,90.2,93.52,3.32,2.0,"But what if like you have you have to go like Amazon robots, right?"
34570,PS2,3,93.52,98.12,4.6,2.0,That they move around and then you have to go put in a PIN and then you get your parcel.
34570,PS2,3,98.12,100.04,1.92,2.0,But it's like in a body of a robot.
34570,PS2,3,100.92,102.12,1.2,2.0,So it's their mobile.
34570,PS2,3,102.64,105.2,2.56,2.0,They can be closer to where you are compared to.
34570,PS2,3,105.2,110.2,5.0,2.0,You have to be instead of you having to go to them and then you still put a code and then you open the.
34570,PS2,3,110.68,113.92,3.24,1.0,"Chest that already exists, but it's like static lockers."
34570,PS2,3,114.08,115.08,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, this is a mobile."
34570,PS2,3,115.28,116.0,0.72,2.0,Exactly.
34570,PS2,3,116.0,116.72,0.72,3.0,They have drone.
34570,PS2,3,117.76,118.24,0.48,2.0,Delivery do.
34570,PS2,3,118.84,120.84,2.0,3.0,They like like they have pizza.
34570,PS2,3,121.88,123.32,1.44,2.0,Drone delivery for pizza?
34570,PS2,3,123.72,124.48,0.76,2.0,Where so?
34570,PS2,3,125.12,127.88,2.76,3.0,Where the pizza place in Cambridge?
34570,PS2,3,127.92,128.4,0.48,3.0,Domino's.
34570,PS2,3,128.64,130.84,2.2,3.0,"Yeah, no, they yeah, they trial run."
34570,PS2,3,131.08,131.32,0.24,3.0,That's so.
34570,PS2,3,132.4,132.52,0.12,1.0,Cool.
34570,PS2,3,132.52,134.64,2.12,1.0,"No, I don't think it's raining Pizza, no."
34570,PS2,3,134.64,136.08,1.44,3.0,They do they have drone delivery.
34570,PS2,3,136.64,138.48,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, then we should start writing something."
34570,PS2,3,139.84,142.72,2.88,3.0,"But no, I mean that makes sense on like a larger scale."
34570,PS2,3,143.6,144.44,0.84,1.0,The which one?
34570,PS2,3,144.44,144.96,0.52,1.0,The robot?
34570,PS2,3,145.12,146.08,0.96,1.0,The drone delivery.
34570,PS2,3,146.16,153.24,7.08,2.0,"Yeah, drone delivery could work, but then how secure is it in terms of supply chain security like I could just."
34570,PS2,3,153.56,155.72,2.16,3.0,"Well, as long as there's like a code, you know."
34570,PS2,3,155.72,157.96,2.24,2.0,How would you or to unlock?
34570,PS2,3,157.96,159.36,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, like the same as that."
34570,PS2,3,159.36,159.88,0.52,3.0,A locker.
34570,PS2,3,160.32,165.2,4.88,1.0,"Yeah, You know, but the vulnerabilities you're talking about is just like costs and inefficient schedules."
34570,PS2,3,165.2,173.0,7.8,1.0,So the way I understand supply chain security is how do you make your supply chain robust enough so that you don't have uncontrolled costs and schedules?
34570,PS2,3,173.0,174.16,1.16,1.0,"That's not like, physically secure."
34570,PS2,3,175.0,175.2,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS2,3,176.08,179.68,3.6,3.0,"Well, you could try to have a better system to begin with."
34570,PS2,3,180.92,183.68,2.76,1.0,And the better system involves some form of robots.
34570,PS2,3,183.76,183.92,0.16,2.0,But.
34570,PS2,3,183.92,186.32,2.4,1.0,Humans are the ones which are inefficient.
34570,PS2,3,186.48,188.52,2.04,2.0,"Yeah, or like more prone to mistakes."
34570,PS2,3,188.52,190.04,1.52,1.0,"So, and I mean."
34570,PS2,3,190.04,190.4,0.36,2.0,One's.
34570,PS2,3,190.52,195.4,4.88,3.0,"Better data like collection of, you know, because there's like inefficient delivery."
34570,PS2,3,195.68,197.0,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, they're like analysis."
34570,PS2,3,197.0,197.84,0.84,2.0,Of yeah.
34570,PS2,3,198.16,201.6,3.44,3.0,"Your data and like, yeah, when there's blockages, yeah."
34570,PS2,3,202.08,205.32,3.24,1.0,"And I think another, I mean, this is not creative, but it's common sense."
34570,PS2,3,205.32,209.36,4.04,1.0,"Like just don't get it from the other side of the world, just make it."
34570,PS2,3,209.36,210.36,1.0,2.0,"As more local, yeah."
34570,PS2,3,210.36,210.44,0.08,2.0,As.
34570,PS2,3,210.44,211.96,1.52,1.0,"Much as possible, yeah."
34570,PS2,3,211.96,213.36,1.4,2.0,"That's so true, yeah."
34570,PS2,3,213.84,224.84,11.0,2.0,"So something with drone, something with like robots, like something with security where like a pass passcode has to go in and something more localized, right?"
34570,PS2,3,225.64,225.84,0.2,2.0,So.
34570,PS2,3,226.04,227.12,1.08,1.0,A localized.
34570,PS2,3,227.8,229.48,1.68,2.0,"Digitalized, Yeah."
34570,PS2,3,229.48,235.32,5.84,2.0,Localized digitalized drone delivery protected with passcode.
34570,PS2,3,235.64,236.96,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, right."
34570,PS2,3,237.16,237.28,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS2,3,237.28,239.68,2.4,2.0,Localized digitalized drone delivery.
34570,PS2,3,239.68,246.92,7.24,2.0,Delivery protected with car passwords protected.
34570,PS2,3,246.92,248.44,1.52,1.0,All monkeys in brackets.
34570,PS2,3,251.16,252.16,1.0,3.0,These are very smart.
34570,PS2,3,252.64,254.12,1.48,2.0,Oh my God.
34570,PS2,3,256.2,258.64,2.44,1.0,"You guys, they are smart, but they will."
34570,PS2,3,258.92,259.48,0.56,3.0,They're fickle.
34570,PS2,3,259.68,260.36,0.68,1.0,They're fickle.
34570,PS2,3,262.08,262.84,0.76,3.0,They will probably.
34570,PS2,3,262.96,263.52,0.56,2.0,Open up the.
34570,PS2,3,263.56,267.96,4.4,3.0,Food or or smart or shy?
34570,PS2,3,268.6,275.64,7.04,1.0,You know those ones like monkeys entered the resort we were in and they went straight for the tea and coffee place and they took the sugar packets.
34570,PS2,3,275.88,276.96,1.08,2.0,Why sugar packets so?
34570,PS2,3,277.68,278.16,0.48,1.0,They're smart.
34570,PS2,3,278.16,278.96,0.8,1.0,They're smart as functions.
34570,PS2,3,278.96,280.12,1.16,1.0,"Yeah, they like like glue."
34570,PS2,3,280.48,282.08,1.6,1.0,They ignored all the other stuff.
34570,PS2,3,282.16,282.6,0.44,2.0,And they?
34570,PS2,3,282.6,288.32,5.72,1.0,"Just took the sugar and they opened my friend's bag, took the snacks but didn't touch anything else and then they left."
34570,PS2,3,291.44,292.0,0.56,2.0,Alright.
34570,PS2,3,292.2,293.92,1.72,1.0,"Anyways, are we submitting?"
34570,PS2,3,294.2,296.12,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, Yeah, I think it's good."
34570,PS2,3,296.32,296.52,0.2,2.0,No.
34570,PS2,3,298.28,300.64,2.36,1.0,I feel like the monkeys we might need more explanations.
34570,PS2,3,302.16,302.88,0.72,2.0,And they one.
34570,PS2,3,302.92,303.6,0.68,3.0,Trained monkey.
34570,PS2,3,304.0,304.64,0.64,2.0,Trained.
34570,PS2,3,304.64,306.2,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, smart trained."
34570,PS2,3,306.4,306.68,0.28,3.0,Monkeys.
34570,PS2,3,314.04,314.48,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS2,3,315.12,317.52,2.4,3.0,And and better analytics.
34570,PS2,3,317.56,317.88,0.32,1.0,Oh yes.
34570,PS2,3,318.8,325.96,7.16,3.0,"Data analysis, but the AI will already have the data."
34570,PS2,3,326.6,327.64,1.04,3.0,I think it's still a good point.
34570,PS2,3,328.4,329.68,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, that's good."
34570,PS2,3,338.24,339.24,1.0,1.0,"Yes, that makes sense."
34570,PS2,3,339.24,339.92,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, that's good."
34570,PS2,3,340.52,340.96,0.44,2.0,Next.
35801,PS6,6,0.12,3.64,3.52,1.0,I was just thinking about what kind of resource can be included in.
35801,PS6,6,3.92,4.28,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS6,6,6.24,7.56,1.32,3.0,Idea instead of the details.
35801,PS6,6,7.76,8.84,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, implementation."
35801,PS6,6,8.88,10.16,1.28,4.0,"We can't go back, can we?"
35801,PS6,6,11.96,12.36,0.4,3.0,No help.
35801,PS6,6,13.36,15.76,2.4,2.0,There is no guideline on how detailed it has to be.
35801,PS6,6,15.76,17.56,1.8,2.0,So what's the?
35801,PS6,6,17.88,18.52,0.64,3.0,New resources idea.
35801,PS6,6,21.96,22.36,0.4,2.0,OK.
35801,PS6,6,32.52,38.28,5.76,2.0,"This is one of those things where like, you just need an influencer on Instagram to make it go viral and then everyone's going to do it."
35801,PS6,6,40.88,42.2,1.32,5.0,"No, I actually like the idea do."
35801,PS6,6,43.8,44.12,0.32,1.0,You want.
35801,PS6,6,44.12,44.28,0.16,3.0,To to.
35801,PS6,6,44.84,45.48,0.64,1.0,Sing in the shower.
35801,PS6,6,46.92,57.6,10.68,5.0,"Like because that is that's a trend like hashtag saying the shower I recalled, like recall the shop clue that once it goes through that virus."
35801,PS6,6,59.92,60.2,0.28,1.0,Recall.
35801,PS6,6,60.2,63.4,3.2,3.0,"Themselves singing in the shower room, yeah."
35801,PS6,6,75.15,76.15,1.0,2.0,Any other ideas you?
35801,PS6,6,78.91,81.87,2.96,5.0,Can't bring the law or like like a policy.
35801,PS6,6,84.43,88.31,3.88,2.0,That'd be really hard to just monitor and like.
35801,PS6,6,89.35,89.79,0.44,3.0,Maybe.
35801,PS6,6,90.27,98.2,7.93,1.0,Make some product that increase or make the shower room more private so we could sing in the shower room.
35801,PS6,6,99.52,103.12,3.6,1.0,Like your voice won't be heard by anyone right outside the.
35801,PS6,6,103.72,106.2,2.48,2.0,Like like a waterproof karaoke like.
35801,PS6,6,107.88,111.32,3.44,5.0,There's a marketing campaign that they do like a waterproof.
35801,PS6,6,112.68,116.12,3.44,5.0,They like waterproof for that.
35801,PS6,6,116.24,116.48,0.24,5.0,That could.
35801,PS6,6,116.6,122.64,6.04,1.0,Be used in some sunproof material and you attach it to the shower room wall so.
35801,PS6,6,124.28,124.76,0.48,3.0,If people.
35801,PS6,6,124.76,125.16,0.4,1.0,Know.
35801,PS6,6,125.16,125.4,0.24,3.0,They are.
35801,PS6,6,126.24,128.88,2.64,1.0,That voice won't be heard by anyone else.
35801,PS6,6,129.16,140.28,11.12,2.0,"So basically like a like a shower karaoke system that incorporates both soundproof and like the waterproof elements, Yeah."
35801,PS6,6,140.32,146.96,6.64,5.0,"And work with those influencers to promote this marketing, like their marketing campaign."
35801,PS6,6,146.96,150.2,3.24,5.0,"So we go with, yeah, also the products."
35801,PS6,6,152.92,157.24,4.32,4.0,Telling them you know that singing in the shower is good for health.
35801,PS6,6,157.6,159.04,1.44,4.0,"This will encourage them, right?"
35801,PS6,6,159.64,166.0,6.36,3.0,"But there are a lot of things that will, you know, benefit your health, but you will not just do it right."
35801,PS6,6,166.12,167.48,1.36,3.0,There are just thousands of things.
35801,PS6,6,167.68,169.24,1.56,3.0,"So yeah, you have to."
35801,PS6,6,169.52,170.0,0.48,4.0,Correct.
35801,PS6,6,170.0,176.48,6.48,4.0,"But this is a simple thing to do, you know, It's not a extreme diet or Yeah."
35801,PS6,6,176.92,177.28,0.36,3.0,I think.
35801,PS6,6,177.28,178.84,1.56,1.0,The key idea is it's simple.
35801,PS6,6,178.84,186.0,7.16,1.0,It's very easy to do without any stress or any like complicated process before doing it.
35801,PS6,6,186.56,190.48,3.92,2.0,"But also like singing for 20 minutes, like I don't think everyone's going to be up for that."
35801,PS6,6,190.48,194.88,4.4,2.0,"Like you need to convince them like a few minutes is fine, but 20 is a."
35801,PS6,6,195.36,196.24,0.88,2.0,Like you really have to.
35801,PS6,6,196.24,196.88,0.64,5.0,Convince someone.
35801,PS6,6,206.88,212.12,5.24,6.0,"Or just, you know, manufacture a lot that you need to be saying for 20 minutes before it can."
35801,PS6,6,212.12,212.88,0.76,3.0,Be unlocked.
35801,PS6,6,219.36,219.8,0.44,5.0,Wow.
35801,PS6,6,221.64,222.28,0.64,3.0,It's basically.
35801,PS6,6,222.28,222.8,0.52,6.0,A prison.
35801,PS6,6,222.88,223.8,0.92,6.0,"But you know, we can."
35801,PS6,6,223.84,224.2,0.36,3.0,Get out.
35801,PS6,6,224.44,226.72,2.28,2.0,I think that's beyond the point of encouraging them.
35801,PS6,6,226.84,227.64,0.8,2.0,That's just like.
35801,PS6,6,229.24,231.44,2.2,6.0,"I mean, you need to voluntarily buy them."
35801,PS6,6,231.8,232.24,0.44,6.0,You don't need.
35801,PS6,6,232.32,234.28,1.96,6.0,You know they're not installed by default.
35801,PS6,6,234.44,235.12,0.68,6.0,You need to buy them.
35801,PS6,6,235.36,235.92,0.56,5.0,But then.
35801,PS6,6,235.92,240.72,4.8,2.0,What incentive do people have to buy this very interesting product that locks you into your own shower?
35801,PS6,6,240.8,247.4,6.6,3.0,"It's very creative, but I don't think it will maximize the people, you know, doing this thing in the shower around can."
35801,PS6,6,248.12,254.24,6.12,1.0,We write multiple ideas and let the let them select one idea.
35801,PS6,6,254.24,255.56,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, but I guess here it's just."
35801,PS6,6,255.84,261.6,5.76,1.0,"It says one creative idea, but maybe we can write down several different ideas because we have so many."
35801,PS6,6,261.6,261.96,0.36,1.0,Excellent.
35801,PS6,6,263.28,269.28,6.0,2.0,"No, I think we can kind of just group them into like there's this one thing and it has these different elements, so like."
35801,PS6,6,269.92,270.8,0.88,1.0,One central.
35801,PS6,6,271.6,272.08,0.48,2.0,Idea.
35801,PS6,6,272.2,278.44,6.24,2.0,"Yeah, what are we calling it, the in shower karaoke system or something?"
35801,PS6,6,281.68,289.04,7.36,2.0,"OK, I'll just no, that's not what I wanted."
35801,PS6,6,295.36,296.96,1.6,2.0,How do you spell Karaoke K?
35801,PS6,6,297.76,297.8,0.04,3.0,A.
35801,PS6,6,298.96,303.44,4.48,2.0,RR like the is it AO or AOKA?
35801,PS6,6,304.04,309.6,5.56,5.0,RA I think it's KAR.
35801,PS6,6,311.12,311.96,0.84,2.0,AO does that look right?
35801,PS6,6,312.4,312.72,0.32,6.0,Yes.
35801,PS6,6,313.96,314.0,0.04,3.0,I.
35801,PS6,6,315.16,315.4,0.24,2.0,Think so?
35801,PS6,6,315.4,315.52,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS6,6,315.52,315.8,0.28,2.0,What's the?
35801,PS6,6,316.08,316.92,0.84,4.0,Code system.
35801,PS6,6,317.88,321.6,3.72,6.0,"It's a it's, it's kind of like, yeah, whatever."
35801,PS6,6,321.64,322.12,0.48,2.0,So there's something.
35801,PS6,6,322.16,323.08,0.92,3.0,Like that just.
35801,PS6,6,323.92,329.64,5.72,5.0,The same like the like background music.
35801,PS6,6,331.44,332.0,0.56,2.0,"Yeah, that."
35801,PS6,6,333.0,336.28,3.28,4.0,"Like in the pop, you know when they see they need."
35801,PS6,6,338.0,339.52,1.52,1.0,So maybe that's our title.
35801,PS6,6,339.88,340.32,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS6,6,340.32,341.32,1.0,1.0,Several pretty points.
35801,PS6,6,342.44,345.32,2.88,1.0,Like them for some sort of speakers.
35801,PS6,6,348.8,349.72,0.92,1.0,Waterproof speakers.
35801,PS6,6,354.16,355.52,1.36,2.0,Mic and speakers.
35801,PS6,6,360.56,361.88,1.32,4.0,That's another idea.
35801,PS6,6,362.64,366.2,3.56,1.0,I actually think we don't actually need a mic because.
35801,PS6,6,366.92,367.48,0.56,2.0,Fair enough.
35801,PS6,6,367.8,368.2,0.4,2.0,You're not.
35801,PS6,6,368.2,368.88,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, the whole."
35801,PS6,6,368.88,371.36,2.48,2.0,That defeats the whole purpose of wanting to be soundproof as well all.
35801,PS6,6,372.76,382.2,9.44,1.0,"I'm thinking is because the reason why people sing when when when I in the shower room, it's because it's like a very private room, right?"
35801,PS6,6,382.32,382.96,0.64,1.0,Private space.
35801,PS6,6,383.04,386.88,3.84,1.0,And also they're doing something that doesn't require.
35801,PS6,6,387.8,393.08,5.28,6.0,"Recording feature, like people might want lesson to be recorded to listen to it."
35801,PS6,6,393.08,394.16,1.08,6.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35801,PS6,6,394.2,396.0,1.8,6.0,Perform extremely well.
35801,PS6,6,396.0,402.92,6.92,2.0,"Or we could say waterproof speakers and other add-ons if people wish, such as a recording feature."
35801,PS6,6,407.08,409.36,2.28,1.0,People want their sound to be recorded.
35801,PS6,6,409.36,411.12,1.76,1.0,They want to do it in the.
35801,PS6,6,413.32,418.56,5.24,2.0,Power room materials to make their shower soundproof.
35801,PS6,6,421.92,423.2,1.28,2.0,I don't know what else to say.
35801,PS6,6,423.68,426.36,2.68,2.0,How else could you describe the soundproofness?
35801,PS6,6,426.96,427.92,0.96,6.0,Do you need a timer?
35801,PS6,6,427.96,429.64,1.68,6.0,Because it says over 20 minutes.
35801,PS6,6,429.72,430.96,1.24,6.0,People need to know how.
35801,PS6,6,430.96,434.8,3.84,2.0,Long the.
35801,PS6,6,447.2,447.56,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS6,6,449.52,449.64,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35801,PS6,6,449.64,462.52,12.88,1.0,And I guess maybe a very easy to use speaker because I think maybe if you have a speaker that can play music that can be very.
35801,PS6,6,463.64,464.04,0.4,4.0,Useful.
35801,PS6,6,464.52,467.32,2.8,1.0,But people don't want it to be very complicated.
35801,PS6,6,467.32,471.8,4.48,1.0,"Yeah, maybe they can spend 5 seconds before and then the shower room."
35801,PS6,6,472.44,475.0,2.56,2.0,"Yeah, right."
35801,PS6,6,475.0,483.8,8.8,2.0,So I can just add a sentence where all this system should be easy to use.
35801,PS6,6,484.28,484.44,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
35801,PS6,6,489.96,492.24,2.28,3.0,Should you also add the point of influencer?
35801,PS6,6,495.12,496.12,1.0,1.0,Maybe a very.
35801,PS6,6,497.28,512.6,15.32,2.0,"Yeah, and can be through and."
35801,PS6,6,513.48,517.24,3.76,1.0,"This is kind of like a second point, so maybe make it another progress."
35801,PS6,6,517.48,517.92,0.44,2.0,OK.
35801,PS6,6,522.2,523.0,0.8,1.0,The social media part.
35801,PS6,6,524.0,524.4,0.4,2.0,OK.
35801,PS6,6,532.16,532.96,0.8,2.0,What can I say?
35801,PS6,6,561.89,564.93,3.04,3.0,"Yeah, I."
35801,PS6,6,565.61,570.69,5.08,2.0,Want to like pause before I click next in case anyone wants to think about it.
35801,PS6,6,570.69,571.29,0.6,2.0,Add anything.
35801,PS6,6,571.29,573.4,2.11,2.0,"We still have two minutes, two and a."
35801,PS6,6,579.96,580.28,0.32,5.0,Half months.
34391,PS5,6,0.0,1013.2,4.76,5.0,"A anonymous attrition happens when an employer decides to leave the company, resulting in the reduction of value of talent."
34391,PS5,6,1013.48,1017.8,4.32,5.0,Please come to stop voluntary employed tradition increase salary.
34391,PS5,6,1018.32,1019.36,1.04,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34391,PS5,6,1021.12,1022.04,0.92,6.0,That is creative.
34391,PS5,6,1022.04,1022.2,0.16,6.0,That's.
34391,PS5,6,1022.32,1023.16,0.84,3.0,"What our minds, I mean."
34391,PS5,6,1025.04,1026.4,1.36,1.0,This the part 10.
34391,PS5,6,1027.8,1028.28,0.48,3.0,Is anyone?
34391,PS5,6,1028.28,1035.0,6.72,3.0,Voluntary attrition happens when an employee decides to leave the company resulting in the reduction of value talent in the workers.
34391,PS5,6,1035.0,1038.36,3.36,3.0,Please come up with one creative idea to stop voluntary employee attrition.
34391,PS5,6,1038.68,1040.32,1.64,5.0,By the company employees are going to.
34391,PS5,6,1041.08,1041.32,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34391,PS5,6,1041.76,1043.16,1.4,5.0,They still remain in your company.
34391,PS5,6,1045.96,1046.84,0.88,2.0,SO11.
34391,PS5,6,1047.8,1048.52,0.72,5.0,"Yeah, quitting."
34391,PS5,6,1049.48,1062.44,12.96,2.0,"One could be like they get demotivated because of they could be demotivated due to multiple reasons, for example, maybe the scope of future growth, or they don't understand how they they see themselves in the company."
34391,PS5,6,1062.44,1083.24,20.8,2.0,"So some kind of mentor from the company, from higher positions which, which, which engage with them regularly to, to, to clarify whatever their, they, they, I mean, so, so just to have an interaction with them and mentor them whenever they need."
34391,PS5,6,1084.64,1088.48,3.84,3.0,Like a mentorship program to kind of keep people engaged in the.
34391,PS5,6,1090.12,1093.0,2.88,2.0,Mentorship program within the organization Try.
34391,PS5,6,1094.8,1096.24,1.44,3.0,To think of something creative here.
34391,PS5,6,1098.32,1112.64,14.32,4.0,"It's not going to stop the attrition, but but maybe it can delay like in terms of said the benefits that they're receiving in terms of some pension or like a a better loan for the car."
34391,PS5,6,1113.0,1119.08,6.08,4.0,They can only use it if they would spend three or five or seven years in the organization and if they.
34391,PS5,6,1119.12,1119.92,0.8,1.0,Would leave.
34391,PS5,6,1120.24,1123.8,3.56,4.0,And do voluntary attrition before that they won't be there's.
34391,PS5,6,1123.8,1124.8,1.0,5.0,Something like the ESOP?
34391,PS5,6,1125.44,1133.64,8.2,2.0,"So these are already being practiced in lots of places like the wands and Esops, or they get vested when you stay for a certain number of."
34391,PS5,6,1134.08,1134.72,0.64,5.0,Bonuses that have.
34391,PS5,6,1135.04,1135.24,0.2,6.0,Given.
34391,PS5,6,1135.64,1135.76,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34391,PS5,6,1136.4,1148.24,11.84,3.0,Giving them these these benefits and even better but if they want to voluntarily leave it can make them pay you like a year of salary that would avoid people from.
34391,PS5,6,1148.6,1150.36,1.76,4.0,I see who's on the capitalistic side.
34391,PS5,6,1152.32,1153.4,1.08,3.0,"I mean, it's a, it's a creative."
34391,PS5,6,1154.96,1155.28,0.32,4.0,"Idea, right?"
34391,PS5,6,1155.28,1155.8,0.52,4.0,But nobody.
34391,PS5,6,1156.0,1157.72,1.72,4.0,But then nobody would join the company.
34391,PS5,6,1158.28,1159.32,1.04,1.0,Because it's such a bad.
34391,PS5,6,1159.44,1159.68,0.24,3.0,Idea.
34391,PS5,6,1161.16,1165.64,4.48,3.0,I mean the benefits when you can be so good that you would want to go.
34391,PS5,6,1166.84,1168.84,2.0,6.0,You will be forced to be there for forever.
34391,PS5,6,1168.84,1171.48,2.64,5.0,Why don't you just give that benefit for them to stay on?
34391,PS5,6,1171.48,1172.24,0.76,4.0,"Longer Yeah, I."
34391,PS5,6,1173.6,1183.32,9.72,5.0,"Mean you're basically, you're basically increasing that regular benefits and then being like give me my money back if you leave yeah and give them that much money then."
34391,PS5,6,1184.56,1184.8,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34391,PS5,6,1184.8,1185.04,0.24,2.0,Wait.
34391,PS5,6,1185.04,1200.4,15.36,2.0,"Some, like lot of companies, maybe the big companies do this analysis, but a lot of like smaller companies, they don't do like they don't, they let the people leave if they increase, if they ask for like raise that they might deserve but you are not willing to give."
34391,PS5,6,1200.8,1207.68,6.88,2.0,"But then you'll spend your resources in hiring new people and training them, which is often even more so."
34391,PS5,6,1208.24,1218.84,10.6,2.0,"If companies have this kind of more awareness towards this, then I think they would be more willing to encourage their employees to stay by giving them more."
34391,PS5,6,1218.96,1226.16,7.2,3.0,"Financially, your time, yeah, I don't know how to do you know how to remove."
34391,PS5,6,1226.56,1226.68,0.12,2.0,This.
34391,PS5,6,1226.72,1227.16,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34391,PS5,6,1228.08,1231.2,3.12,1.0,"Yeah, Shift, you just click Shift."
34391,PS5,6,1234.56,1235.96,1.4,2.0,I learned this in the previous session that.
34391,PS5,6,1235.96,1236.52,0.56,3.0,That that.
34391,PS5,6,1236.52,1238.2,1.68,3.0,That happened to me too.
34391,PS5,6,1238.2,1238.84,0.64,3.0,That happened to me too.
34391,PS5,6,1238.84,1239.28,0.44,1.0,Girl is.
34391,PS5,6,1241.2,1241.56,0.36,3.0,A is a.
34391,PS5,6,1242.44,1243.08,0.64,6.0,"Chinese story, yeah, yeah."
34391,PS5,6,1243.08,1255.04,11.96,6.0,But seeing I think we should create like a metric or how much value an employer given the years of experience and based on that give them a recompensation package.
34391,PS5,6,1255.2,1265.2,10.0,6.0,"If they want to leave, they say don't leave, we will give you this and if you stay with us more years you will have more of this package giving your value add to the company."
34391,PS5,6,1266.52,1266.6,0.08,4.0,You.
34391,PS5,6,1271.32,1284.24,12.92,3.0,"Have something creative, This one is hard."
34391,PS5,6,1286.36,1286.68,0.32,6.0,People.
34391,PS5,6,1287.72,1288.12,0.4,3.0,I mean.
34391,PS5,6,1288.32,1290.72,2.4,1.0,Either with money or with stock.
34391,PS5,6,1291.28,1305.96,14.68,2.0,"Or create a program of like skill development, like regular, so that the person also develops like professionally in in some way in a gradual manner."
34391,PS5,6,1305.96,1311.24,5.28,2.0,"If they stay with you, they might find more value in staying in your corporation."
34391,PS5,6,1311.24,1313.52,2.28,3.0,"Yeah, like sentiment to a course to Cambridge or something."
34391,PS5,6,1313.68,1314.6,0.92,2.0,"Like that, Yeah, yeah."
34391,PS5,6,1314.6,1316.72,2.12,2.0,Or give those kind of opportunities to them.
34391,PS5,6,1317.52,1319.2,1.68,3.0,That's also a good idea to say.
34391,PS5,6,1319.96,1337.84,17.88,6.0,"I think what if this question is more relate to older people of people with 65, because the the question say a reduction of value target in the workforce, it's not necessary that they move to a job, it's basically that they retire sooner."
34391,PS5,6,1340.92,1341.84,0.92,6.0,I think the catch.
34391,PS5,6,1342.24,1343.8,1.56,2.0,"No, it's not about retiring."
34391,PS5,6,1343.8,1345.52,1.72,2.0,It's basically about leaving the company.
34391,PS5,6,1346.08,1354.24,8.16,2.0,"It could be retiring as well, but it's just basically any employee who leaves the company they're and they are switching basically."
34391,PS5,6,1354.32,1360.8,6.48,6.0,"Yes, yes, no, but because of the work, the workforce, the workforce could be from the company or the entire country."
34391,PS5,6,1361.0,1366.84,5.84,6.0,"For example, what happened is you have 10 employees who wants to retire at 55 and still working."
34391,PS5,6,1367.16,1372.56,5.4,6.0,This will reduce the volume talent of the entire I know country but.
34391,PS5,6,1373.76,1377.32,3.56,2.0,"I mean, if the retirement age is increased then."
34391,PS5,6,1378.88,1380.56,1.68,4.0,"But it's still, it's still voluntary."
34391,PS5,6,1380.84,1381.0,0.16,3.0,So.
34391,PS5,6,1381.36,1385.08,3.72,4.0,It doesn't doesn't have to do anything with the age then they're leaving themselves.
34391,PS5,6,1386.88,1387.8,0.92,4.0,But understand your point.
34391,PS5,6,1387.8,1388.36,0.56,4.0,"Yeah, it's it."
34391,PS5,6,1388.76,1389.52,0.76,4.0,It could be.
34391,PS5,6,1391.96,1397.84,5.88,6.0,Maybe some government programs to enforce people to donate their knowledge?
34391,PS5,6,1398.64,1402.36,3.72,6.0,Like create this no educational videos.
34391,PS5,6,1402.76,1411.84,9.08,6.0,"If you are going to retire or you're going to leave your work, you need to create some videos to to save your knowledge, to share your knowledge with other people."
34391,PS5,6,1412.48,1421.04,8.56,6.0,"So in that case, if you want to know about some job, you can, you can hear from experienced people who worked like 20 years."

34391,PS5,6,1424.48,1431.24,6.76,6.0,You have this testimonial videos of people who let companies and they can share this information.
34391,PS5,6,1432.2,1439.2,7.0,3.0,"And, and building on that, maybe like governments could, again, you need some help from regulation here."
34391,PS5,6,1439.6,1446.08,6.48,3.0,"Governments put quick pull like a minimum time you have to stay in the company after you resign, let's say a month."
34391,PS5,6,1446.48,1452.56,6.08,3.0,"That gives enough time for you to, you know, pass the knowledge to the person that it's going to replace you."
34391,PS5,6,1453.08,1454.96,1.88,3.0,And that way you can reduce the you know.
34391,PS5,6,1456.52,1457.92,1.4,2.0,But why government like?
34391,PS5,6,1458.04,1459.08,1.04,4.0,"Because yeah, I."
34391,PS5,6,1459.12,1459.88,0.76,3.0,Told the development.

34391,PS5,6,1462.16,1465.44,3.28,2.0,"Press like they can make some labour laws regarding that, but yeah."
34391,PS5,6,1465.52,1472.24,6.72,4.0,"But they cannot make anybody stay at a company, and even the companies cannot make anybody stay I."
34391,PS5,6,1472.24,1472.6,0.36,3.0,Mean by?
34391,PS5,6,1472.8,1474.04,1.24,2.0,Company can enforce.
34391,PS5,6,1474.96,1475.72,0.76,3.0,Labour regulation.
34391,PS5,6,1475.92,1478.08,2.16,2.0,Company can provide a contract well.
34391,PS5,6,1478.12,1480.84,2.72,5.0,The companies become very dictatorial and people.
34391,PS5,6,1480.88,1481.08,0.2,6.0,Are not.
34391,PS5,6,1482.12,1488.64,6.52,5.0,If if as a person I knew I cannot leave a company for two years and I get a stupid manager on the first day.
34391,PS5,6,1490.36,1491.24,0.88,3.0,That's why.
34391,PS5,6,1493.4,1497.72,4.32,2.0,"I think the companies can enforce this kind of contract and then they have the transition, but the company."
34391,PS5,6,1498.48,1499.72,1.24,5.0,Already had yeah right.
34391,PS5,6,1499.76,1501.2,1.44,5.0,It's called the notice.
34391,PS5,6,1501.2,1502.56,1.36,5.0,You have to give a notice.
34391,PS5,6,1502.96,1505.04,2.08,5.0,Is proportional to how senior you are.
34391,PS5,6,1505.04,1509.24,4.2,5.0,So see you as a six month notice and analyst would have a one month but then.
34391,PS5,6,1509.24,1515.92,6.68,4.0,You can still still but the but right now the companies don't cannot push you like you're not legally binding.
34391,PS5,6,1515.92,1519.16,3.24,3.0,"To spend more about saying right, yeah, you're saying it is."
34391,PS5,6,1519.24,1520.48,1.24,4.0,Being legally binding.
34391,PS5,6,1520.48,1523.04,2.56,5.0,But that is not stopping the employer from leaving it.
34391,PS5,6,1523.12,1524.68,1.56,2.0,Is basically to facilitate the.
34391,PS5,6,1526.16,1527.68,1.52,5.0,But we have not let them.
34391,PS5,6,1528.16,1528.56,0.4,3.0,Have to stop.
34391,PS5,6,1531.68,1532.52,0.84,1.0,How about a deal?
34391,PS5,6,1532.68,1534.12,1.44,2.0,Actually you are what you are saying.
34391,PS5,6,1534.12,1539.64,5.52,2.0,I think it's it is facilitating leaving smoothly I think maybe in a way.
34391,PS5,6,1539.64,1540.12,0.48,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34391,PS5,6,1540.36,1544.04,3.68,3.0,"Again, it's, it's not avoiding people living."

34391,PS5,6,1545.64,1557.92,12.28,1.0,"Yeah, just if it's me, I want to create a small team to professionally deal with the people who want to leave and to know the exact reason why they want to leave."
34391,PS5,6,1557.92,1563.56,5.64,1.0,"Some people maybe because of the money, some people maybe because they don't like their boss."
34391,PS5,6,1564.04,1567.2,3.16,1.0,So they have people have various reasons.
34391,PS5,6,1567.64,1572.16,4.52,1.0,So to know the reason and to tackle the reason is the most important thing to.
34391,PS5,6,1572.92,1575.4,2.48,2.0,"Yeah, I think that's a very good point."
34391,PS5,6,1575.4,1581.0,5.6,2.0,Like there should be some kind of survey or some assessment or some interaction with the leaving employee even if they leave.
34391,PS5,6,1581.0,1585.48,4.48,2.0,Like we should know what are the reasons so that we can improve or work on them.
34391,PS5,6,1589.28,1604.2,14.92,1.0,"So a team focus on this thing can do it more professionally and combine with some emotional elements into it to reflect how, how how many happy hour, how how many happy moments they have spent in this company."

35126,PS5,3,59.52,66.72,7.2,3.0,"So companies started to listen them so they can bring their cats or dogs, whatever they want to bring."
35126,PS5,3,67.4,74.48,7.08,3.0,So kind of providing them very good environment for them to work at.

35126,PS5,3,91.68,96.56,4.88,2.0,So somebody would just play music in a library so we could just go and take rest for some time.
35126,PS5,3,97.16,99.72,2.56,3.0,I think I saw one photo actually.
35126,PS5,3,99.92,100.76,0.84,3.0,I think so.
35126,PS5,3,100.8,104.52,3.72,3.0,Each meeting room is shared with a house so you can actually leave.
35126,PS5,3,104.88,106.96,2.08,3.0,I mean have the office your own.
35126,PS5,3,107.12,111.48,4.36,3.0,So each one leaves different house in the company because it was really cool.
35126,PS5,3,112.76,117.4,4.64,2.0,"But I don't know if that will attract people to not leave the company, right?"
35126,PS5,3,117.68,119.64,1.96,2.0,"I mean, we had a living room, but I didn't know."
35126,PS5,3,121.32,123.36,2.04,3.0,"No, I mean it's like your second home."
35126,PS5,3,123.72,124.2,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
35126,PS5,3,124.28,124.96,0.68,2.0,Coming home.
35126,PS5,3,125.48,132.56,7.08,1.0,"I mean, if the company gives you accommodation, you're much less likely to leave it because there's a huge cost in actually."
35126,PS5,3,132.88,141.6,8.72,2.0,"Moving this also, my company used to do at one point they used to provide accommodation and Mumbai like cost of accommodation is extremely high."
35126,PS5,3,142.04,143.68,1.64,1.0,Should we should we stick back then?
35126,PS5,3,143.96,144.6,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, I think."
35126,PS5,3,146.48,152.04,5.56,1.0,"I know like in like my dad or for Emirates like we, we have company accommodation, so they, they pay for a house for us."
35126,PS5,3,152.04,158.12,6.08,1.0,"But it's like, yeah, if we we've been in the house for 19 years now, if we want to move, if we leave the company, we have to leave the house in three months."
35126,PS5,3,159.08,163.84,4.76,2.0,"Even in India a lot of banks do that, then a lot of public sector companies also."
35126,PS5,3,164.88,165.32,0.44,2.0,I think that's.
35126,PS5,3,176.92,178.4,1.48,3.0,The quality is not good enough.
35126,PS5,3,178.4,180.12,1.72,3.0,Are you still staying in that?
35126,PS5,3,180.12,183.44,3.32,1.0,"Company no like you, I think the quality is definitely should definitely important."
35126,PS5,3,183.64,187.84,4.2,1.0,Should we mention that they gave us no constraint on cost so.
35126,PS5,3,220.04,221.08,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, that's how it works for them."
35126,PS5,3,221.2,226.48,5.28,1.0,"You have to like as soon as you give your notice, you have to leave within three months, which is a bit of a sum cost."
35126,PS5,3,226.52,230.6,4.08,1.0,Like you don't want to leave happy with that.
34293,PS2,3,4.08,28.16,24.08,1.0,OK to uncontrolled causing inefficient delivery schedules.
34293,PS2,3,29.6,33.24,3.64,1.0,I have one creative idea to tackle supply chain security.
34293,PS2,3,36.28,37.4,1.12,2.0,Identify the bottle.
34293,PS2,3,38.8,40.24,1.44,3.0,"OK, this is the operation management."
34293,PS2,3,43.4,44.36,0.96,3.0,This is not an example.
34293,PS2,3,44.36,45.08,0.72,3.0,What do you think?
34293,PS2,3,53.72,54.68,0.96,1.0,I think it could.
34293,PS2,3,54.68,54.96,0.28,2.0,Yes.
34293,PS2,3,56.84,65.88,9.04,3.0,"I think first that we need to know the problems like the scope, I don't know, it's like the vulnerability in what the raw materials or."
34293,PS2,3,66.12,68.28,2.16,2.0,"Like in what aspect of the supply chain, Right, Yeah."
34293,PS2,3,68.76,71.36,2.6,2.0,So he's identifying where the vulnerability is first.
34293,PS2,3,72.36,73.12,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, I think."
34293,PS2,3,73.12,73.84,0.72,2.0,We can't tackle it.
34293,PS2,3,74.36,85.56,11.2,3.0,Instructions like in the raw material in the process or in the delivery of the finished good to the to the customers kind of not clear.
34293,PS2,3,85.8,87.08,1.28,3.0,"How about you guys, what do you think?"
34293,PS2,3,87.08,88.04,0.96,3.0,What's your take on that?
34293,PS2,3,89.08,90.68,1.6,3.0,You clear with the statement first?
34293,PS2,3,90.68,92.04,1.36,3.0,"Like for nobody with reading, Yeah."
34293,PS2,3,92.8,95.24,2.44,2.0,I I think the statement is clear.
34293,PS2,3,97.68,106.48,8.8,2.0,"I would try to, I guess me go step by step across the supply chain and look at if everything is running optimally at their specific step."
34293,PS2,3,107.32,112.64,5.32,2.0,And then that way we can identify the vulnerabilities and then try to solve from there.
34293,PS2,3,112.84,115.68,2.84,2.0,"But like, if we don't know what the vulnerability is, we can't really solve, yeah."
34293,PS2,3,116.76,119.76,3.0,3.0,"Let's make assumption, perhaps like raw materials."
34293,PS2,3,120.16,124.64,4.48,1.0,"Because like a transportation or raw material, we start from the start."
34293,PS2,3,124.64,131.48,6.84,1.0,"So raw materials first, then maybe it could be like, I'm not sure of course."
34293,PS2,3,132.68,141.36,8.68,3.0,"Inconsistency of the quality, perhaps the raw materials, but I'm thinking of the supply itself, the supply shock because of."
34293,PS2,3,141.76,147.04,5.28,2.0,"The machine that is conversing the raw materials to finish products, that's slow."
34293,PS2,3,147.08,147.52,0.44,3.0,Or something.
34293,PS2,3,147.92,148.12,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,148.72,160.92,12.2,1.0,"It could be like a social thing because maybe like the workers in the country, maybe they have some issues like I think there was, I think like, you know, those kind of like the building collapse in those really good."
34293,PS2,3,161.36,161.68,0.32,2.0,That's true.
34293,PS2,3,161.68,162.32,0.64,2.0,That's true.
34293,PS2,3,162.32,163.6,1.28,1.0,Locations for my fashion.
34293,PS2,3,171.72,172.0,0.28,3.0,OK.
34293,PS2,3,172.12,173.44,1.32,3.0,There you go.
34293,PS2,3,173.48,173.6,0.12,3.0,Back.
34293,PS2,3,173.6,174.4,0.8,3.0,If I change.
34293,PS2,3,175.04,176.4,1.36,3.0,So OK.
34293,PS2,3,177.96,188.4,10.44,3.0,"And what kind of OK in that aspect, what kind of solutions do you think would tackle the problems pertaining to, you know, the raw materials?"
34293,PS2,3,188.44,188.68,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,188.68,189.72,1.04,2.0,"We could do, we could."
34293,PS2,3,189.72,200.24,10.52,2.0,"The solution could maybe not be very specific, but we could come up with a like a checklist of things that you should check and then whatever isn't working out."
34293,PS2,3,200.24,202.76,2.52,2.0,Maybe that's how you can call a solution.
34293,PS2,3,202.76,205.0,2.24,2.0,So something that would work across the board.
34293,PS2,3,206.04,214.72,8.68,2.0,"So kind of like I explained personally, no, but seeing is it me asking specific questions."
34293,PS2,3,214.72,219.12,4.4,2.0,"So is, is this particular process running optimally?"
34293,PS2,3,219.12,224.48,5.36,2.0,What is optimal for this specific process and what kind of things?
34293,PS2,3,224.48,231.04,6.56,2.0,"So if they're, if you're able to answer those questions, I think you'll be able to fix the problem."
34293,PS2,3,231.04,231.6,0.56,2.0,Do you know what I mean?
34293,PS2,3,232.96,243.08,10.12,2.0,Because we don't actually know and the answer will be different depending on what the like what exactly it is that we're looking at.
34293,PS2,3,243.08,245.88,2.8,2.0,"So if it's a car manufacturing, it would be different from each office factory."
34293,PS2,3,245.96,246.44,0.48,3.0,Like.
34293,PS2,3,247.8,255.84,8.04,2.0,"So we need to, I guess, ask some broad questions, ask a solution."
34293,PS2,3,256.64,261.04,4.4,1.0,I think I did hear like there is one way that people do is like they have like a risk.
34293,PS2,3,261.52,261.88,0.36,2.0,A risk?
34293,PS2,3,263.36,270.36,7.0,1.0,"So they kind of take like many different, how do I say like like whatever could happen."
34293,PS2,3,270.36,277.08,6.72,1.0,They try to like have a few options for the different suppliers and then they can actually calculate out the final risk based on that.
34293,PS2,3,277.08,279.24,2.16,1.0,So they like create like kind of like a bubble map.
34293,PS2,3,280.32,285.2,4.88,1.0,Then in the end they calculate down to to track their resource across all industries I think.
34293,PS2,3,285.44,286.6,1.16,3.0,Supplier resilience.
34293,PS2,3,286.6,287.16,0.56,2.0,I think right.
34293,PS2,3,287.32,288.68,1.36,3.0,Supplier resilience.
34293,PS2,3,288.68,292.12,3.44,1.0,"Maybe they mean something like that kind of thing, Like it's more like concept."
34293,PS2,3,292.68,293.44,0.76,2.0,I think so too.
34293,PS2,3,293.48,300.04,6.56,2.0,I think it's more concept rather than specific because we can come up with them with an idea right now.
34293,PS2,3,300.08,300.92,0.84,2.0,Any solution?
34293,PS2,3,301.2,302.0,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, they might not."
34293,PS2,3,302.0,306.64,4.64,2.0,It might not be logical for the actual supply chain that they may be thinking about.
34293,PS2,3,306.84,314.04,7.2,2.0,So I think the bubble makes sense because that can be used for literally any any problem.
34293,PS2,3,314.28,314.64,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,315.04,320.32,5.28,1.0,And then like within each supplier if you not can map them to like a risk profile.
34293,PS2,3,320.56,332.6,12.04,1.0,"But I've also heard of those kind of innovations where they try to like track like whatever goes on the web, then they try to find like keywords that could indicate that a potential disaster might happen, like COVID kind of disaster."
34293,PS2,3,332.72,335.04,2.32,2.0,"That's the risk profile that you're talking about, right?"
34293,PS2,3,335.04,335.28,0.24,2.0,That's.
34293,PS2,3,335.32,335.6,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,335.6,339.44,3.84,1.0,"So then they can determine, OK, this country is like likely to have a risk."
34293,PS2,3,339.44,342.4,2.96,1.0,And then they try to map that into their supply chain.
34293,PS2,3,342.4,350.44,8.04,1.0,"There are people who do things like that, but I'm not sure how effective or whether we can come up with something more creative than yeah."
34293,PS2,3,351.2,352.56,1.36,2.0,"I think a risk, I'm so sorry."
34293,PS2,3,352.56,359.76,7.2,2.0,I think a risk profile that's each stage of the process would be helpful to just like outline the issue.
34293,PS2,3,360.0,371.04,11.04,2.0,"And like with the risk profile, you'll be able to actually answer the question or like actually like solve the problem for that specific like part of the supply chain."
34293,PS2,3,373.52,374.32,0.8,2.0,So how are you say?
34293,PS2,3,374.36,374.76,0.4,2.0,I'm so sorry.
34293,PS2,3,375.0,380.88,5.88,3.0,"No problem, I'm just thinking maybe perhaps using the AII know AI is overly used, no?"
34293,PS2,3,380.92,382.6,1.68,2.0,"But here we are, so use it."
34293,PS2,3,383.68,397.44,13.76,3.0,"Basically together real time data, so we can, you know, kind of monitors if there's any kind of differences, let's say in in terms of the supply raw materials, they're like sudden drop and they can like predictive models."
34293,PS2,3,397.56,405.16,7.6,3.0,"So they can do a pre emptive actions if you know certain patterns, let's say you know deviates from the normal 1."
34293,PS2,3,405.4,410.28,4.88,3.0,"So they can start to be more, you know, aware of those kind of changes, I would say, I think."
34293,PS2,3,410.68,411.04,0.36,2.0,That works.
34293,PS2,3,411.04,426.72,15.68,2.0,"So like, just like, like, you know what you just said, you could use AI to create a model of how it would work ideally and then create a risk profile for each step of the like, for each step."
34293,PS2,3,426.76,436.12,9.36,2.0,"And then I guess how we would be able to either solve or like just make things a bit easier, like not, sorry, solve the problem for each step if something goes wrong."
34293,PS2,3,436.48,442.32,5.84,2.0,"And because we're using AI, it will be expensive and they'll be able to create more than we expected."
34293,PS2,3,442.32,442.44,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,443.6,453.72,10.12,3.0,"For instance in this case if the raw material increased like for the next like let's say two months, they can buy it now exactly like the cost is kind of lowered their."
34293,PS2,3,453.72,457.12,3.4,2.0,Forecasting I have a question this 4 minutes.
34293,PS2,3,457.12,460.04,2.92,2.0,Is this for this question alone or for the whole thing I think.
34293,PS2,3,460.56,461.96,1.4,1.0,Every task is 12 minutes.
34293,PS2,3,462.0,462.64,0.64,2.0,12 minutes at.
34293,PS2,3,462.72,463.4,0.68,1.0,Least a few tasks.
34293,PS2,3,466.36,466.48,0.12,3.0,OK.
34293,PS2,3,466.48,467.84,1.36,3.0,I mean AI modeling of.
34293,PS2,3,469.44,471.84,2.4,2.0,"The entire supply chain process, yeah."
34293,PS2,3,472.56,474.68,2.12,3.0,For the entire sorry.
34293,PS2,3,474.76,477.68,2.92,2.0,"Yeah, for this entire supply chain."
34293,PS2,3,479.32,480.24,0.92,3.0,"After the AI, no."
34293,PS2,3,480.24,481.32,1.08,2.0,So AI modeling.
34293,PS2,3,481.76,483.68,1.92,3.0,For OK for the entire.
34293,PS2,3,483.68,484.48,0.8,2.0,Supply chain.
34293,PS2,3,485.04,487.2,2.16,3.0,So I chain process OK.
34293,PS2,3,490.04,493.64,3.6,2.0,And then risk assessments for each step of the supply chain.
34293,PS2,3,497.84,499.24,1.4,1.0,So what would the AI do?
34293,PS2,3,499.68,501.44,1.76,2.0,"So the AI creates, OK, that's great."
34293,PS2,3,501.44,508.44,7.0,2.0,I I'm thinking it creates a perfect model like it creates a perfect supply chain of how things will run in an ideal situation.
34293,PS2,3,509.32,510.76,1.44,2.0,That's what the AI does at 1st.
34293,PS2,3,511.04,529.52,18.48,2.0,"And then the risk profile that you were talking about looks like each, each set, each so each step in the supply chain and says, these are all the things that could possibly go wrong and you can map out to as a result, this could happen and this could mess up the next, the next step or all of that."
34293,PS2,3,529.52,532.84,3.32,2.0,And you're able to see all of that.
34293,PS2,3,532.84,536.84,4.0,2.0,"And then when they say something goes wrong, you're, you can easily say, OK, this is red."
34293,PS2,3,536.84,539.36,2.52,2.0,"And because this is red, this is causing all these issues."
34293,PS2,3,541.0,545.04,4.04,2.0,I think that's how and I think that model will work for actually anything.
34293,PS2,3,546.56,548.84,2.28,3.0,"Right, it's like a generic concepts."
34293,PS2,3,549.28,549.52,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,552.96,553.08,0.12,3.0,And.
34293,PS2,3,553.56,557.6,4.04,1.0,Then in like one side problem then they can cough the infected.
34293,PS2,3,557.84,558.88,1.04,2.0,ARM exit.
34293,PS2,3,564.0,564.12,0.12,1.0,Any.
34293,PS2,3,567.84,569.36,1.52,3.0,Other stuff.
34293,PS2,3,569.56,572.92,3.36,2.0,"I don't know if you should say dude, like write this morning step by step."
34293,PS2,3,574.04,577.12,3.08,3.0,"Sorry, sorry."
34293,PS2,3,583.28,584.0,0.72,2.0,OK.
34293,PS2,3,584.0,585.24,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, I'm out in supply chain."
34293,PS2,3,585.24,587.0,1.76,2.0,"No, I'll pass and versus?"
34293,PS2,3,600.28,612.24,11.96,1.0,I also wonder if there is something that we can do about like contracts because it's like a lot of the the things is like you're tied up to like be contracted to like these suppliers.
34293,PS2,3,612.6,620.52,7.92,1.0,"So whenever there is an issue, then you're just kind of stuck with those suppliers and all the suppliers one that one that assurance."
34293,PS2,3,620.52,626.08,5.56,1.0,So they have this they only like like they sign on to like the same people.
34293,PS2,3,626.4,641.64,15.24,1.0,"Whereas if they could have an option of purchasing from the market also, then that could tide them over for the difficult parts when they have trouble."
34293,PS2,3,641.96,656.72,14.76,1.0,And then I wonder if like suppliers normally have like a spare capacity and then maybe that capacity could could be commoditized together into a market for existing suppliers.
34293,PS2,3,656.72,672.56,15.84,1.0,"So they still have what they can produce normally and they're committed to produce for a revenue, but then they have what they could potentially increase and produce also that they could put into a market for like last minute orders to ramp up production."
34293,PS2,3,672.56,677.52,4.96,1.0,But then that would that would mean like they can't be having like very exclusive contracts.
34293,PS2,3,677.6,678.68,1.08,1.0,I don't know how.
34293,PS2,3,680.08,680.96,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, that could be."
34293,PS2,3,681.68,687.6,5.92,3.0,"But the thing in terms of supply, it's a little bit tricky because they also kind of serve other companies, right?"
34293,PS2,3,688.16,688.32,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
34293,PS2,3,688.32,692.4,4.08,3.0,"So I think, you know, the spare capacity they usually, yeah."
34293,PS2,3,692.8,704.92,12.12,3.0,"Or perhaps a full integration supply to integration, meaning that you kind of own the supply part instead of you kind of, you know, hands on the suppliers 50."
34293,PS2,3,705.92,706.32,0.4,2.0,Seconds left.
34293,PS2,3,706.32,707.84,1.52,2.0,What should I add?
34293,PS2,3,707.84,710.68,2.84,2.0,"Like actually, I like your idea, but how do I write that in a sentence?"
34293,PS2,3,710.68,712.04,1.36,2.0,Do you reckon or do you want to?
34293,PS2,3,712.28,715.48,3.2,1.0,"Yeah, say ownership of supply chain component."
34293,PS2,3,716.24,717.16,0.92,1.0,"Oh, supply chain."
34293,PS2,3,717.76,718.28,0.52,3.0,Ownership.
34293,PS2,3,718.28,722.2,3.92,3.0,"Yeah, ownership or full vertical integration?"
34293,PS2,3,723.04,732.32,9.28,3.0,"Sorry, full vertical vertical integration or maybe in the full practical practical?"
34293,PS2,3,732.36,733.72,1.36,2.0,"Sorry, I don't know what."
34293,PS2,3,733.72,734.12,0.4,1.0,I'm so.
34293,PS2,3,735.0,735.52,0.52,2.0,"Sorry, I did not."
34293,PS2,3,735.56,743.52,7.96,3.0,Hear it?
34293,PS2,3,743.68,744.48,0.8,2.0,"It's OK, just like."
34293,PS2,3,746.44,748.08,1.64,3.0,"A embellishment, though."
34293,PS2,3,749.16,749.76,0.6,2.0,I delete.
34293,PS2,3,749.76,753.08,3.32,2.0,I'm so sorry guys.
35493,PS5,3,0.56,4.36,3.8,1.0,I think the second question you is you really more crazy crazy.
35493,PS5,3,5.92,6.8,0.88,2.0,Voluntary.
35493,PS5,3,10.96,13.68,2.72,2.0,"Oh, oh, you could go anywhere with this."
35493,PS5,3,13.68,24.8,11.12,2.0,It's like pay them more.
35493,PS5,3,25.28,26.48,1.2,2.0,"No, no."
35493,PS5,3,28.12,29.6,1.48,1.0,"Pay them enough, they're going to."
35493,PS5,3,32.68,47.04,14.36,3.0,"Well, I don't know, my mind goes to like Google and free food and like slides and reckon amusement parking in the office basically."
35493,PS5,3,52.32,75.52,23.2,3.0,"But I also think like budget for it depends on the workplace, but budget conferences for like improving yourself, learning your language, travelling like all of that or like 4 to 5 bonuses a year."
35493,PS5,3,113.72,113.84,0.12,1.0,None.
35493,PS5,3,150.26,158.48,8.22,2.0,"Feel like this is a tough one to be creative on because this is, like a very real, real problem."
35493,PS5,3,158.48,158.68,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35493,PS5,3,159.56,162.88,3.32,2.0,"And like, the economic incentives are kind of obvious."
35493,PS5,3,163.8,165.76,1.96,2.0,And that's already in practice.
35493,PS5,3,173.08,188.72,15.64,2.0,"I feel like the only like truly unique thing that other companies can't compete on are like people, you know, it's because like you say, I'm going to give free lunch."
35493,PS5,3,188.72,191.0,2.28,2.0,Another company can give free lunch.
35493,PS5,3,191.0,198.28,7.28,2.0,"But like if you have a relationships at a company, those cannot, another company cannot necessarily like copy that."
35493,PS5,3,198.36,209.85,11.49,2.0,"You know, we got to be creative."
35493,PS5,3,214.32,220.6,6.28,2.0,"One thing is like in like Germany or whatever, in family companies, people probably don't leave."
35493,PS5,3,220.96,224.0,3.04,2.0,"If you inherit something, you probably don't leave."
35493,PS5,3,224.36,235.64,11.28,2.0,"So if you sorted everybody into a company when they're like a toddler, they're gonna it's gonna become part of their identity and then there won't be attrition."
35493,PS5,3,237.72,241.64,3.92,3.0,"Well, you, I mean you can put it in the contract that there'll be stocks like involved, right?"
35493,PS5,3,242.32,243.64,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, shares."
35493,PS5,3,243.64,244.48,0.84,3.0,Of the shares of the.
35493,PS5,3,244.48,245.32,0.84,1.0,"Company, yeah."
35493,PS5,3,247.12,249.4,2.28,3.0,I think that that would always keep something.
35493,PS5,3,284.44,286.52,2.08,2.0,What companies have the least attrition?
35493,PS5,3,293.84,309.84,16.0,2.0,"I wouldn't be surprised if it was like not like like intellectual economy jobs, like somebody might work out like, I don't know, like a construction company their whole life, right?"
35493,PS5,3,309.84,317.04,7.2,2.0,"Or like a fire department where like there's not, it's not as like always looking for the next thing."
35493,PS5,3,317.04,320.2,3.16,2.0,It's more of like a this is what I'm doing.
35493,PS5,3,321.0,333.96,12.96,2.0,"You know, I that that could be, I could be off on that, but I feel like when you get to like Google or whatever, like then you're just surrounded by people that are like even more making even more money."
35493,PS5,3,333.96,336.68,2.72,2.0,"Then it's like, well, shit, I got to go there and do that."
35493,PS5,3,337.08,339.44,2.36,2.0,Whereas like I don't know.
35493,PS5,3,341.92,345.88,3.96,1.0,"I'm thinking about something that maybe when you go to the company, you start parading it."
35493,PS5,3,345.88,348.52,2.64,1.0,"So when you leave, you're thinking about you cannot take it away."
35493,PS5,3,348.52,354.48,5.96,1.0,"So yeah, there's like something still living in the company that you can do, yeah."
35493,PS5,3,358.24,361.12,2.88,2.0,Just like ownership of intellectual property type.
35493,PS5,3,361.6,365.0,3.4,3.0,"Yeah, ownership in it gives you."
35493,PS5,3,365.6,369.08,3.48,1.0,"A little more casual things, something for."
35493,PS5,3,389.52,393.2,3.68,2.0,You could fire people to stop voluntary employee attrition.
35493,PS5,3,393.52,394.88,1.36,2.0,That actually could be creative.
35493,PS5,3,394.88,399.92,5.04,2.0,It's like you have an assessment that gauges how loyal people are to the company.
35493,PS5,3,399.92,402.12,2.2,2.0,"If they don't pass a bar, you just fire them."
35493,PS5,3,402.68,405.16,2.48,2.0,"That is, that is technically a solution."
35493,PS5,3,409.28,411.84,2.56,1.0,They literally stopped voluntary for years.
35493,PS5,3,413.68,416.68,3.0,1.0,It's like we're creating a forecasting system if you wanted to.
35493,PS5,3,417.12,419.04,1.92,2.0,Like I kind of like that actually.
35493,PS5,3,420.2,428.04,7.84,2.0,"Create a create a forecasting system based on like their key strokes or emails or whatever on, build the model and then just start."
35493,PS5,3,428.48,432.2,3.72,1.0,"Yeah, like the e-mail history we saw you like applying to another company."
35493,PS5,3,432.2,433.08,0.88,1.0,So I'm going to do that.
35493,PS5,3,433.88,435.28,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, we're going to fly first."
35493,PS5,3,438.0,438.76,0.76,2.0,Should we do that?
35493,PS5,3,438.84,440.0,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, that might be crazy enough."
35493,PS5,3,440.2,440.44,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35493,PS5,3,440.8,442.12,1.32,2.0,AI isn't going to think of that.
35493,PS5,3,447.48,480.32,32.84,2.0,"OK, so OK, so the first step is to build AML model based on company data to predict the risk of a given employee deciding to leave the company."
35493,PS5,3,481.24,502.2,20.96,2.0,A company can then deploy the model firing anybody who is above a certain threshold risk.
35493,PS5,3,502.48,517.0,14.52,2.0,This will mitigate voluntary employee reduce reduce voluntary employee attrition by making it involuntary OK.
36316,PS6,3,3.72,4.84,1.12,1.0,"Oh, I like that one."

35587,PS5,3,448.0,459.52,11.52,3.0,"I mean, I think another idea that would definitely not work would be usually the problem is that you cannot put yourself in the other person's shoes."
35587,PS5,3,460.0,462.56,2.56,3.0,"So you cannot, you don't know what he's going through."
35587,PS5,3,463.64,464.56,0.92,3.0,So technically.
35587,PS5,3,465.64,467.28,1.64,2.0,Like with people.
35587,PS5,3,467.28,495.24,27.96,3.0,"With the same qualifications, like skills, you could rotate either the managing position or the basically the management position so that so that they're basically like you have one person above you and then you become that person."
35587,PS5,3,495.8,501.32,5.52,3.0,So you can be more compassionate about the people above and the people above can understand the struggle of the person above.
35587,PS5,3,501.44,504.6,3.16,3.0,So the people below can understand the pressure of the person above.
35587,PS5,3,505.12,506.64,1.52,3.0,So there's more understanding.
35587,PS5,3,506.64,517.76,11.12,3.0,"But obviously that cannot work because if it's even if, even if that works perfectly, I mean to just wrap up my work and leave it to you."
35587,PS5,3,518.12,518.76,0.64,3.0,It's just.
35587,PS5,3,519.04,519.92,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, it's crazy."
35587,PS5,3,522.64,527.2,4.56,3.0,"But yeah, maybe we should stick with the first idea."
35587,PS5,3,527.76,528.28,0.52,1.0,Which ones?
35587,PS5,3,530.76,532.56,1.8,3.0,I mean the the counselling.
35587,PS5,3,532.8,535.0,2.2,1.0,"Oh, like having like a council and."
35587,PS5,3,535.36,535.96,0.6,3.0,Just hope.
35587,PS5,3,536.2,537.0,0.8,1.0,That an employee they want to.
35587,PS5,3,537.04,537.88,0.84,3.0,Take it into account.
35587,PS5,3,538.12,545.84,7.72,1.0,"Yeah, I guess like if they're not like above you like because if they're like in a separate department like specifically hired to be like equals with you, maybe it will I."
35587,PS5,3,546.36,560.24,13.88,2.0,"Think we could expand the working, yeah, working environment, healthy working environment by providing each employer with a counsel, yeah, where they vent out their problems."
35587,PS5,3,562.6,580.4,17.8,3.0,"And maybe could also, they could also provide some, some sort of counselling that's not necessarily related to work, like therapy, because, you know, sometimes it's not work per SE that's the problem."
35587,PS5,3,580.52,584.96,4.44,3.0,"It's like your life in general, but it affects your work and your relationship with others."
35587,PS5,3,622.72,623.04,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35587,PS5,3,624.2,629.4,5.2,1.0,"Anything else to add, like actual therapy?"
35587,PS5,3,629.4,649.84,20.44,1.0,"Yeah, which the job registration, Yeah, registrations receive professional."
34213,PS1,3,0.0,1011.88,4.04,1.0,"OK, plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems right?"
34213,PS1,3,1013.36,1016.68,3.32,1.0,"OK, I have always thought about a solution for this."
34213,PS1,3,1017.0,1017.4,0.4,3.0,OK.
34213,PS1,3,1019.04,1026.56,7.52,1.0,"I mean, it's I mean, it's one way of kind of fixing it and let's hear it right."
34213,PS1,3,1026.56,1027.48,0.92,1.0,Of course we could.
34213,PS1,3,1027.48,1041.8,14.32,1.0,"You know, at this stage in time, I don't think there is like a good enough recycling machine or product that can, you know, recycle the plastic bottles."
34213,PS1,3,1042.24,1044.16,1.92,1.0,But I was thinking why not?
34213,PS1,3,1044.16,1050.4,6.24,1.0,Why not having like a spaceship where we could load up with plastic and just send it towards the sun?
34213,PS1,3,1052.0,1052.36,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, and."
34213,PS1,3,1052.8,1053.52,0.72,3.0,The plastic when?
34213,PS1,3,1053.64,1054.16,0.52,1.0,We go there.
34213,PS1,3,1054.64,1056.2,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
34213,PS1,3,1057.08,1060.88,3.8,2.0,"Send all the plastic, Send all the plastic waste to the space."
34213,PS1,3,1060.88,1061.2,0.32,2.0,That's it.
34213,PS1,3,1061.92,1063.12,1.2,1.0,The sun is specific the sun.
34213,PS1,3,1063.12,1064.72,1.6,3.0,So that it will burn.
34213,PS1,3,1064.72,1066.24,1.52,1.0,Completely disappear.
34213,PS1,3,1066.96,1067.84,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, that's good."
34213,PS1,3,1068.12,1068.84,0.72,1.0,"I know, I know."
34213,PS1,3,1068.84,1070.92,2.08,1.0,"It's, I mean, it's expensive."
34213,PS1,3,1072.0,1074.16,2.16,3.0,"You can add that to the price of the plastic, right?"
34213,PS1,3,1074.48,1080.76,6.28,3.0,"But because plastic, we have so many plastic and we can divide it with so many."
34213,PS1,3,1081.08,1084.08,3.0,3.0,So maybe the price is compared to like.
34213,PS1,3,1084.32,1085.32,1.0,1.0,Like they now we have.
34213,PS1,3,1085.32,1088.28,2.96,3.0,"To pay for the paperback, right?"
34213,PS1,3,1089.52,1091.8,2.28,3.0,Maybe at some point people will think it's better than.
34213,PS1,3,1092.48,1093.8,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, because."
34213,PS1,3,1095.08,1101.32,6.24,1.0,"I have always thought, you know, plastic pollution is really one of the worst problems, right?"
34213,PS1,3,1101.32,1105.16,3.84,1.0,Because you see that they have literally islands of plastic pollution.
34213,PS1,3,1105.16,1108.88,3.72,1.0,I think it's in China or India some somewhere around there.
34213,PS1,3,1109.28,1114.4,5.12,1.0,"And you know, all the animals, they, they die by eating, you know, plastic by mistake."
34213,PS1,3,1114.72,1118.44,3.72,1.0,It's supposed that we are eating when we eat fish or or or or.
34213,PS1,3,1119.24,1120.76,1.52,3.0,Or or the seafood.
34213,PS1,3,1121.56,1124.6,3.04,1.0,"They have microplastics, there's we are ingesting that."
34213,PS1,3,1125.56,1133.16,7.6,1.0,"So maybe putting it in a spaceship, it will have to be several spaceships and sending them towards the sun."
34213,PS1,3,1134.56,1137.16,2.6,1.0,"We could potentially decrease it a little bit, right?"
34213,PS1,3,1137.4,1137.72,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
34213,PS1,3,1138.08,1140.84,2.76,3.0,So we don't have to reduce the plastic consumption.
34213,PS1,3,1141.28,1141.92,0.64,1.0,Just.
34213,PS1,3,1143.12,1143.48,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
34213,PS1,3,1143.52,1146.92,3.4,2.0,"So because like usual, because yeah, the send it out surprise."
34213,PS1,3,1147.0,1147.36,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
34213,PS1,3,1147.56,1147.88,0.32,2.0,I mean send.
34213,PS1,3,1147.88,1148.96,1.08,3.0,It to the more to the sun.
34213,PS1,3,1149.32,1157.24,7.92,1.0,It could be it could be in conjunction in like partnership with you know the reducing of the plastic waste that way you will have to.
34213,PS1,3,1157.52,1158.0,0.48,2.0,To.
34213,PS1,3,1158.28,1165.28,7.0,1.0,"Get get a send less plastic to towards the Yeah, but right now."
34213,PS1,3,1166.2,1166.6,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
34213,PS1,3,1167.08,1171.04,3.96,2.0,And the and the question is about to reduce plastic pollution instead of consumption.
34213,PS1,3,1171.04,1183.32,12.28,2.0,"If it is in reducing consumption, we can try to do recycling, we can do an alternative product or plastic and pollution means that it is something that are thrown away and not are being used anymore, right."
34213,PS1,3,1183.32,1192.56,9.24,2.0,"So if someone else pick it up and use it, it's not pollution, but since there are so many things that are not used so we can just send it to outer space."
34213,PS1,3,1192.56,1195.96,3.4,1.0,I'm just going to change this a little bit sure so that it says to the sand because.
34213,PS1,3,1196.12,1197.44,1.32,2.0,"Out of the sand, Yeah, OK, I put it."
34213,PS1,3,1197.44,1197.96,0.52,2.0,Did we send?
34213,PS1,3,1197.96,1200.76,2.8,1.0,"It out to Earth, you know, to the outer space."
34213,PS1,3,1201.08,1202.36,1.28,1.0,We are polluting the space.
34213,PS1,3,1202.36,1203.44,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, we are recycling the space."
34213,PS1,3,1204.44,1204.72,0.28,2.0,OK.
34213,PS1,3,1205.08,1206.44,1.36,2.0,So that's why I put the send it out to our.
34213,PS1,3,1206.52,1209.36,2.84,1.0,Sand we are sure it will disappear completely.
34213,PS1,3,1209.36,1210.6,1.24,2.0,"OK, now we unlock it."
34213,PS1,3,1212.36,1225.64,13.28,2.0,"Maybe this also see on what question will be question be As for me more creative, you know, because sometimes the first one is still con conditional but second order equation sometimes you can be really crazy."
34213,PS1,3,1225.72,1230.48,4.76,1.0,Create regular plastic waste management where you just send all the global plastic wastes to our.
34213,PS1,3,1230.8,1231.04,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34213,PS1,3,1231.52,1233.88,2.36,2.0,"Oh, OK."
34213,PS1,3,1234.12,1234.48,0.36,1.0,Towards.
34213,PS1,3,1235.16,1237.92,2.76,2.0,"Just just change it to outer space, to the to the sun."
34213,PS1,3,1238.4,1239.04,0.64,1.0,There's space.
34213,PS1,3,1239.56,1240.0,0.44,2.0,Outer space.
34213,PS1,3,1240.0,1241.52,1.52,2.0,Change it with the sun towards.
34213,PS1,3,1241.88,1242.28,0.4,1.0,"The sun, yeah."
34213,PS1,3,1242.48,1243.96,1.48,2.0,"Towards the sun, no."
34213,PS1,3,1243.96,1244.68,0.72,1.0,Towards the sun.
34213,PS1,3,1244.72,1245.16,0.44,1.0,This is fun.
34213,PS1,3,1245.28,1245.72,0.44,3.0,Towards.
34213,PS1,3,1245.88,1247.24,1.36,1.0,The Sun next.
34402,PS3,3,0.0,1045.28,2.68,1.0,OK I have some question with this.
34402,PS3,3,1045.28,1049.6,4.32,1.0,It will be sorry in English or will be that version of sorry on all language.
34402,PS3,3,1049.88,1051.24,1.36,2.0,Let's assume all languages.
34402,PS3,3,1051.36,1051.84,0.48,1.0,All language?
34402,PS3,3,1051.92,1052.24,0.32,1.0,Why?
34402,PS3,3,1052.24,1052.52,0.28,1.0,Why?
34402,PS3,3,1052.52,1053.68,1.16,1.0,Why did this happen?
34402,PS3,3,1053.88,1054.16,0.28,3.0,Why?
34402,PS3,3,1054.84,1055.16,0.32,3.0,What kind?
34402,PS3,3,1055.24,1056.12,0.88,1.0,Of pandemic this is.
34402,PS3,3,1056.32,1062.16,5.84,3.0,Once I I I have the experience to correct one person who always want to say sorry to others.
34402,PS3,3,1062.16,1068.96,6.8,3.0,"And I said to her, next time, if you want to say sorry instead you say it doesn't matter, it's OK."
34402,PS3,3,1069.76,1075.44,5.68,3.0,"So because they they, they have, they have probably the same react, not not reaction."
34402,PS3,3,1075.72,1082.88,7.16,3.0,"They can answer the same questions or reaction from others, but they have different meanings and different attitudes."
34402,PS3,3,1083.4,1087.44,4.04,3.0,"So if you want to apologize just to say it doesn't matter, it's OK."
34402,PS3,3,1087.76,1087.88,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34402,PS3,3,1089.4,1092.48,3.08,3.0,So maybe we can exchange the word to another one and then.
34402,PS3,3,1092.88,1095.44,2.56,2.0,It'll take time till the people get used to it.
34402,PS3,3,1095.48,1096.96,1.48,2.0,How do you make sure that it is?
34402,PS3,3,1096.96,1098.4,1.44,2.0,"As soon as possible, yeah."
34402,PS3,3,1099.36,1100.28,0.92,3.0,As soon as possible.
34402,PS3,3,1100.4,1104.08,3.68,2.0,"Like by the time you change the word for the global population, yeah."
34402,PS3,3,1104.28,1105.0,0.72,1.0,Would be infected.
34402,PS3,3,1105.44,1106.8,1.36,3.0,Using the TikTok.
34402,PS3,3,1107.48,1108.08,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, TikTok."
34402,PS3,3,1108.08,1108.44,0.36,1.0,Alright.
34402,PS3,3,1108.44,1110.84,2.4,3.0,It's an activity like people have to.
34402,PS3,3,1111.4,1112.64,1.24,3.0,"It's like a viral, right?"
34402,PS3,3,1112.64,1117.8,5.16,3.0,They just participate in the activity and do the same thing and go viral globally.
34402,PS3,3,1118.04,1126.12,8.08,2.0,"And we create a device which people can wear like a mask, and every every time they say sorry, the word that comes out is different."
34402,PS3,3,1126.84,1127.84,1.0,3.0,It's very creative.
34402,PS3,3,1128.24,1129.24,1.0,3.0,It's a cost.
34402,PS3,3,1129.64,1130.64,1.0,2.0,So people who?
34402,PS3,3,1130.76,1131.64,0.88,1.0,Creative but costly.
34402,PS3,3,1131.64,1135.88,4.24,1.0,But I think they are not asking for expensive or cheaper but.
34402,PS3,3,1135.96,1139.64,3.68,2.0,It won't be costly if you integrate it with your phone.
34402,PS3,3,1139.64,1145.76,6.12,2.0,Like have an app and you put your airports on every time the airports you're sorry what comes out is different.
34402,PS3,3,1145.84,1148.96,3.12,2.0,I think they can create something with existing technology.
34402,PS3,3,1149.64,1151.36,1.72,1.0,Like a mask with a chip something.
34402,PS3,3,1151.36,1151.68,0.32,2.0,Like that.
34402,PS3,3,1151.68,1156.88,5.2,2.0,"So whenever someone says sorry, the word actually does not cross the mask."
34402,PS3,3,1156.88,1161.96,5.08,2.0,It comes out as apologies or so the meaning remains the same but the you cannot hear the word.
34402,PS3,3,1162.28,1165.4,3.12,2.0,So people who can control themselves and not say sorry don't buy it.
34402,PS3,3,1165.4,1167.72,2.32,2.0,But this is for people who absolutely cannot.
34402,PS3,3,1168.88,1174.28,5.4,2.0,Like they are so used to saying sorry that it is difficult for them to stop immediately.
34402,PS3,3,1174.88,1175.72,0.84,1.0,I like the idea.
34402,PS3,3,1175.72,1184.88,9.16,1.0,"I think we can combine this idea with the one of that Tiktok, Tiktok, viral Tiktok with people saying stop using that S word."
34402,PS3,3,1185.4,1188.8,3.4,1.0,It's trying to change our worlds because of this pandemic.
34402,PS3,3,1190.12,1193.72,3.6,3.0,"Yeah, because pandemic is very quickly spreading."
34402,PS3,3,1193.84,1199.56,5.72,3.0,So manufacturing the devices and spread delivering them to to the worldwide.
34402,PS3,3,1199.56,1200.76,1.2,1.0,Maybe it could take time.
34402,PS3,3,1200.76,1201.56,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, take time."
34402,PS3,3,1202.36,1202.96,0.6,3.0,"Yeah, it's a."
34402,PS3,3,1202.96,1209.28,6.32,3.0,It's a nice backup or another Plan B when people really cannot control themselves to do it.
34402,PS3,3,1209.6,1212.0,2.4,1.0,"Yeah, I know some people who cannot double say sorry."
34402,PS3,3,1218.16,1219.24,1.08,1.0,"Why, why why?"
34402,PS3,3,1219.68,1221.48,1.8,1.0,What kind of pandemic is this one?
34402,PS3,3,1222.0,1222.56,0.56,1.0,Very weird.
34402,PS3,3,1227.4,1227.88,0.48,1.0,Thank you.
34402,PS3,3,1228.76,1235.08,6.32,1.0,"Philosophically, it's like the worst doesn't want to people apologize to say sorry."

35068,PS2,6,76.76,79.16,2.4,3.0,And then the second part is the production side.
35068,PS2,6,80.0,86.24,6.24,3.0,"So you have to know your lead time, your demand production, how to manage your cost."
35068,PS2,6,86.24,86.92,0.68,4.0,Of goods sold.
35068,PS2,6,86.96,87.88,0.92,4.0,And the last part is.
35068,PS2,6,88.4,90.68,2.28,3.0,Delivery and talk management.
35068,PS2,6,91.24,91.92,0.68,4.0,So I.
35068,PS2,6,91.92,98.08,6.16,3.0,"I think to tackle the vulnerabilities of the supply chain security, you have to be able to secure."
35068,PS2,6,98.68,100.0,1.32,4.0,The productivity of.
35068,PS2,6,100.04,101.0,0.96,5.0,Each of these.
35068,PS2,6,101.0,103.2,2.2,4.0,Parts and one of the way to.
35068,PS2,6,103.2,103.92,0.72,3.0,Do it is.
35068,PS2,6,103.92,107.04,3.12,4.0,To kind of one of the innovative ways to.
35068,PS2,6,107.44,110.0,2.56,3.0,First you have to be able to predict yourself so.
35068,PS2,6,110.68,111.76,1.08,4.0,You can do as AI.
35068,PS2,6,111.88,119.72,7.84,3.0,Machine learning or algorithm to forecast yourselves to using the algorithm from historical data or external factors.
35068,PS2,6,120.36,124.28,3.92,3.0,"And then for the production part, you just have to create a dashboard to track your progress."
35068,PS2,6,124.72,126.08,1.36,4.0,On what's?
35068,PS2,6,126.08,127.88,1.8,3.0,The lead time of your products.
35068,PS2,6,128.32,135.28,6.96,3.0,What are your production planning plans incorporating the sales forecast?
35068,PS2,6,135.28,140.08,4.8,3.0,Is the production plan going to meet your demand?
35068,PS2,6,140.08,140.48,0.4,3.0,Is it going?
35068,PS2,6,140.48,140.68,0.2,4.0,To be.
35068,PS2,6,140.68,145.44,4.76,3.0,A shortage or is there going to be a surplus even you have to consider?
35068,PS2,6,147.04,147.84,0.8,4.0,Safety stock.
35068,PS2,6,148.32,149.08,0.76,3.0,Is it like?
35068,PS2,6,149.16,151.6,2.44,4.0,The level of safety stock manageable so.
35068,PS2,6,151.8,157.72,5.92,3.0,One of the ways to do it is to similar to sale forecast is to use demand forecasting model.
35068,PS2,6,157.72,158.08,0.36,4.0,To.
35068,PS2,6,158.2,159.48,1.28,5.0,Tackle these kind of things.
35068,PS2,6,159.96,166.92,6.96,3.0,"And then for a delivery, you can use the delivery planning model to kind of mitigate the risk."
35068,PS2,6,166.92,167.12,0.2,4.0,Of.
35068,PS2,6,167.56,169.28,1.72,3.0,Inefficiency.
35068,PS2,6,169.32,170.12,0.8,3.0,Inefficiency.
35068,PS2,6,170.12,173.68,3.56,4.0,Of delivery schedules so similar year.
35068,PS2,6,174.56,181.08,6.52,3.0,"AI, but it's not really AI but just like do a kind of rules or delivery planning to."
35068,PS2,6,181.6,182.72,1.12,4.0,People based on.
35068,PS2,6,183.44,184.16,0.72,3.0,What you.
35068,PS2,6,184.52,186.68,2.16,4.0,Came up with for example delivery based on.
35068,PS2,6,186.68,187.12,0.44,3.0,Area.
35068,PS2,6,187.12,192.32,5.2,4.0,Daily based on your customer size or the frequency of sales.
35068,PS2,6,192.84,197.36,4.52,1.0,And replace human with robot.
35068,PS2,6,204.72,214.68,9.96,1.0,Oh right like uh huh yeah maybe he always go to toy maybe like it cost delay delivery like human error as much as.
35068,PS2,6,214.68,214.96,0.28,4.0,Possible.
35068,PS2,6,216.16,221.8,5.64,3.0,"Yeah, so instead of using human to make decisions, we use machines."
35068,PS2,6,222.12,225.76,3.64,3.0,But let human do order labor book that required we.
35068,PS2,6,226.2,232.12,5.92,1.0,"Can have machines do that as well, like Amazon in the inventory the house."
35068,PS2,6,232.44,237.24,4.8,1.0,They also use robots decision.
35068,PS2,6,237.72,237.96,0.24,3.0,Good job.
35068,PS2,6,238.56,239.16,0.6,1.0,Making.
35068,PS2,6,240.0,240.28,0.28,3.0,Have to.
35068,PS2,6,240.28,240.84,0.56,1.0,Be creative.
35068,PS2,6,241.64,245.72,4.08,1.0,"Yeah, you always have problem with my."
35068,PS2,6,246.08,247.24,1.16,4.0,"No, no, no problem."
35068,PS2,6,249.0,251.32,2.32,3.0,I think we all.
35068,PS2,6,254.96,256.52,1.56,1.0,Have the same theme at least.
35068,PS2,6,257.96,269.4,11.44,1.0,So one creative idea is to replace human with robot AI to help forecast demand and make decision to reduce delay human errors.
35068,PS2,6,270.12,272.92,2.8,3.0,"Yes, just like to frame the item."
35068,PS2,6,273.4,273.6,0.2,1.0,OK.
35068,PS2,6,275.36,276.08,0.72,3.0,Use.
35068,PS2,6,282.2,286.6,4.4,2.0,When I say like human develop application all in one application.
35068,PS2,6,288.44,300.24,11.8,1.0,Human develop human develop human develop AI.
35068,PS2,6,301.24,301.76,0.52,3.0,Like this?
35068,PS2,6,302.0,305.36,3.36,2.0,Human develop all in one application.
35068,PS2,6,306.0,306.48,0.48,1.0,Or.
35068,PS2,6,306.64,307.2,0.56,2.0,Using.
35068,PS2,6,307.56,312.44,4.88,1.0,AI application using AI and other technology.
35068,PS2,6,312.72,313.2,0.48,4.0,Code.
35068,PS2,6,315.04,316.0,0.96,2.0,To control.
35068,PS2,6,317.16,320.4,3.24,3.0,To forecast.
35068,PS2,6,320.88,322.08,1.2,1.0,Demand sales.
35068,PS2,6,330.96,335.36,4.4,1.0,Sales to forecast demand.
35068,PS2,6,336.32,343.56,7.24,6.0,"We can actually elaborate a little bit, but the forecast demand, this one is a lead time."
35068,PS2,6,346.36,349.04,2.68,6.0,I think we should have something like controlling.
35068,PS2,6,349.04,350.84,1.8,2.0,All the robots and machine as well.
35068,PS2,6,350.84,358.32,7.48,1.0,"Yeah, we're not to forecast the demand and sales, to estimate the time and to manage inventory."
35068,PS2,6,359.8,361.08,1.28,6.0,I think it's worth mentioning.
35068,PS2,6,361.24,363.68,2.44,2.0,About machine and robots using this app.
35068,PS2,6,364.24,369.8,5.56,2.0,"So human developed the whole thing, but all the level tasks are done by the."
35068,PS2,6,370.28,370.76,0.48,1.0,Or.
35068,PS2,6,371.36,371.68,0.32,4.0,Robot.
35068,PS2,6,372.24,376.48,4.24,1.0,Side also good.
35068,PS2,6,378.84,379.08,0.24,3.0,Job.
35068,PS2,6,382.0,390.24,8.24,1.0,Like table work minimize human error by using robot or AII.
35068,PS2,6,392.64,394.96,2.32,3.0,Guess we conclude that like the thing that.
35068,PS2,6,394.96,395.52,0.56,4.0,Caused.
35068,PS2,6,396.24,400.92,4.68,3.0,Uncontrolled cost and inefficient deliveries came from human error.
35068,PS2,6,410.84,415.16,4.32,1.0,"To reduce, to minimize human."
35068,PS2,6,415.56,416.32,0.76,3.0,Career.
35068,PS2,6,432.56,437.12,4.56,3.0,Leave it to our work thought.
35068,PS2,6,437.12,440.92,3.8,1.0,Process OK.
34483,PS1,3,21.92,25.64,3.72,1.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environment problems of our lifetime.
34483,PS1,3,26.16,29.44,3.28,1.0,Please come up with an idea to reduce plastic pollution.
34483,PS1,3,32.56,34.0,1.44,3.0,Better plastic which you can burn.
34483,PS1,3,35.6,36.36,0.76,2.0,Burnable plastic.
34483,PS1,3,36.6,37.36,0.76,3.0,Burnable plastic.
34483,PS1,3,40.12,41.0,0.88,2.0,No rushing you.
34483,PS1,3,41.08,41.88,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34483,PS1,3,44.8,48.12,3.32,3.0,Close down plastic factories so remove plastic from.
34483,PS1,3,48.6,49.92,1.32,2.0,"No, The thing is that you need to."
34483,PS1,3,50.88,51.68,0.8,1.0,"Sorry, something else?"
34483,PS1,3,51.92,53.56,1.64,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, because you don't need plastic in your life."
34483,PS1,3,53.76,54.08,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
34483,PS1,3,55.24,56.52,1.28,3.0,What's an alternative plastic?
34483,PS1,3,58.48,58.8,0.32,2.0,I don't know.
34483,PS1,3,58.88,59.36,0.48,2.0,Silicon.
34483,PS1,3,59.52,59.88,0.36,2.0,Silicon.
34483,PS1,3,60.96,61.28,0.32,2.0,I don't know.
34483,PS1,3,61.6,64.36,2.76,1.0,"But it's it's also pollutable, so."
34483,PS1,3,64.36,65.4,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, right?"
34483,PS1,3,65.4,67.84,2.44,3.0,I think it's we have to come up with a creative solution for plastic only.
34483,PS1,3,68.8,72.16,3.36,2.0,"Yeah, and I don't know if I don't know if silicon is actually a solution."
34483,PS1,3,77.2,79.04,1.84,2.0,How do you solve the problem of plastic I?
34483,PS1,3,80.2,85.52,5.32,1.0,Think that plastic is mostly used in like packaging and stuff like that so.
34483,PS1,3,86.64,90.16,3.52,3.0,"Plastic is used for everything, but not every plastic you throw away, right?"
34483,PS1,3,90.16,90.44,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, so."
34483,PS1,3,91.04,91.92,0.88,2.0,"You just, yeah, yeah."
34483,PS1,3,91.92,97.24,5.32,2.0,"So, so plastic, I don't know make single use."
34483,PS1,3,97.36,110.08,12.72,2.0,"So we use plastics cannot be totally banned, but make it so that every piece of single use plastic can and is mandatory to be recycled."
34483,PS1,3,111.84,113.68,1.84,3.0,And so there's a fine for not recycling.
34483,PS1,3,114.52,115.16,0.64,2.0,"But, you know, yeah."
34483,PS1,3,115.44,117.4,1.96,1.0,But how do you implement this globally?
34483,PS1,3,117.4,124.24,6.84,3.0,"Yeah, what if what if you make give people money for recycling or."
34483,PS1,3,124.76,127.84,3.08,1.0,"They do this in Germany, yeah."
34483,PS1,3,128.04,128.48,0.44,2.0,They do that.
34483,PS1,3,129.08,130.76,1.68,1.0,"In Germany, well, yeah, they do that, yes."
34483,PS1,3,130.84,131.68,0.84,3.0,We could do that everywhere.
34483,PS1,3,132.48,132.6,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34483,PS1,3,133.0,137.12,4.12,3.0,Why would you throw away plastic if you're going to get like some money for giving your?
34483,PS1,3,137.64,141.44,3.8,1.0,But I I like that first idea of like doing a better plastic.
34483,PS1,3,141.44,146.32,4.88,1.0,You can just burn and you can like maybe even burn to create energy.
34483,PS1,3,146.32,146.68,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, but."
34483,PS1,3,147.12,148.0,0.88,2.0,That's a good idea.
34483,PS1,3,148.2,150.24,2.04,2.0,That way you create an inceptive to burn it.
34483,PS1,3,150.52,150.8,0.28,1.0,So.
34483,PS1,3,151.44,152.4,0.96,2.0,Create I think.
34483,PS1,3,152.44,153.32,0.88,2.0,I think that's a good idea.
34483,PS1,3,154.48,162.76,8.28,2.0,Create a machine that uses burn plastic for energy or something.
34483,PS1,3,162.84,165.12,2.28,2.0,"For example, you used to instead of coal."
34483,PS1,3,165.36,166.84,1.48,2.0,"Instead of burning coal, you burn plastic."
34483,PS1,3,169.36,171.56,2.2,3.0,Can plastic be biodegradable?
34483,PS1,3,172.36,178.92,6.56,2.0,"Yes, but the definition where the gravel is quite loose, but yeah, it should."
34483,PS1,3,178.92,183.84,4.92,2.0,"But The thing is that there are plastic, you don't want them to be biodegradable, for example the tubes."
34483,PS1,3,185.6,193.4,7.8,2.0,"So water tubes, pipelines or pipelines, you don't want to do biodegradable because you don't want to have leakage everywhere in the your house."
34483,PS1,3,195.56,196.12,0.56,2.0,That's a good idea.
34483,PS1,3,196.12,200.72,4.6,2.0,"That way, for example, you can you can create an industry that that, yeah."
34483,PS1,3,200.72,206.0,5.28,2.0,And that actual and that and that takes plastic out of the ocean to burn it to create energy because it's all useful the energy.
34483,PS1,3,206.2,206.36,0.16,2.0,What?
34483,PS1,3,206.76,211.64,4.88,3.0,"If you made plastic so expensive that people couldn't use it, and I'll just push that."
34483,PS1,3,212.52,215.04,2.52,1.0,Just makes life bad bad for poor people.
34483,PS1,3,215.16,221.76,6.6,2.0,"Yeah, for everyone again, if it's too expensive to use, what do you use to food for pipelines?"
34483,PS1,3,222.72,224.08,1.36,2.0,Pipelines and mirror plastic.
34483,PS1,3,224.08,227.92,3.84,2.0,"Yeah, if you don't use plastic, what do you use?"
34483,PS1,3,228.36,232.32,3.96,2.0,"If it's because the alternative was iron or metal, but the."
34483,PS1,3,232.36,233.44,1.08,3.0,Invented new materials.
34483,PS1,3,233.68,234.56,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, I think that it's."
34483,PS1,3,234.56,236.88,2.32,3.0,Subsidies on alternative.
34483,PS1,3,237.6,237.76,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
34483,PS1,3,237.76,240.92,3.16,1.0,I think that that is like create a plastic that you can burn that it's.
34483,PS1,3,240.92,241.88,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, I think that's a good one."
34483,PS1,3,242.48,245.52,3.04,2.0,Basically you can burn to to to make energy that way you.
34483,PS1,3,245.56,247.28,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, you have a circular."
34483,PS1,3,247.28,248.2,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, but it's not."
34483,PS1,3,248.24,249.08,0.84,2.0,But it's not plastic.
34483,PS1,3,249.08,250.52,1.44,2.0,It's the the machine.
34483,PS1,3,250.52,254.16,3.64,2.0,"Because if you if you create the plastic, then it's new production."
34483,PS1,3,254.16,257.24,3.08,2.0,"But if you create a machine, they can use all plastic."
34483,PS1,3,257.84,261.32,3.48,2.0,Then you create incentives to pick up the the plastic from the ocean.
34483,PS1,3,261.68,263.32,1.64,1.0,"Oh yeah, that's that's nice."
34483,PS1,3,266.96,271.92,4.96,1.0,So I think that answer could be like create a machine that burns plastic to generate energy.
34483,PS1,3,272.08,278.52,6.44,1.0,"This plastic will have resids for now, but then at least it's like low like it's the solution."
34483,PS1,3,278.52,288.8,10.28,1.0,"And but then together with that you also develop plastic to like you don't put new plastic that is not burnable out, but you also try to."
34483,PS1,3,313.34,313.66,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
34483,PS1,3,314.22,315.02,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34483,PS1,3,315.18,315.46,0.28,2.0,Next.
34996,PS4,3,0.68,3.76,3.08,1.0,"Oh, education inequality is an."

35229,PS6,3,29.48,36.84,7.36,2.0,The the the doors lock and stay open only up to but singing in the shower for 20 minutes means you have to take a bath for 20 minutes.
35229,PS6,3,36.84,41.56,4.72,2.0,"And if everyone starts taking bath for 20 minutes, that's going to be a problem."
35229,PS6,3,43.32,45.4,2.08,2.0,So it just locks the door for 20 minutes.
35229,PS6,3,47.96,48.72,0.76,2.0,That's that's it.
35229,PS6,3,62.64,64.36,1.72,1.0,Wait continuously or sing.

35229,PS6,3,105.48,107.84,2.36,1.0,So set a monthly.
35229,PS6,3,107.84,108.76,0.92,2.0,Shower requirement.
35229,PS6,3,109.64,111.4,1.76,1.0,Shower requirement.

35229,PS6,3,124.16,126.0,1.84,2.0,They will have their penalty.
35229,PS6,3,129.48,136.08,6.6,2.0,"They need to sing in public, or sing in public, or sing in."
35229,PS6,3,136.08,136.32,0.24,1.0,Public.
35229,PS6,3,137.92,141.68,3.76,2.0,"Or sing in public, perform in public, perform a concert in public."
35229,PS6,3,142.68,143.84,1.16,2.0,Because you have to get back there.
35229,PS6,3,147.44,147.52,0.08,3.0,Of.
35229,PS6,3,147.52,149.2,1.68,2.0,Course it is love concept.

35229,PS6,3,150.88,151.48,0.6,2.0,"OK, done."
35229,PS6,3,151.48,153.08,1.6,2.0,I think that's that's the most.
35229,PS6,3,155.08,157.28,2.2,2.0,I'm honestly the happiest with this.
36144,PS5,3,10.88,13.24,2.36,1.0,"OK, creative idea."
36144,PS5,3,13.4,20.56,7.16,2.0,"I mean, incentives like introduce incentives for them to stay."
36144,PS5,3,21.12,27.32,6.2,2.0,"I don't know, like because I know there are some like London firms that have like free food or free lunch, free dinner or something like that."
36144,PS5,3,27.56,30.48,2.92,2.0,Is that something that would make like benefits?
36144,PS5,3,30.48,33.6,3.12,1.0,I think basically making working conditions more bearable.
36144,PS5,3,35.12,37.2,2.08,2.0,"But wait, how can we make it creative though?"
36144,PS5,3,37.24,37.96,0.72,2.0,I don't understand.
36144,PS5,3,37.96,38.32,0.36,2.0,It's just.
36144,PS5,3,38.32,41.36,3.04,3.0,"Like, yeah, also, I mean, we don't have a lot of information."
36144,PS5,3,44.24,47.6,3.36,1.0,Creative solutions do not make people leave their jobs.
36144,PS5,3,47.8,48.64,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36144,PS5,3,48.64,51.96,3.32,3.0,"So yeah, they like work life balance, but it's not creative."
36144,PS5,3,51.96,52.28,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, so."
36144,PS5,3,52.28,52.56,0.28,2.0,What is?
36144,PS5,3,52.96,60.88,7.92,3.0,"Creative, yeah, yeah, I think creating a good community, maybe within the within the jobs."
36144,PS5,3,60.96,61.92,0.96,2.0,Like more social?
36144,PS5,3,61.92,62.32,0.4,3.0,Events.
36144,PS5,3,62.32,63.36,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, more social events."
36144,PS5,3,63.36,66.0,2.64,1.0,It's saying please come up with one creative idea.
36144,PS5,3,66.16,67.0,0.84,2.0,"Oh my God, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,67.72,69.2,1.48,1.0,"OK, so should be a top notch more."
36144,PS5,3,70.16,70.48,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,87.88,88.48,0.6,1.0,What are you?
36144,PS5,3,99.84,104.68,4.84,1.0,"I guess there must be some kind of, you know, conversation between the management and the employees."
36144,PS5,3,104.8,108.8,4.0,1.0,It could be through like a task wise rating system.
36144,PS5,3,108.8,122.4,13.6,1.0,"Like this is how much I enjoyed the doing the task and then kind of being able to say whatever you guys like said right now of in terms of how much community and teamwork there was, whether there was like enough incentives provided during the course of that task."
36144,PS5,3,122.92,136.8,13.88,1.0,"Or like, I guess just if they were working under a particular boss during that time, were they given like, I guess other incentives including just taking them out for a while, giving them their space?"
36144,PS5,3,138.88,139.4,0.52,1.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,139.48,145.52,6.04,1.0,But I think there must be like the solution must more be like a conversation between management employee.
36144,PS5,3,146.92,152.24,5.32,1.0,"And I'm like, I honestly don't believe in feedback forms."
36144,PS5,3,152.36,152.64,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,152.64,153.76,1.12,2.0,Then it is like feedback.
36144,PS5,3,154.08,158.04,3.96,1.0,"Forms, yeah, but then I'm not sure what else."
36144,PS5,3,158.04,162.44,4.4,1.0,"Like OK, what else can initiate conversations with the management or employee?"
36144,PS5,3,166.68,169.6,2.92,2.0,"I guess first we need to figure out why people want to leave, right?"
36144,PS5,3,169.68,172.56,2.88,2.0,Then we figure out the solution for why they want to leave.
36144,PS5,3,173.24,176.36,3.12,3.0,"Do you think that money could like, swim the situation?"
36144,PS5,3,176.36,176.68,0.32,3.0,No.
36144,PS5,3,176.68,182.84,6.16,2.0,"Because if that's the case, like I know a lot of people who like, maybe they earn like big bucks, but they want to leave after like two or three years."
36144,PS5,3,183.16,183.56,0.4,2.0,So.
36144,PS5,3,185.08,185.36,0.28,2.0,Right.
36144,PS5,3,185.36,187.44,2.08,2.0,"Like if it's really for the money, yeah, true."
36144,PS5,3,188.84,190.4,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, I don't think it's a money."
36144,PS5,3,209.8,220.44,10.64,3.0,"Maybe like every week you, you have like anonymous questionnaire where you can like report freely all the problems every week."
36144,PS5,3,221.08,233.28,12.2,3.0,"And then there is a sort of team that try to like, yeah, analyse all these data and some of the situation in some ways, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,233.32,244.08,10.76,3.0,"I mean, I think that's your idea of feedback with the, with the boss and with the companies like the best idea because you you can understand which, which are the problems that I mean, in this case it's super generic."
36144,PS5,3,244.08,244.44,0.36,3.0,So yeah.
36144,PS5,3,244.72,248.96,4.24,1.0,I cannot especially like you can do that per task or per weekly basis or whatever.
36144,PS5,3,248.96,255.44,6.48,1.0,"But yeah, I'm just like, ultimately, when I do feedback forms, I'm not thinking that deep, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,255.84,261.44,5.6,2.0,"I mean people, but could it feel like doing a feedback form feels like an extra task in itself rather than an?"
36144,PS5,3,261.44,261.88,0.44,3.0,Actual.
36144,PS5,3,261.88,266.92,5.04,3.0,But if you have a problem then you I think you are really motivated in creating a sort of complaint thing.
36144,PS5,3,267.56,269.04,1.48,1.0,It's like there's an Ave.
36144,PS5,3,269.04,270.28,1.24,1.0,in case you have a problem.
36144,PS5,3,270.32,274.64,4.32,1.0,"Yeah, if you don't have a problem then you just fill it as a part of your task test."
36144,PS5,3,274.84,275.12,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,275.32,280.16,4.84,3.0,Or like an external third party that could be consulted if you have a problem.
36144,PS5,3,280.2,283.56,3.36,2.0,"So you know how like in university we have like, well-being officers Exactly."
36144,PS5,3,283.56,285.6,2.04,2.0,OK Can there be something like that?
36144,PS5,3,285.68,285.92,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,286.36,286.52,0.16,2.0,Like.
36144,PS5,3,287.72,288.24,0.52,1.0,Like a Chuck.
36144,PS5,3,288.68,289.0,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,289.16,289.4,0.24,2.0,Right.
36144,PS5,3,289.56,290.96,1.4,2.0,So that that could be a solution.
36144,PS5,3,290.96,295.96,5.0,2.0,"So if you have a problem, maybe it's not a weekly form or something, but you have that Ave."
36144,PS5,3,296.16,296.96,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36144,PS5,3,297.04,297.36,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,298.08,299.48,1.4,2.0,So the well-being officer would.
36144,PS5,3,299.48,299.96,0.48,3.0,Be a great.
36144,PS5,3,300.0,301.4,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, I think it's a good idea."
36144,PS5,3,301.4,302.84,1.44,3.0,Like complete external.
36144,PS5,3,303.08,303.32,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,303.6,306.92,3.32,3.0,And everything completely anonymous I guess otherwise.
36144,PS5,3,307.04,308.0,0.96,2.0,Like confidential?
36144,PS5,3,308.0,308.68,0.68,3.0,Confidential.
36144,PS5,3,308.68,308.96,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,309.04,309.88,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, OK."
36144,PS5,3,310.64,315.4,4.76,1.0,"OK, so I'm going to write putting."
36144,PS5,3,316.92,318.08,1.16,1.0,"Wait, there's no capital."
36144,PS5,3,319.28,331.72,12.44,1.0,"OK, never mind putting in place an external body akin to a well-being."
36144,PS5,3,333.4,333.52,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,340.4,346.84,6.44,1.0,I can do a living theme to.
36144,PS5,3,350.92,357.44,6.52,2.0,Like to be able to express issues and problems confidentially.
36144,PS5,3,364.56,366.04,1.48,1.0,"For the employees to be, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,367.4,367.52,0.12,3.0,OK.
36144,PS5,3,371.76,379.96,8.2,1.0,Would be one way to address employee.
36144,PS5,3,379.96,380.56,0.6,3.0,Attraction.
36144,PS5,3,380.72,381.68,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,383.4,384.76,1.36,1.0,Do we justify why?
36144,PS5,3,386.56,389.0,2.44,1.0,I think so like one or two lines like OK.
36144,PS5,3,389.84,395.0,5.16,3.0,But I think then also this body should be like able to analyse all this information.
36144,PS5,3,395.0,395.12,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,395.24,395.92,0.68,3.0,And be they should.
36144,PS5,3,395.92,397.48,1.56,1.0,Be able to mediate between.
36144,PS5,3,397.48,398.96,1.48,3.0,The exact employers.
36144,PS5,3,398.96,399.12,0.16,1.0,In the.
36144,PS5,3,399.12,399.96,0.84,3.0,"Company, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,400.44,400.68,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,401.64,401.8,0.16,3.0,Such.
36144,PS5,3,403.2,405.08,1.88,2.0,1/3.
36144,PS5,3,405.2,418.0,12.8,1.0,Party would be able to mediate the issues arising from the employment.
36144,PS5,3,418.44,420.04,1.6,2.0,I feel bad for.
36144,PS5,3,420.36,434.6,14.24,1.0,You Oh no with between the employers and employees.
36144,PS5,3,435.12,435.24,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,440.96,454.68,13.72,1.0,"It would account, I think it would account for both like, you know, individual cases like, but also if they know that, you know, a group of people are facing the same issues and that individually approach them, they'll be able to sort of club the concerns together."
36144,PS5,3,454.92,455.12,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,456.48,456.8,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,457.32,482.72,25.4,1.0,"It could also, I guess, be representative of individual concerns such as termination of contract or collective issues affecting the whole the employment."
36144,PS5,3,482.88,486.12,3.24,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,486.12,492.72,6.6,3.0,And I think he should be also like enough power to actually convince them the employer to to make some changes.
36144,PS5,3,493.4,505.52,12.12,3.0,"So it should be, yeah, like it should be like the should be able to maybe feed the employee in some way."
36144,PS5,3,505.64,523.52,17.88,1.0,"Yeah, this body should be able to influence and convince and then have the power, should be able to, should have the authority."
36144,PS5,3,523.76,523.96,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,524.96,525.32,0.36,1.0,To.
36144,PS5,3,526.52,528.88,2.36,2.0,But maybe there's no way they can actually influence.
36144,PS5,3,528.88,530.28,1.4,2.0,Maybe they can only inform.
36144,PS5,3,530.28,531.92,1.64,2.0,But what the employer does is like.
36144,PS5,3,532.24,532.8,0.56,2.0,Up to them though.
36144,PS5,3,533.4,535.72,2.32,1.0,I think that's why she's saying that.
36144,PS5,3,536.56,541.6,5.04,3.0,Like some sort of maybe also economical fees.
36144,PS5,3,541.64,543.92,2.28,3.0,"I was called like, oh, economical."
36144,PS5,3,544.76,545.2,0.44,1.0,Like.
36144,PS5,3,545.48,549.64,4.16,3.0,"Expenses in case you don't solve the situation, basically something like that."
36144,PS5,3,549.96,551.28,1.32,3.0,So to incentivize.
36144,PS5,3,552.2,552.56,0.36,2.0,No.
36144,PS5,3,554.32,554.76,0.44,3.0,I need.

36144,PS5,3,577.36,577.56,0.2,3.0,Yep.
36144,PS5,3,580.8,582.64,1.84,2.0,"Or with the law, maybe not the government."

36144,PS5,3,589.96,595.28,5.32,1.0,Offer this partition as I thought you could feel nice if I mean you could make more comment if there's.
36144,PS5,3,595.28,596.28,1.0,2.0,If neglect.
36144,PS5,3,596.44,598.84,2.4,1.0,"Something yeah, if if the company does not comply."
36144,PS5,3,599.48,599.6,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS5,3,601.6,602.64,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, or cooperate."
36144,PS5,3,602.88,603.12,0.24,2.0,OK.
36144,PS5,3,604.12,605.84,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36144,PS5,3,605.84,607.12,1.28,2.0,"Oh, it's the company, I think."

36144,PS5,3,610.8,611.32,0.52,3.0,"OK, I think."
36144,PS5,3,611.36,611.48,0.12,2.0,It's.
36144,PS5,3,611.68,612.24,0.56,2.0,I think that's good.
36144,PS5,3,612.56,613.92,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, next."
34428,PS2,3,0.0,147.4,1.16,2.0,Supply chain security.
34428,PS2,3,147.4,150.12,2.72,2.0,I have no idea how what this means.
34428,PS2,3,153.92,155.6,1.68,1.0,I guess like supply chain is.
34428,PS2,3,156.92,158.6,1.68,2.0,"Manufacturing, yeah."
34428,PS2,3,158.84,159.52,0.68,2.0,And then?
34428,PS2,3,161.52,162.24,0.72,1.0,Security.
34428,PS2,3,184.41,186.13,1.72,1.0,Make people study economy more.
34428,PS2,3,186.41,189.45,3.04,2.0,"Yeah, more business degrees."
34428,PS2,3,190.69,191.33,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, I don't know."
34428,PS2,3,191.33,198.97,7.64,2.0,"Because, OK, so it means like from manufacturing and then like transport to wherever it's going to go."
34428,PS2,3,198.97,210.84,11.87,2.0,"And then So what would make, what would, what are the vulnerabilities, what would make it go wrong like if the demand was too high for the supply?"
34428,PS2,3,211.64,215.64,4.0,1.0,Or like the raw products are very expensive or unavailable.
34428,PS2,3,220.84,222.6,1.76,3.0,Inefficient delivery schedule.
34428,PS2,3,223.32,224.24,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, I don't know."
34428,PS2,3,226.24,239.6,13.36,2.0,"It just makes me think of, you know, that boat that got stuck in the Suez Canal, you know, the Evergreen, like the big, like the big, that cargo boat got stuck in the canal and like none of the votes could come through."
34428,PS2,3,239.6,247.52,7.92,2.0,"And so that was like a big, that's the only thing I can think of where there was like a big disruption because like nothing could get to where it was going."
34428,PS2,3,247.92,250.68,2.76,2.0,But I don't know how you creatively tackle that.
34428,PS2,3,250.68,250.96,0.28,2.0,That's such.
34428,PS2,3,251.64,252.24,0.6,1.0,A case by.
34428,PS2,3,252.24,255.24,3.0,2.0,"Case Yeah, yeah, there's so many ways."
34428,PS2,3,255.48,257.32,1.84,2.0,"I guess we just have to come up with one idea, the AI."
34428,PS2,3,258.92,259.72,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, the AI can do all that."
34428,PS2,3,272.84,274.56,1.72,2.0,Inefficient delivery schedules.
34428,PS2,3,274.56,288.68,14.12,2.0,"You could use AI or something to make because like then you're kind of eliminating the human error and it could probably, I don't know, some kind of algorithm to make to like fit the schedule so that it's the most efficient."
34428,PS2,3,289.4,290.88,1.48,1.0,So basically better prediction.
34428,PS2,3,291.16,294.52,3.36,2.0,"Yeah, I think so, but I don't know how that works."
34428,PS2,3,294.52,295.56,1.04,2.0,But I don't know.
34428,PS2,3,295.56,297.08,1.52,2.0,"We're just coming up with the ideas, aren't we?"
34428,PS2,3,298.68,304.28,5.6,3.0,Make some computing things to make a model how we arrange the deliveries in.
34428,PS2,3,304.44,305.08,0.64,1.0,Time and.
34428,PS2,3,306.04,307.24,1.2,3.0,Deliver enough things.
34428,PS2,3,308.4,315.12,6.72,1.0,And like more specific to like a country or like every country would have it's own model.
34428,PS2,3,315.64,317.04,1.4,2.0,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
34428,PS2,3,341.28,341.84,0.56,2.0,Is that alright?
34428,PS2,3,346.76,348.88,2.12,2.0,Is that shall I add anything else or is that good?
34428,PS2,3,350.56,351.48,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, I think that's."
34428,PS2,3,353.44,353.56,0.12,3.0,Fine.
34428,PS2,3,353.56,363.36,9.8,3.0,I think maybe the factories industrial can have a package which have different things the the customer or the client might need.
34428,PS2,3,363.6,371.52,7.92,3.0,"Like maybe we want to make some dishes, we want all ingredients in one basket that they can deliver."
34428,PS2,3,372.64,372.92,0.28,1.0,Something.
34428,PS2,3,373.6,374.68,1.08,2.0,"Oh yeah, I see what you mean."
34428,PS2,3,374.68,381.96,7.28,2.0,"So like it's like rather than sending everything separately, send like, yeah, OK, how do I put that into words?"
34428,PS2,3,386.08,390.72,4.64,1.0,Maybe if like different companies that are codependent on each other.
34428,PS2,3,390.76,401.56,10.8,1.0,"Yeah, if they can have like one point where they send everything to and then from that point they assemble it based on client and then they send it to the client."
34428,PS2,3,402.24,403.4,1.16,2.0,"OK, how should I wear that?"
34428,PS2,3,420.8,424.8,4.0,2.0,"Oh, how I've done the how do I get out of this?"
34428,PS2,3,430.04,438.88,8.84,2.0,"This, Yeah."
34428,PS2,3,461.48,468.64,7.16,1.0,"Yeah, before shipping to, they can be assembled by customer basis or something like that."
34428,PS2,3,469.2,470.8,1.6,2.0,Assembled for customers.
34428,PS2,3,473.24,478.24,5.0,1.0,"Yeah, how to say that it's the for each customer, they will assemble their stuff together."
34428,PS2,3,478.88,480.04,1.16,2.0,"Oh yeah, so it's like."
34428,PS2,3,483.68,486.52,2.84,3.0,Like gamble each ingredients together as a package.
34428,PS2,3,487.68,489.16,1.48,2.0,So assemble a.
34428,PS2,3,489.92,491.76,1.84,1.0,Package for each customer.
34428,PS2,3,491.8,494.08,2.28,1.0,"One package per customer, so."
34428,PS2,3,495.52,498.92,3.4,3.0,That we reduce the cost of delivery separately.
34213,PS3,3,0.0,609.96,4.84,2.0,"Imagine the new pandemic has emerged that is transmitted by saying, OK, sorry."
34213,PS3,3,615.84,616.76,0.92,2.0,It's very it's.
34213,PS3,3,616.84,617.32,0.48,3.0,Very.
34213,PS3,3,617.64,617.8,0.16,1.0,It's.
34213,PS3,3,618.76,618.92,0.16,2.0,Hard.
34213,PS3,3,620.24,620.64,0.4,2.0,OK.
34213,PS3,3,621.04,624.88,3.84,2.0,What kind of situation that usually make you say sorry are?
34213,PS3,3,625.6,626.24,0.64,1.0,You messed up.
34213,PS3,3,628.24,635.76,7.52,2.0,"When you do some, so it has to be doing something or something something else or to someone, right?"
34213,PS3,3,635.76,637.28,1.52,2.0,Because do you?
34213,PS3,3,637.4,641.36,3.96,2.0,Do you think you ever say sorry about things that you've done yourself?
34213,PS3,3,642.48,643.32,0.84,1.0,"To myself, yeah."
34213,PS3,3,643.52,648.96,5.44,2.0,"I mean when, when you are not in front of people or when you are not interacting with people, do you say sorry, but."
34213,PS3,3,648.96,650.0,1.04,3.0,You don't say out loud.
34213,PS3,3,650.16,653.96,3.8,3.0,"If no, this question is whether just thinking the word sorry, no, it's already."
34213,PS3,3,655.04,656.36,1.32,1.0,"Saying the word sorry, right?"
34213,PS3,3,656.52,660.16,3.64,2.0,"Yeah, so if I, if I spill my coffee in front of you, I will say sorry, right?"
34213,PS3,3,660.24,662.08,1.84,2.0,"But if I spill it myself, it'll just, ah, damn it."
34213,PS3,3,662.08,663.28,1.2,2.0,"Something like that, right?"
34213,PS3,3,663.64,676.52,12.88,1.0,"Maybe maybe one solution could be creating some kind of bracelet, but once once it hears you say the word sorry, it gives you like a."
34213,PS3,3,676.92,677.32,0.4,3.0,That's good.
34213,PS3,3,677.44,678.56,1.12,1.0,Like a electric shock.
34213,PS3,3,679.0,680.44,1.44,2.0,"OK, so."
34213,PS3,3,680.8,682.4,1.6,2.0,"Oh yeah, yeah, I understand what you mean."

34213,PS3,3,691.12,705.24,14.12,2.0,"Implement implement microchip in everyone that allow artificial intelligence neighborhood where when you when you're tongue say something that's similar to sorry, it will guilty and."
34213,PS3,3,705.84,708.52,2.68,1.0,Or if you're going to install chips in people.
34213,PS3,3,708.6,709.32,0.72,2.0,Like Neuralink?
34213,PS3,3,709.96,715.24,5.28,1.0,"Yeah, just just make those chips eliminate the word from your from your brain."
34213,PS3,3,715.8,715.92,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34213,PS3,3,716.44,717.0,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, that's."

34213,PS3,3,718.76,720.24,1.48,1.0,"You will, You might say I don't know."
34213,PS3,3,720.24,720.76,0.52,1.0,Pardon.
34213,PS3,3,721.36,725.24,3.88,3.0,"But if you think about it, so this only happened to English speaking people, right?"
34213,PS3,3,729.12,729.48,0.36,3.0,So.
34213,PS3,3,729.68,730.56,0.88,2.0,That's a good question.
34213,PS3,3,730.56,731.04,0.48,2.0,I mean like.
34213,PS3,3,731.36,732.88,1.52,3.0,"If so, in in Spain."
34213,PS3,3,733.52,734.48,0.96,2.0,You maybe say yeah.
34213,PS3,3,734.48,736.36,1.88,1.0,"You would say school, bag school."
34213,PS3,3,736.48,736.68,0.2,2.0,Bag it.
34213,PS3,3,737.36,738.0,0.64,3.0,Doesn't work right.
34213,PS3,3,738.0,741.2,3.2,2.0,So the first thing we do?
34213,PS3,3,741.96,745.52,3.56,3.0,"Right, invent all the English speaking people to travel."
34213,PS3,3,745.52,746.8,1.28,1.0,Traveling on the world.
34213,PS3,3,747.92,749.16,1.24,3.0,So they don't spread it.
34213,PS3,3,749.48,750.0,0.52,2.0,"Oh, I like that."
34213,PS3,3,750.0,751.64,1.64,2.0,I like that reversal.
34213,PS3,3,751.64,753.44,1.8,2.0,But what are you going to do with the?
34213,PS3,3,753.84,754.04,0.2,1.0,People.
34213,PS3,3,754.04,755.0,0.96,1.0,English speaking people.
34213,PS3,3,756.8,757.16,0.36,3.0,Already.
34213,PS3,3,757.16,758.0,0.84,1.0,Living in that country.
34213,PS3,3,758.56,759.28,0.72,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34213,PS3,3,759.68,763.28,3.6,3.0,First thing we try to contend it to contain the problem.
34213,PS3,3,763.64,765.8,2.16,3.0,Don't let the English speaking people to travel.
34213,PS3,3,767.8,771.6,3.8,2.0,"Right, but we are not English speaking people."
34213,PS3,3,771.72,772.96,1.24,3.0,So and then the second problem.
34213,PS3,3,772.96,773.08,0.12,2.0,Right.
34213,PS3,3,773.24,774.0,0.76,2.0,"Sorry, sorry."
34213,PS3,3,774.56,774.8,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34213,PS3,3,774.8,780.28,5.48,3.0,And then Ben English speaking in non-english speaking country you can.
34213,PS3,3,780.56,783.12,2.56,1.0,"You can ban it, but people might use it."
34213,PS3,3,783.28,783.8,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34213,PS3,3,783.96,786.0,2.04,1.0,That's why I think the the bracelet.
34213,PS3,3,786.36,786.96,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, ban it."
34213,PS3,3,787.0,787.08,0.08,2.0,We.

34213,PS3,3,791.8,792.68,0.88,2.0,"It's about speed, right?"
34213,PS3,3,793.2,795.68,2.48,3.0,It's about speed because pandemic is very.
34213,PS3,3,795.88,797.12,1.24,1.0,One creative idea.
34213,PS3,3,797.12,797.28,0.16,1.0,One.
34213,PS3,3,797.72,798.96,1.24,2.0,"Creative idea, I think."
34213,PS3,3,799.52,804.28,4.76,2.0,"I think bannings, maybe English speaking country from trifling somewhere else would be great."
34213,PS3,3,806.04,808.96,2.92,2.0,"I like the place, yeah."
34213,PS3,3,809.44,814.04,4.6,3.0,"Yeah, if you pandemic, we try to to contain it first before."
34213,PS3,3,814.24,816.68,2.44,2.0,The free travel of all English speaking countries.
34213,PS3,3,818.76,824.84,6.08,3.0,"And then for the for the population in the English speaking country, then what should we do with that?"
34213,PS3,3,825.44,826.0,0.56,1.0,The president?
34213,PS3,3,826.6,827.36,0.76,1.0,That's creative.
34213,PS3,3,828.12,831.68,3.56,3.0,"Yeah, but how long to to to develop and?"
34213,PS3,3,832.4,833.44,1.04,1.0,Or maybe.
34213,PS3,3,833.56,839.96,6.4,2.0,"Well, I think, I think if you want to suppress society, I think it's easier than to develop society."
34213,PS3,3,839.96,849.0,9.04,2.0,"So if you want to make a bracelet that can suppress people to not do something, I think it will be far easier compared to if you want to enable society to do something actually."
34213,PS3,3,852.12,856.96,4.84,3.0,"Yeah, the the brace is good."

34213,PS3,3,865.16,866.64,1.48,2.0,"OK, so let's talk about the bracelet."
34213,PS3,3,867.12,870.32,3.2,2.0,Is it something wearable or is it something that is implemented so that?
34213,PS3,3,870.32,871.32,1.0,1.0,"You can, no, I think."
34213,PS3,3,871.32,872.72,1.4,2.0,"Neurologically, I."
34213,PS3,3,872.76,873.2,0.44,1.0,Think.
34213,PS3,3,873.28,873.52,0.24,2.0,Locking.
34213,PS3,3,875.92,876.32,0.4,3.0,I think.
34213,PS3,3,876.32,879.68,3.36,1.0,It's easier to put a bracelet than install it in a brain.
34213,PS3,3,880.12,880.48,0.36,2.0,OK.
34213,PS3,3,881.48,883.4,1.92,1.0,"But it's also not removable, right?"
34213,PS3,3,883.4,886.96,3.56,1.0,"At least for a time, until we're done with the pandemic."
34213,PS3,3,888.72,891.36,2.64,2.0,"OK, so how, how will this bracelet operate?"
34213,PS3,3,891.36,895.04,3.68,2.0,Is it something that will record your voice and whenever you.
34213,PS3,3,895.04,896.92,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, very close to sorry."
34213,PS3,3,897.04,897.64,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, so it."
34213,PS3,3,899.72,901.72,2.0,1.0,Will just give you like an electric shock and you will.
34213,PS3,3,902.52,907.88,5.36,3.0,"So let's let's, let's, let's do, let's, let's edit together so."
34213,PS3,3,908.6,908.92,0.32,2.0,Put.
34213,PS3,3,909.52,912.92,3.4,3.0,Give all the English speak English speaking people.
34213,PS3,3,913.32,914.16,0.84,2.0,A bracelet.
34213,PS3,3,917.92,921.96,4.04,3.0,So we can focus our effort to to manufacture the bracelet right?
34213,PS3,3,922.28,962.32,40.04,2.0,"Yeah, prevent, prevent for the same of sorry birth through through enabling electricity inducing bracelets that will add through electricity in this ring bracelets that will."
34213,PS3,3,963.56,964.44,0.88,3.0,If I took shop.
34213,PS3,3,965.32,998.48,33.16,2.0,And it will react toward falls through speech pattern that resemble the word sorry on English speaking concrete.
34213,PS3,3,1003.56,1004.2,0.64,1.0,Next.
34402,PS1,3,22.32,22.76,0.44,1.0,Elastic.
34402,PS1,3,22.76,23.36,0.6,2.0,Production.
34402,PS1,3,30.56,33.88,3.32,1.0,There is a lot of possible elections.
34402,PS1,3,34.96,37.48,2.52,1.0,What will be the most creative one?
34402,PS1,3,37.52,37.88,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
34402,PS1,3,38.4,40.68,2.28,3.0,The point is most of creative.
34402,PS1,3,41.16,41.48,0.32,1.0,Yes.
34402,PS1,3,45.8,47.96,2.16,3.0,We can come up with several ideas.
34402,PS1,3,47.96,48.48,0.52,2.0,Then we can.
34402,PS1,3,48.6,49.16,0.56,3.0,Evaluate.
34402,PS1,3,49.4,49.84,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
34402,PS1,3,49.96,50.28,0.32,1.0,OK.
34402,PS1,3,60.68,67.84,7.16,1.0,One common is to enforce a companies to to process in this.
34402,PS1,3,68.2,69.12,0.92,1.0,What's What's the name?
34402,PS1,3,69.12,71.28,2.16,2.0,Standard manufacturer EMR.
34402,PS1,3,71.6,72.72,1.12,1.0,"ERM, something like that."
34402,PS1,3,73.32,74.68,1.36,1.0,Enterprise responsibility.
34402,PS1,3,79.88,83.4,3.52,2.0,I think the most creative that I can think of is.
34402,PS1,3,85.68,86.56,0.88,1.0,Introduce.
34402,PS1,3,87.48,91.4,3.92,2.0,Attach a monetary value to plastic so people value it more.
34402,PS1,3,91.76,100.0,8.24,2.0,"Essentially, one of the reasons why there is so much pollution and people throw away plastic is because it's it's cheaper to manufacture."
34402,PS1,3,100.64,102.6,1.96,2.0,Cheaper to manufacture than to recycle.
34402,PS1,3,102.76,104.12,1.36,2.0,So people don't recycle.
34402,PS1,3,104.44,109.32,4.88,2.0,"Instead, they manufacture more in the case of plastic."
34402,PS1,3,109.76,111.64,1.88,1.0,"Oh, it's cheaper to produce, but expensive."
34402,PS1,3,111.68,112.68,1.0,2.0,To recycle.
34402,PS1,3,112.68,113.0,0.32,2.0,Oh yes.
34402,PS1,3,113.2,120.28,7.08,2.0,"So now if you say that you are not allowed to manufacture more or no, not allowed to produce more or every production."
34402,PS1,3,120.48,126.52,6.04,2.0,"So suppose production takes $1.00 and recycling takes $3.00, so people keep producing more instead of recycling."
34402,PS1,3,126.52,137.6,11.08,2.0,"But if you come up with a monetary penalty on producing new plastic, which is $2.00, now manufacturing and recycling is the same price, so people will recycle more."
34402,PS1,3,138.16,144.28,6.12,2.0,So basically create manufacture penalty for new plastic manufacturer and incentives.
34402,PS1,3,144.28,147.92,3.64,1.0,"For recycling, alright, I like the idea."
34402,PS1,3,147.92,151.44,3.52,1.0,"I mean, I think it's not super creative."
34402,PS1,3,151.48,156.64,5.16,1.0,"It's like this carbon fees, plastic fees, try to put fee in the production."
34402,PS1,3,157.0,157.92,0.92,1.0,But I like the idea.
34402,PS1,3,157.92,162.76,4.84,2.0,Well what happens once you do this is people will now use plastic as currency.
34402,PS1,3,163.6,175.28,11.68,2.0,"Like essentially in the long run, your every person should be able to get some plastic credit that as a person you have saved enough to be able to buy 20 KGS of plastic."
34402,PS1,3,175.4,177.04,1.64,2.0,"It's like carbon credits, yes."
34402,PS1,3,177.12,179.76,2.64,2.0,So come up with the concept of plastic credits that you have to.
34402,PS1,3,180.2,188.12,7.92,2.0,"So if I if I save say 2 KGS of plastic over the course of a month and go and deposit in a recycling plant, they will give me two KG credit."
34402,PS1,3,188.52,193.76,5.24,2.0,"Now whenever I purchase something, it's essentially not only the money that I spent but also the plastic credit."
34402,PS1,3,194.04,201.16,7.12,2.0,"So if I run out of the credit say in 20 days, then for the next 10 days of the month I cannot buy anything which has plastic in it."
34402,PS1,3,201.88,202.24,0.36,1.0,I like it.
34402,PS1,3,202.24,202.56,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
34402,PS1,3,202.68,209.64,6.96,1.0,We could make like an app or a platform to to make this more engagement.
34402,PS1,3,209.64,217.64,8.0,1.0,"Like every person have their own app or their own code of how much plastic is recycled during the month, how much plastic ready they have."
34402,PS1,3,218.16,226.72,8.56,1.0,And we can make that old product has this AQR code saying how much plastic is going to going to save for recycling.
34402,PS1,3,226.72,235.56,8.84,1.0,That and try to engage stores or supermarkets to have these models of recycling.
34402,PS1,3,235.56,243.88,8.32,1.0,"So for example, you have your bottle of whatever of water you put your ER code or your code say how much are you going to send it throw away?"
34402,PS1,3,244.08,246.88,2.8,1.0,And that's go directly to your plastic account.
34402,PS1,3,247.92,253.72,5.8,2.0,"So next time you can then buy more plastic, but if you don't have any plastic then then you can still buy but at a higher."
34402,PS1,3,253.72,255.76,2.04,1.0,Cost higher Prof I like it.
34402,PS1,3,256.6,260.96,4.36,1.0,"So in this case, it will be not only a fee for the companies, also for the customers, right?"
34402,PS1,3,261.44,265.6,4.16,2.0,So at net net every month every human being will be 0 in plastic.
34402,PS1,3,265.84,268.28,2.44,2.0,They either compensate by paying monetarily.
34402,PS1,3,268.72,279.24,10.52,2.0,"So probably rich people are not going to go and recycle plastic, but they will have to pay more and that money that they pay more can be used for recycling plants to."
34402,PS1,3,279.4,279.88,0.48,1.0,Function.
34402,PS1,3,280.16,281.68,1.52,1.0,"OK, yes, I like it."
34402,PS1,3,281.68,286.12,4.44,1.0,"Yeah, I think we're creative, very dynamic."
34402,PS1,3,286.44,288.12,1.68,2.0,I'll just write this one down for now.
34402,PS1,3,344.48,344.6,0.12,1.0,None.
34402,PS1,3,347.92,355.12,7.2,3.0,So do you think the supermarket and stores are the places people buy the most plastic products?
34402,PS1,3,356.0,360.04,4.04,3.0,Or what is the usage for the plastic product?
34402,PS1,3,360.08,364.6,4.52,3.0,Is it for a plastic bag or a bottle of water?
34402,PS1,3,365.6,366.28,0.68,2.0,Or anything.
34402,PS1,3,366.44,374.24,7.8,2.0,"Anything that is plastic, so a packet of chips or biscuits and anything that has any plastic."
34402,PS1,3,374.24,381.2,6.96,2.0,"So all the ready made food that you get at get at Sainsbury's which has a plastic film at top, everything will be essentially."
34402,PS1,3,381.76,382.12,0.36,3.0,Plastic.
34402,PS1,3,382.32,389.12,6.8,3.0,So what about like the cookies they they originally has to have a plastic bag outside?
34402,PS1,3,389.64,390.88,1.24,2.0,So you can buy plastic.
34402,PS1,3,390.88,395.4,4.52,2.0,"We are not saying don't buy plastic, but you can only buy plastic once you recycle it."
34402,PS1,3,395.72,405.64,9.92,2.0,"So if you want to buy to see you want to buy a packet of cookies which has 10 grams of plastic wrapping, so you should have 10 grams credit in your plastic recycling."
34402,PS1,3,406.2,408.4,2.2,2.0,So you can then you are eligible to buy that.
34402,PS1,3,408.64,412.04,3.4,2.0,"If you don't have 10 grams credit, you pay a higher price for the plastic."
34402,PS1,3,413.56,416.16,2.6,3.0,"OK, so how can I recycle the plastic?"
34402,PS1,3,416.36,417.6,1.24,2.0,So you whatever plastic you.
34402,PS1,3,417.6,419.4,1.8,2.0,So you bought this packet of cookies.
34402,PS1,3,419.8,425.6,5.8,2.0,"Don't throw the plastic, instead collect it and go and deposit it at the proper location where recycling."
34402,PS1,3,425.6,427.0,1.4,3.0,Not inside the supermarket.
34402,PS1,3,427.36,430.2,2.84,2.0,"The supermarket could be the could be the location, they could have the kiosk."
34402,PS1,3,430.2,437.36,7.16,2.0,"So you could go to the supermarket, deposit 500 grams of plastic when you enter, and then you have 500 grams credit to do all your shopping."
34402,PS1,3,437.68,441.08,3.4,2.0,"And suppose you pick up only 400 grams, so 100 will be still pending."
34402,PS1,3,441.12,442.0,0.88,3.0,It's like a currency.
34402,PS1,3,442.04,449.92,7.88,2.0,It's like a currency and this currency will work on top of existing currencies so you can instead of by recycling.
34402,PS1,3,449.92,454.52,4.6,2.0,"You can pay £2 for a 1 LB item, so you are compensating for not recycling enough."
34402,PS1,3,457.0,468.92,11.92,1.0,Excess like the area and also this will affect rich people who doesn't care much about paying an extra fees for their plastic so they can still pay you more.
34402,PS1,3,474.2,475.56,1.36,1.0,This is a very good idea.
34402,PS1,3,476.08,477.4,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, it should be implemented."
34402,PS1,3,479.08,481.12,2.04,3.0,Open a company to do this.
34402,PS1,3,482.96,484.4,1.44,1.0,Next questions.
36316,PS4,3,6.2,12.44,6.24,1.0,"OK, sorry."
36316,PS4,3,18.04,23.12,5.08,1.0,"OK, so individualize academic."
36316,PS4,3,24.04,50.84,26.8,1.0,"No, that's not the right word into personalize academic resources to make them to marginalized groups."
36316,PS4,3,54.88,64.96,10.08,1.0,Translate into their own language and.
36316,PS4,3,64.96,67.04,2.08,2.0,More like public open exercise.
36316,PS4,3,67.32,80.04,12.72,1.0,"Yeah, explain content more thoroughly where needed."
36316,PS4,3,80.68,83.28,2.6,1.0,"OK, so you were saying Open Access?"
36316,PS4,3,85.16,85.44,0.28,2.0,More.
36316,PS4,3,85.96,93.56,7.6,1.0,"Open Access to public yeah, teacher training as well."
36316,PS4,3,96.04,111.2,15.16,1.0,"Well, like inclusion, inclusion, so inclusion in classrooms programs."
36316,PS4,3,117.52,126.48,8.96,1.0,I saying the mutually beneficial nature of it.
36316,PS4,3,128.32,129.44,1.12,1.0,"No, that's 4."
36316,PS4,3,131.44,136.2,4.76,1.0,"OK, One creative idea, because these are kind of like all obvious."
36316,PS4,3,136.2,142.48,6.28,1.0,So we have a marginalised group that is like here and then we have all the other ones who have the academic resources.
36316,PS4,3,142.48,144.48,2.0,1.0,So like I guess financial support as well.
36316,PS4,3,145.16,166.84,21.68,1.0,"That's what you need, financial, financial and I'd say and knowledge support for disadvantaged families and equal distribution."
36316,PS4,3,167.16,189.16,22.0,1.0,"So I guess design policies as well, design policies which would ensure more equal distribution of academic resources."
36316,PS4,3,191.28,195.56,4.28,1.0,"OK, what else?"
36316,PS4,3,196.12,199.64,3.52,1.0,An equity distributed academic resources.
36316,PS4,3,199.92,201.0,1.08,1.0,So academic resources.
36316,PS4,3,201.0,202.08,1.08,1.0,What can that be?
36316,PS4,3,202.56,208.0,5.44,1.0,I like technology books teacher.
36316,PS4,3,208.0,210.56,2.56,1.0,"Oh, so teachers into marginalized Arabs."
36316,PS4,3,210.56,210.92,0.36,1.0,I know.
36316,PS4,3,211.08,234.36,23.28,1.0,So get train in the officials from marginalised communities to become teachers and teach the marginalised groups in return.
36316,PS4,3,234.36,245.12,10.76,1.0,"I think that's an OK one because if you take a teacher from the marginalised community, they will, they will have the cultural, social, cultural like context."
36316,PS4,3,247.88,257.44,9.56,1.0,"They will have the social, cultural context."
36316,PS4,3,263.12,264.52,1.4,1.0,OK Anything else?
36316,PS4,3,267.0,270.84,3.84,1.0,"Surely there's something else teachers do, do do, do."

36316,PS4,3,313.88,325.8,11.92,1.0,"So I think that links to like Open Access, but so do you want me to add like maybe digitised content, ties to content?"
36316,PS4,3,328.2,341.96,13.76,1.0,"Let me put digitalised content, Yeah, I think that's good."
36316,PS4,3,349.72,362.2,12.48,1.0,"And here where, where were the policies which wouldn't ensure?"
36316,PS4,3,369.24,370.68,1.44,1.0,Academic resources.

36474,PS4,3,14.8,19.44,4.64,1.0,"Oh, OK."
36474,PS4,3,20.48,22.72,2.24,3.0,Problem like IELTS writing test.
36474,PS4,3,29.68,38.48,8.8,1.0,I feel like one thing that kind of exists both domestically and internationally is where like schools have partner schools.
36474,PS4,3,38.84,46.36,7.52,1.0,So a lot of time like a school in quite an affluent area or like maybe a private school has a has a kind of equivalent school that they're partnered with.
36474,PS4,3,46.68,49.8,3.12,1.0,But I don't know how you do that without it coming across a bit like but.
36474,PS4,3,49.96,66.04,16.08,3.0,"But actually, I mean, because you know, because my mum, she's a teacher and actually, you know, there is some regulations of frameworks in China is like for example, my mom, she's in a good school, is a higher quality school."
36474,PS4,3,66.04,88.92,22.88,3.0,"But sometimes teachers in this kind of high or good schools, they need to, you know, exchange with some, maybe they're in a lower or they're in a poor, more poor and less resources area schools, you know, this kind of they are become a partner, you know, and try to help each other."
36474,PS4,3,88.92,102.32,13.4,3.0,"So I think maybe we can, why one idea is like, we can, we can, we can push or speed up this kind of teacher exchange in different qualities levels."
36474,PS4,3,102.8,102.96,0.16,1.0,School.
36474,PS4,3,103.6,104.72,1.12,3.0,I think this is 1.
36474,PS4,3,105.16,106.56,1.4,3.0,"Oh yeah, yeah."
36474,PS4,3,107.04,108.12,1.08,1.0,Teacher exchange.
36474,PS4,3,108.24,108.92,0.68,1.0,"Yeah, that's a good."
36474,PS4,3,108.92,109.24,0.32,3.0,Idea.
36474,PS4,3,112.56,113.56,1.0,1.0,Other resources.
36474,PS4,3,115.32,120.52,5.2,2.0,"Academic resources, meaning like books and laptops and that kind of stuff."
36474,PS4,3,120.6,120.76,0.16,2.0,Do you?
36474,PS4,3,120.76,137.28,16.52,1.0,"Think maybe I suppose it's quite broad like because another thing with like if you think of like the really like expensive fancy pants private schools in the UK, like one of the huge things of their resources is like the network and stuff like that."
36474,PS4,3,137.68,142.4,4.72,1.0,Like the alumna and the people who come in who give guest speakers and things like that.
36474,PS4,3,142.4,150.6,8.2,1.0,And like that side of things compared to like a low income state school where they don't have those kind of role models.
36474,PS4,3,152.8,153.8,1.0,1.0,But I don't know.
36474,PS4,3,154.24,155.96,1.72,2.0,Overcome and.
36474,PS4,3,156.88,183.44,26.56,1.0,"Maybe it's, I don't know, is it, is it easier to do it like if you had came out with a scheme, would it be easier to do it like in one local area where there might be two schools that are different and then have like this sort of initiative of, of exchange between the schools where teachers could exchange for like terms, but you could also share like alumni networks and use this for sort of."
36474,PS4,3,183.72,184.6,0.88,2.0,Like joint events?
36474,PS4,3,184.72,184.88,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
36474,PS4,3,185.12,185.36,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS4,3,185.6,187.44,1.84,3.0,It's not just like teachers here.
36474,PS4,3,187.68,188.28,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, it's like it's."
36474,PS4,3,188.28,190.04,1.76,2.0,Just going to make sure that it's open to everyone.
36474,PS4,3,190.24,190.6,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36474,PS4,3,191.4,198.12,6.72,1.0,"Yeah, because I actually did something with college, like college has like a partner school and it's in like North East England."
36474,PS4,3,198.12,203.88,5.76,1.0,"And they asked if like anyone would want to give a online but like give a talk about science, right."
36474,PS4,3,204.12,214.16,10.04,1.0,"So I gave this talk, but it was interesting because it was a this one particular sixth form college, but they said that they had students from other schools like near it who were also there, which I thought was like interesting that they've gone."
36474,PS4,3,214.32,215.92,1.6,1.0,"We have this opportunity, but you can also kind."
36474,PS4,3,215.92,219.16,3.24,2.0,"Of remember that and especially if it's virtually like it's, it makes it so much more."
36474,PS4,3,219.68,220.2,0.52,1.0,Accessible.
36474,PS4,3,220.2,220.56,0.36,1.0,Accessible.
36474,PS4,3,220.6,222.56,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, OK, maybe we do something like that."
36474,PS4,3,222.56,227.96,5.4,1.0,"So, so set up an exchange."
36474,PS4,3,228.08,234.12,6.04,1.0,I'll put it in inverted commas because exchange programme.
36474,PS4,3,235.4,240.24,4.84,1.0,"Oh, wait, no, wait, I can't type."
36474,PS4,3,243.0,244.16,1.16,1.0,"Oh, that's really weird."
36474,PS4,3,244.16,245.28,1.12,1.0,It doesn't do the right thing.
36474,PS4,3,245.72,247.32,1.6,1.0,"Oh, I know it doesn't."
36474,PS4,3,247.32,248.32,1.0,1.0,"OK, I'm just going to do that."
36474,PS4,3,248.72,265.32,16.6,1.0,So I have an exchange program slash partnership scheme between scores in the same area but with different levels of resource.
36474,PS4,3,267.88,277.28,9.4,2.0,The exchange can include everything from educators to speakers and events.
36474,PS4,3,278.52,278.8,0.28,2.0,What?
36474,PS4,3,279.08,282.8,3.72,1.0,"Else speakers, events, etcetera."
36474,PS4,3,283.2,284.96,1.76,1.0,So for example.
36474,PS4,3,285.88,286.44,0.56,2.0,Trips.
36474,PS4,3,287.0,288.64,1.64,1.0,"Yeah, Oh yeah, yeah."
36474,PS4,3,288.64,290.76,2.12,1.0,"Events, school trips, etcetera."
36474,PS4,3,291.76,293.8,2.04,1.0,"School trips, etcetera."
36474,PS4,3,293.8,308.64,14.84,1.0,"For example, teachers could be encouraged to switch schools for a term slash academic year bracket, incentivized to do so."
36474,PS4,3,310.68,317.44,6.76,1.0,Some sort of incentive to do so would be like a qualification maybe or financial.
36474,PS4,3,317.96,329.52,11.56,1.0,"Yeah, with a financial incentive incentive or could earn a qualification by doing so."
36474,PS4,3,332.76,342.84,10.08,1.0,Other shared resources could include the alumni network network.
36474,PS4,3,343.32,361.84,18.52,1.0,So guest speaker events for example would will be hosted at both schools slash open to both to both student bodies to attend.
36474,PS4,3,364.0,366.36,2.36,1.0,"Yeah, to what I don't access."
36474,PS4,3,366.36,368.16,1.8,2.0,To alumni network to students.
36474,PS4,3,368.96,375.56,6.6,1.0,Access of alumni network to students.
36474,PS4,3,379.44,381.76,2.32,1.0,I like the school trip thing as well.
36474,PS4,3,384.6,400.2,15.6,2.0,"And I mean, like, could they like could hire, I don't know if for the schools who are doing this partnership either, could it be from the government or from the private schools, a subsidy that helps to make some of these outings more affordable, like if."
36474,PS4,3,400.2,400.4,0.2,1.0,You.
36474,PS4,3,401.2,416.16,14.96,2.0,"Opt into this, you get additional funding because you're you're doing so that's benefiting all students and therefore, if they're going to like if they're like further north and they want to come to London and you know, the cost of the bus is a lot like there's funding that's provided to help subsidise some of."
36474,PS4,3,416.16,419.76,3.6,1.0,"That yeah, we'll say that government funding I."
36474,PS4,3,420.0,420.28,0.28,2.0,Think so.
36474,PS4,3,420.56,421.24,0.68,1.0,"Probably, yeah."
36474,PS4,3,422.84,428.8,5.96,1.0,Government funding or alumni donations because that's a huge thing.
36474,PS4,3,428.8,439.2,10.4,1.0,Alumni donations could be used to subsidise the scheme and limit financial barriers.
36474,PS4,3,439.32,440.4,1.08,2.0,"No, I'm curious as to like."
36474,PS4,3,443.0,444.52,1.52,1.0,What AI would say about this Yeah.
36474,PS4,3,444.52,454.4,9.88,1.0,And I should remember and type it into ChatGPT and see what or like and see what it says or like do different programs and see like what DeepSeek would come up with and instead I'll be.
36474,PS4,3,454.4,455.52,1.12,2.0,"Interested, Have you tried DeepSeek?"
36474,PS4,3,455.96,456.64,0.68,1.0,"No, I haven't."
36474,PS4,3,456.64,456.88,0.24,1.0,Yes.
36474,PS4,3,457.04,457.36,0.32,1.0,Have you?
36474,PS4,3,457.52,457.84,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
36474,PS4,3,458.0,458.28,0.28,1.0,But it's.
36474,PS4,3,458.92,460.0,1.08,3.0,Easy to break up.
36474,PS4,3,460.56,461.0,0.44,1.0,"Oh, is it?"
36474,PS4,3,461.0,461.24,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS4,3,461.36,463.16,1.8,3.0,Because sometimes it's very congestion.
36474,PS4,3,463.16,467.08,3.92,3.0,"If you want, if you ask several questions, you're only the first two questions."
36474,PS4,3,467.2,467.32,0.12,3.0,It's.
36474,PS4,3,467.32,467.6,0.28,2.0,OK.
36474,PS4,3,467.6,468.8,1.2,2.0,"And then it's, yeah, too much."
36474,PS4,3,469.68,469.96,0.28,1.0,OK.
36474,PS4,3,470.28,471.0,0.72,1.0,Should you roll with that?
36474,PS4,3,471.08,471.6,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
36474,PS4,3,471.6,471.92,0.32,1.0,Cool.
35836,PS4,6,2.48,3.32,0.84,1.0,That's occasional.
35836,PS4,6,25.02,25.38,0.36,2.0,OK.
35836,PS4,6,26.18,31.06,4.88,2.0,So I guess first we've got to decide sort of parameters.
35836,PS4,6,31.06,34.54,3.48,2.0,"Is this country, is this area, is this globally?"
35836,PS4,6,35.38,39.24,3.86,2.0,"I guess, you know, we start thinking about all sorts of things come."
35836,PS4,6,39.24,43.8,4.56,1.0,Up with Isn't there like some sort of general question instead of like restriction to a specific poetry?
35836,PS4,6,44.16,44.36,0.2,2.0,OK.
35836,PS4,6,47.08,51.8,4.72,3.0,"Or is it like to the people with disability for example, someone cannot wait?"
35836,PS4,6,52.0,52.4,0.4,2.0,And.
35836,PS4,6,53.28,59.68,6.4,3.0,Like all like resources are just texts so probably people need podcasts as well.
35836,PS4,6,59.68,61.52,1.84,3.0,Like depends.
35836,PS4,6,61.52,68.08,6.56,3.0,"Like for example someone immersive like audios, texts."
35836,PS4,6,68.56,68.72,0.16,1.0,Like.
35836,PS4,6,70.12,85.84,15.72,2.0,"Yeah, or, or does it mean, you know, in, you know, developed countries everyone has to go to school by law, you know, from the till the age of 16 or 18, whereas in other countries that's definitely not the case."
35836,PS4,6,86.44,88.12,1.68,1.0,But that's like a creative idea.
35836,PS4,6,88.12,96.4,8.28,1.0,"It's something like everyone is doing like the UK or or China or US, They all force like, students to go to education like this."
35836,PS4,6,97.8,99.32,1.52,1.0,What kind of creative idea?
35836,PS4,6,99.56,106.36,6.8,1.0,"OK, Like it's hard to come."
35836,PS4,6,106.36,107.84,1.48,2.0,Up with What do they mean by creative?
35836,PS4,6,108.24,108.6,0.36,1.0,Something.
35836,PS4,6,108.88,112.68,3.8,1.0,"Well, I guess there's something others haven't done before, Yes."
35836,PS4,6,112.76,114.56,1.8,1.0,"Or not widely applied, yeah."
35836,PS4,6,119.48,121.68,2.2,3.0,So what's the problem first here?
35836,PS4,6,121.68,125.12,3.44,3.0,Like just.
35836,PS4,6,127.32,129.76,2.44,1.0,You need to have equal distribution of academic resources.
35836,PS4,6,129.96,130.28,0.32,2.0,OK.
35836,PS4,6,130.96,144.44,13.48,4.0,"Well, I guess it depends what you think disadvantaged marginalized groups are, because if it's sort of, you know, if you're looking at economic inequality and people with less resources and less access to education, that would be 1 policy proposal."
35836,PS4,6,144.44,150.48,6.04,4.0,"But then if you're talking about sort of disabled people and people with special educational needs, that's another problem."
35836,PS4,6,152.04,152.56,0.52,1.0,Yes.
35836,PS4,6,155.8,160.96,5.16,1.0,So it's hard to define even the parameter of disadvantage or marginalisation.
35836,PS4,6,162.52,171.48,8.96,5.0,There is a time limit I I suggest we each of us think of idea and in 3 or 4 minutes and discuss which one is the best.
35836,PS4,6,171.92,172.8,0.88,1.0,"To to write, Yeah."
35836,PS4,6,173.8,173.92,0.12,5.0,OK.
35836,PS4,6,174.4,175.76,1.36,1.0,You can go first.
35836,PS4,6,175.8,183.68,7.88,5.0,So I will at the same time and then in 3 minutes and then we're going to talk which one is the best so we can answer it.
35836,PS4,6,187.28,191.08,3.8,5.0,"So, so we discussed like in 5 minutes."
35836,PS4,6,191.16,193.16,2.0,5.0,5:00 OK 5.
35836,PS4,6,193.68,194.48,0.8,4.0,Winter here is 5.
35836,PS4,6,195.08,195.96,0.88,5.0,"Yeah, winter is 5."
35836,PS4,6,196.52,196.68,0.16,4.0,And.
35836,PS4,6,208.98,210.54,1.56,2.0,Do you want to do it in pairs perhaps?
35836,PS4,6,211.9,215.9,4.0,5.0,"Instead you can I, I I just need to talk to two weeks think."
35836,PS4,6,232.56,232.6,0.04,1.0,I.
35836,PS4,6,340.21,340.33,0.12,1.0,None.
35836,PS4,6,365.64,365.76,0.12,1.0,None.
35836,PS4,6,421.84,422.16,0.32,2.0,OK.
35836,PS4,6,427.2,427.8,0.6,3.0,You understand?
35836,PS4,6,428.0,429.8,1.8,2.0,"Yeah, mine."
35836,PS4,6,429.84,440.04,10.2,2.0,"I just thought obviously schools all need funding in order to pay their staff and you know, provide things for that students."
35836,PS4,6,440.04,443.44,3.4,2.0,So I thought you could offer like an incentive scheme where?
35836,PS4,6,443.8,444.32,0.52,4.0,You.
35836,PS4,6,445.04,452.28,7.24,2.0,The government gives more money for better results in certain groups that you've identified as being disadvantaged or marginalized.
35836,PS4,6,452.68,459.92,7.24,2.0,"So then they've got an incentive to, you know, provide more resources in order to get the results, in order to get the funding."
35836,PS4,6,462.6,463.16,0.56,2.0,That's my idea.
35836,PS4,6,466.2,478.96,12.76,4.0,"I was thinking if we're talking about the distribution of academic resources, maybe you could be looking at some kind of public store of kind of educational courses resources."
35836,PS4,6,478.96,479.8,0.84,5.0,Textbooks.
35836,PS4,6,480.16,488.36,8.2,4.0,"Something like the Open University, but on a bigger level and free, that's kind of accessible to everyone."
35836,PS4,6,491.4,505.64,14.24,3.0,"My thoughts were like to make a group of disadvantaged and marginalized, like groups like out of like 2010 people and like, and, and give them like enough resources."
35836,PS4,6,505.64,516.8,11.16,3.0,"So, and if they reach like some of like academic merits, like they're going to get like professors also going to get like bonuses and stuff."
35836,PS4,6,516.8,522.16,5.36,3.0,So it's going to be like motivation to give them.
35836,PS4,6,522.4,524.88,2.48,2.0,"Sort of similar to my one, but actual."
35836,PS4,6,525.36,525.64,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35836,PS4,6,525.72,526.88,1.16,2.0,"They have their own groups, yeah."
35836,PS4,6,527.52,528.04,0.52,3.0,With like.
35836,PS4,6,528.44,529.68,1.24,2.0,"Bonuses, yeah."
35836,PS4,6,530.2,539.0,8.8,1.0,And more like feel that we can actually focus on the academic resources like some kind of democratisation like the democracy of the academic resources that we can get in touch with.
35836,PS4,6,539.0,554.36,15.36,1.0,"For example, with the intelligence exploding with AI, that could possibly lack AI to become to be the deliverer like the delivery medium of this academic resources, which has a very low marginal cost."
35836,PS4,6,555.4,556.16,0.76,1.0,That's my idea.
35836,PS4,6,559.04,574.88,15.84,6.0,I think we should promote the students from from different countries or or regions to do more communication.
35836,PS4,6,578.72,588.84,10.12,6.0,It aims to share or exchange the education resources.
35836,PS4,6,588.84,591.12,2.28,6.0,So that's my idea.
35836,PS4,6,594.28,595.72,1.44,5.0,I think we can.
35836,PS4,6,596.88,600.56,3.68,5.0,First we should narrow the definition of disadvantaged groups.
35836,PS4,6,600.8,604.92,4.12,5.0,"So I in in my opinion, I narrowed it to poor and rich."
35836,PS4,6,604.96,621.52,16.56,5.0,I narrowed in the country so the government should do something and I think they could like to set up a scheme to give everyone electronic storage devices with books and documentaries to hand out to everyone.
35836,PS4,6,622.0,623.68,1.68,5.0,I think government can afford it.
35836,PS4,6,623.68,623.88,0.2,5.0,I.
35836,PS4,6,624.84,626.64,1.8,2.0,Think we've got 2 sort of main ideas.
35836,PS4,6,626.64,628.52,1.88,2.0,The government is definitely getting involved.
35836,PS4,6,629.28,632.92,3.64,2.0,"Do we want to go with the open, you know?"
35836,PS4,6,634.0,634.36,0.36,5.0,Open Access.
35836,PS4,6,634.72,638.48,3.76,2.0,"Yeah, Open Access information or the incentive scheme, I guess."
35836,PS4,6,640.0,643.48,3.48,4.0,I'm conscious we've got 80 seconds to write this up in.
35836,PS4,6,647.4,651.72,4.32,4.0,Should we go with sort of tagging the most points in from around the table?
35836,PS4,6,651.8,656.72,4.92,4.0,"Like sort of AI Open Access, government resources?"
35836,PS4,6,657.24,657.4,0.16,5.0,Yeah.
35836,PS4,6,661.36,661.64,0.28,1.0,Thank you.
35836,PS4,6,662.56,665.08,2.52,1.0,So AI sorry what?
35836,PS4,6,666.08,677.8,11.72,2.0,Just like the government would provide an Open Access resource incorporating AI to deliver educational resources free of charge that.
35836,PS4,6,677.8,678.24,0.44,1.0,We use.
35836,PS4,6,703.12,703.76,0.64,2.0,I guess we won't.
35836,PS4,6,704.64,707.88,3.24,1.0,And remember and.
35836,PS4,6,710.04,716.04,6.0,2.0,Free free of charge for all disadvantaged groups to use.
35801,PS4,6,1.36,1.64,0.28,1.0,OK.
35801,PS4,6,35.19,38.31,3.12,1.0,Do we have Thomas to ask this question or we have multiple?
35801,PS4,6,39.63,39.95,0.32,2.0,Questions.
35801,PS4,6,39.95,44.27,4.32,2.0,I think it's 12 for this OK is my understanding.
35801,PS4,6,44.35,44.75,0.4,3.0,"Yeah, I."
35801,PS4,6,44.91,45.15,0.24,2.0,Agree.
35801,PS4,6,75.62,78.14,2.52,3.0,So do people have any ideas?
35801,PS4,6,79.54,80.18,0.64,3.0,Anything?
35801,PS4,6,84.86,89.7,4.84,3.0,I think we should come up with just one creative idea instead of multiple SO.
35801,PS4,6,89.94,93.5,3.56,2.0,"Yeah, it says like, like we'll have one to submit."
35801,PS4,6,95.44,96.72,1.28,1.0,But it has to be created.
35801,PS4,6,97.04,97.88,0.84,2.0,"Yeah, that's the thing."
35801,PS4,6,97.88,99.28,1.4,2.0,Like that's what I'm thinking about policy.
35801,PS4,6,99.36,102.48,3.12,1.0,"All legal things, but it's not."
35801,PS4,6,103.24,103.88,0.64,4.0,"Created, But what?"
35801,PS4,6,103.88,106.16,2.28,4.0,What do they mean in quality in education?
35801,PS4,6,106.68,109.2,2.52,4.0,There is no in quality in education.
35801,PS4,6,110.84,117.92,7.08,2.0,"I think, well, I guess they defined it as like the idea that not everyone has the same access to resources."
35801,PS4,6,117.92,129.72,11.8,2.0,"So maybe like us at this university versus someone else at a different university in a different country, we might not have the same access to teaching quality resources, libraries, maybe those sorts of things."
35801,PS4,6,129.96,130.08,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
35801,PS4,6,130.12,132.48,2.36,4.0,But it also can mean that inequality.
35801,PS4,6,132.64,146.96,14.32,4.0,"I mean within educational environment there might be some inequality between, for example levels, class of people or races or something like that."
35801,PS4,6,147.52,147.84,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS4,6,147.88,154.0,6.12,2.0,I guess like we can just use the definition that they've given because obviously there's inequality at different levels.
35801,PS4,6,154.44,157.08,2.64,2.0,There's like a broad range of issues within inequality.
35801,PS4,6,157.08,164.88,7.8,2.0,"But the specific one that we would be targeting here is access to resources for education, OK."
35801,PS4,6,165.0,172.28,7.28,4.0,I guess so I to overcome the inequality in education.
35801,PS4,6,172.36,182.92,10.56,4.0,"In my opinion, I mean like in Cuba for example, education is free for everyone, all the people."
35801,PS4,6,185.0,186.36,1.36,4.0,I'm just giving you an example like.
35801,PS4,6,186.68,198.44,11.76,1.0,"Even it's free, for example, within one country, there are some rural areas that the resources like the teachers, the qualities of the teachers, even though the students have free access."
35801,PS4,6,198.76,206.24,7.48,1.0,"But I mean compare with the the big cities and the rural areas, they're having different level of."
35801,PS4,6,208.04,211.76,3.72,5.0,You will still be paid for conduction and not everyone has access for.
35801,PS4,6,212.04,213.36,1.32,4.0,"Condition fees, yeah."
35801,PS4,6,214.32,216.0,1.68,2.0,Mobility is also a factor.
35801,PS4,6,216.8,224.36,7.56,2.0,"If you live in an area where it's hard for you to travel, that could also be a reason why you don't have access, even if it's free."
35801,PS4,6,225.76,237.96,12.2,6.0,"For example, I think using the the power of the country to try to maybe minimize the educational inequality as an example of a methods to overcome this inequality."
35801,PS4,6,238.64,245.36,6.72,6.0,So I think maybe we should come up with some more noble or more new creative ideas.
35801,PS4,6,245.8,246.08,0.28,2.0,"Well, I."
35801,PS4,6,246.28,249.96,3.68,6.0,Mean this idea is kind of like very typical or traditional idea.
35801,PS4,6,252.0,252.2,0.2,4.0,Yeah.
35801,PS4,6,253.72,262.04,8.32,2.0,"Well, so I think the mind like I don't think the idea has to be something that particularly like solves the problem entirely."
35801,PS4,6,262.04,263.76,1.72,2.0,We can focus on one aspect of the problem.
35801,PS4,6,263.76,272.36,8.6,2.0,"So for example, we mentioned like rural areas, we could come up with maybe one creative idea that targets that specific cause of inequality."
35801,PS4,6,273.44,281.08,7.64,2.0,So we can narrow it down to what problem we want to solve and then come up with a a creative idea for that.
35801,PS4,6,281.08,284.24,3.16,2.0,Maybe like that could be an approach to solving this problem.
35801,PS4,6,286.48,290.68,4.2,6.0,What comes to my mind is using AI in modern days.
35801,PS4,6,291.08,291.52,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS4,6,292.08,300.56,8.48,6.0,It's very helpful to use transitivity guiding AI to help students know.
35801,PS4,6,302.44,307.04,4.6,2.0,But then how would we achieve equal access to AI?
35801,PS4,6,307.72,311.16,3.44,6.0,Because actually equal access to AI is easier to achieve.
35801,PS4,6,311.16,314.44,3.28,6.0,Equal access to like 2 men teachers.
35801,PS4,6,315.8,316.08,0.28,2.0,Right.
35801,PS4,6,316.56,316.96,0.4,4.0,"Yeah, but."
35801,PS4,6,323.97,325.61,1.64,1.0,It's the problem that we were sorry.
35801,PS4,6,326.17,326.61,0.44,1.0,Sorry to.
35801,PS4,6,327.01,334.01,7.0,4.0,"Tell you, maybe you can find something in I mean to combine my example and this example."
35801,PS4,6,335.65,336.81,1.16,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35801,PS4,6,337.01,340.29,3.28,4.0,"I mean, I, I think my, the example that I showed is not guarantee."
35801,PS4,6,340.72,349.16,8.44,4.0,"We guarantee free education, but you cannot pay 100% perfect in terms of everything, the accommodation, the transportation."
35801,PS4,6,350.08,359.8,9.72,4.0,"So you know, the important is, I mean, the, the major charges is the, the university charges, right."
35801,PS4,6,359.88,363.36,3.48,4.0,"Transportation and the accommodation is, is, is a secondary thing."
35801,PS4,6,364.52,373.32,8.8,4.0,"But people do suffer a lot with the, with the, with the university fees on charges."
35801,PS4,6,374.12,386.04,11.92,4.0,"If it's free for everyone like in Cuba, you know, it's in this case they achieved a high level of equality in education."
35801,PS4,6,386.64,389.88,3.24,4.0,"It's not perfect, but it is, it is something."
35801,PS4,6,391.04,399.16,8.12,4.0,"And if we added the IAI level, they are you know, access and all that, so."
35801,PS4,6,402.08,420.24,18.16,1.0,"So to overcome the accommodation of the transportation, can we just like offer online, online courses or like do online university and then instead of doing it free, we can also provide some incentives of them to encourage them to in the courses."
35801,PS4,6,420.24,430.76,10.52,1.0,"Because for the marginalised groups, probably that's because of their the educational environment that they don't think the high level of education is important or essential."
35801,PS4,6,430.76,433.24,2.48,1.0,But if we do some like incentives.
35801,PS4,6,433.72,433.8,0.08,2.0,To.
35801,PS4,6,434.6,439.8,5.2,1.0,Promote the the study.
35801,PS4,6,439.8,440.8,1.0,2.0,Environments.
35801,PS4,6,441.28,447.36,6.08,1.0,And then the online form of the courses rather than the actual classroom.
35801,PS4,6,448.52,448.8,0.28,3.0,Right.
35801,PS4,6,449.0,457.36,8.36,3.0,I guess the online format is very important for the access to the different resources and the AI part is kind of for the interactive.
35801,PS4,6,457.48,458.08,0.6,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS4,6,458.08,462.0,3.92,2.0,And then we can incorporate the idea that it's free for everyone.
35801,PS4,6,462.76,464.96,2.2,2.0,"Yeah, Yeah, OK."
35801,PS4,6,470.6,483.04,12.44,2.0,"Are we saying that we want to make it mandatory because of the point that you raised about how people also like, one of the reasons why there's unequal access is that not everyone has an equal understanding of the, the importance of the Yeah, yeah."
35801,PS4,6,486.52,491.64,5.12,2.0,"So then in that case, is it like you have to, you have to get university education."
35801,PS4,6,492.48,497.68,5.2,2.0,"You can, if you can, you can access in person, but if you can't, then you can do it online."
35801,PS4,6,497.96,502.96,5.0,2.0,But the the main idea is that you're mandating education and you're offering a free online platform for that.
35801,PS4,6,502.96,503.08,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35801,PS4,6,503.08,505.4,2.32,1.0,We need to sort of like force them to do the the.
35801,PS4,6,506.52,513.72,7.2,2.0,"Course, yeah, OK is to mandate."
35801,PS4,6,514.08,514.92,0.84,2.0,Can someone help me?
35801,PS4,6,514.92,515.48,0.56,2.0,Like yeah.
35801,PS4,6,521.56,524.64,3.08,1.0,But are we saying that lend it or just encourage or like?
35801,PS4,6,527.04,527.12,0.08,5.0,We.
35801,PS4,6,527.2,528.16,0.96,4.0,Need to.
35801,PS4,6,530.0,531.72,1.72,5.0,Enforce it by law.
35801,PS4,6,532.56,537.28,4.72,5.0,Are we saying if you don't go to university then you would be legally prosecuted?
35801,PS4,6,537.64,538.48,0.84,5.0,Are we saying that?
35801,PS4,6,538.96,541.0,2.04,2.0,That's a bit that sounds a bit extreme.
35801,PS4,6,542.6,551.84,9.24,2.0,"Maybe we can just focus on the online aspect, because again, it's like solving two different problems which you might not be able to do with just one idea, so."
35801,PS4,6,554.08,554.4,0.32,1.0,Offer.
35801,PS4,6,556.04,556.4,0.36,2.0,Time.
35801,PS4,6,557.08,559.76,2.68,2.0,"Education, that is."
35801,PS4,6,560.04,564.0,3.96,1.0,That AI.
35801,PS4,6,566.04,575.96,9.92,2.0,"Teaching, like the purpose of AI is to essentially replace teachers so that everyone has the same access to teaching quality."
35801,PS4,6,587.68,588.32,0.64,2.0,What else?
35801,PS4,6,589.28,589.8,0.52,1.0,Is it free?
35801,PS4,6,589.96,591.28,1.32,1.0,Free online education.
35801,PS4,6,592.24,609.3,17.06,2.0,"Or is it yeah, and study the materials, maybe you could also say like stuff like libraries, online libraries and databases."
35801,PS4,6,616.46,618.06,1.6,2.0,Is there anything else we could add to this?
35801,PS4,6,624.0,625.08,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35801,PS4,6,625.72,627.12,1.4,2.0,Should I click next then?
35801,PS4,6,627.16,627.28,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34382,PS2,3,0.0,473.16,5.64,3.0,The reliabilities within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled cost.
34382,PS2,3,478.52,481.48,2.96,1.0,That sounds like the six link 6 Sigma thing.
34382,PS2,3,483.08,484.64,1.56,2.0,"Oh my God, it's all coming in."
34382,PS2,3,484.64,485.0,0.36,2.0,Let me.
34382,PS2,3,485.0,486.16,1.16,1.0,Type this time maybe?
34382,PS2,3,486.32,487.36,1.04,2.0,"OK, No, it's happening."
34382,PS2,3,487.48,487.68,0.2,2.0,No.
34382,PS2,3,488.2,489.12,0.92,1.0,"No, no, Let me."
34382,PS2,3,489.12,489.52,0.4,1.0,Let me.
34382,PS2,3,492.72,493.0,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
34382,PS2,3,494.32,495.24,0.92,3.0,"Yeah, now it's English."
34382,PS2,3,499.96,501.24,1.28,3.0,Two uncontrolled calls.
34382,PS2,3,501.48,501.68,0.2,1.0,And.
34382,PS2,3,506.44,506.88,0.44,3.0,So by.
34382,PS2,3,508.76,521.36,12.6,1.0,"1 So you can monitor everything by phase and who handles that, where is it inefficiency and you can also monitor."
34382,PS2,3,521.52,531.12,9.6,1.0,"There's also one thing except from blockchain, they are like a micro RFID, like a very, very small, cheap and very inexpensive."
34382,PS2,3,531.12,533.0,1.88,1.0,So you stick on each product.
34382,PS2,3,533.16,536.36,3.2,3.0,So then you can you can track it with GPS or something.
34382,PS2,3,536.64,539.76,3.12,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, indoor, indoor, infrared, all sorts of things."
34382,PS2,3,539.96,543.12,3.16,1.0,Or you can have like a time monitoring thing as well.
34382,PS2,3,549.56,550.04,0.48,2.0,That's nice.
34382,PS2,3,553.64,555.04,1.4,1.0,"That's right, but it depends."
34382,PS2,3,555.04,557.76,2.72,1.0,Like if your product is expensive then you can do it.
34382,PS2,3,558.08,577.53,19.45,1.0,"But let's say if it's like producing plastic, you wouldn't do it because it's not worth it commercially and micro RFID, something like that."
34382,PS2,3,587.76,591.84,4.08,2.0,"We, we actually studied a lot of different technologies, right and."
34382,PS2,3,592.6,593.12,0.52,1.0,OPS.
34382,PS2,3,594.44,595.6,1.16,2.0,What was the other one?
34382,PS2,3,596.88,599.44,2.56,2.0,"There was the RFID, and then there was one more technology."
34382,PS2,3,611.72,613.12,1.4,1.0,Hire more MBAs.
34382,PS2,3,613.12,617.6,4.48,1.0,Does that work?
34382,PS2,3,620.6,621.76,1.16,2.0,Definitely not.
34382,PS2,3,622.28,622.88,0.6,1.0,"No, OK."
34382,PS2,3,624.72,628.16,3.44,3.0,"I mean it's it's an indirect solution, but we."
34382,PS2,3,629.36,629.64,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
34382,PS2,3,631.52,633.44,1.92,3.0,We have to mention some specific.
34382,PS2,3,635.92,637.36,1.44,2.0,I'm feeling very sleepy guys.
34382,PS2,3,638.28,642.52,4.24,2.0,Somehow my brain is not draining.
34382,PS2,3,648.32,660.24,11.92,3.0,So there could be different kind of vulnerabilities and maybe having alternatives to the.
34382,PS2,3,660.56,666.88,6.32,3.0,"For example, if you have vulnerability in logistics, you can partner with multiple logistic partners."
34382,PS2,3,666.88,670.0,3.12,2.0,You can have like third party logistics.
34382,PS2,3,670.08,681.8,11.72,3.0,"And there is like sometimes it happens that the supplier, I mean having multiple supplier options if one can't produce and deliver maybe another financial difficulties, yes."
34382,PS2,3,682.76,686.36,3.6,2.0,You can also simultaneously ask for production from 2 to 3 suppliers.
34382,PS2,3,686.44,687.44,1.0,3.0,"Yeah, that too."
34382,PS2,3,690.24,692.84,2.6,1.0,Or maybe even don't have any suppliers at all.
34382,PS2,3,693.6,694.24,0.64,1.0,"I mean, I mean, I see."
34382,PS2,3,694.48,694.68,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS2,3,694.68,697.2,2.52,3.0,"Controlling in house maybe, yeah."
34382,PS2,3,697.88,699.08,1.2,1.0,Everything like Shein.
34382,PS2,3,699.08,700.2,1.12,1.0,They don't even own this.
34382,PS2,3,700.68,702.72,2.04,2.0,"But yeah, yeah, Shein."
34382,PS2,3,703.4,705.24,1.84,2.0,But they have like terrible working hours.
34382,PS2,3,705.24,705.88,0.64,2.0,Let's not talk.
34382,PS2,3,705.88,706.2,0.32,3.0,About it.
34382,PS2,3,706.2,707.56,1.36,3.0,They own their own production.
34382,PS2,3,708.12,708.6,0.48,3.0,They don't.
34382,PS2,3,708.6,709.2,0.6,3.0,"They don't, right?"
34382,PS2,3,709.24,709.8,0.56,3.0,They don't.
34382,PS2,3,710.04,710.28,0.24,2.0,So they.
34382,PS2,3,710.28,710.84,0.56,3.0,Work with those.
34382,PS2,3,711.48,714.24,2.76,2.0,"Yeah, multiple suppliers."
34382,PS2,3,714.24,720.36,6.12,2.0,Or you can also outsource your supply chain to a third party vendor.
34382,PS2,3,726.0,730.48,4.48,1.0,I guess it's like redistribute the risk where we where.
34382,PS2,3,730.48,741.84,11.36,3.0,"And also do a risk analysis of your like supply chain to identify the, I mean some, I mean, if you don't know what, where are those risks?"
34382,PS2,3,742.4,745.0,2.6,3.0,So I think risk assessment and then.
34382,PS2,3,770.21,784.13,13.92,3.0,"Reducing the supply chain, I mean it's one similar to what Matthew said, maybe like if it if it's a very long value chain, maybe you can reduce some steps to so that uncertainties will reduce."
34382,PS2,3,786.45,787.81,1.36,2.0,Eliminate steps.
34382,PS2,3,813.56,816.76,3.2,1.0,It's automation one even though it's.
34382,PS2,3,817.64,819.56,1.92,3.0,"Yeah, I think automation could be just."
34382,PS2,3,819.56,828.0,8.44,1.0,"Reduce the labour force so then it's more standardized in terms of everything so they will go on strike, for example."
34382,PS2,3,828.48,831.32,2.84,3.0,"Yeah, you can write this automation."
34382,PS2,3,839.0,839.04,0.04,2.0,Oh.
34382,PS2,3,861.4,861.6,0.2,3.0,My God.
34382,PS2,3,869.84,872.32,2.48,1.0,I think another thing will be the raw material.
34382,PS2,3,872.32,893.84,21.52,1.0,It's can be insecure so maybe we can do some like futures trade to secure the raw materials or have different just maintain a good relationship with the raw material supplier in general.
34382,PS2,3,894.64,896.44,1.8,1.0,Is it one of the possible idea?
34382,PS2,3,896.68,896.96,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS2,3,896.96,903.08,6.12,3.0,"So I mean hedging, using hedging to control the uncertainty."
34382,PS2,3,903.2,911.31,8.11,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34382,PS2,3,911.71,915.67,3.96,3.0,"Maybe you will just write like hedge, use hedging."
34382,PS2,3,918.64,922.28,3.64,3.0,So I think could be like for example.
34382,PS2,3,922.32,925.12,2.8,1.0,"Like oil and gas, like the price always fluctuate."
34382,PS2,3,925.16,925.88,0.72,1.0,Or orange even.
34382,PS2,3,926.36,926.88,0.52,2.0,Got that?
34382,PS2,3,927.2,933.04,5.84,1.0,So when you buy in advance for in the future to secure the.
34382,PS2,3,934.44,936.72,2.28,3.0,To reduce price risk or something raw material?
34382,PS2,3,947.04,948.8,1.76,3.0,Is it enough or should we do more?
34382,PS2,3,949.6,950.32,0.72,3.0,"Yeah, let's admit."
35213,PS6,3,7.12,25.16,18.04,1.0,"Interesting, I never thought of this before."
35213,PS6,3,35.52,36.8,1.28,2.0,Only one creative ID yeah.
35213,PS6,3,38.76,42.64,3.88,2.0,Should we make like something tools or campaign?
35213,PS6,3,43.08,44.32,1.24,2.0,Do you think what that kind of?
35213,PS6,3,44.8,45.12,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35213,PS6,3,45.84,47.04,1.2,1.0,So I was thinking about contest.
35213,PS6,3,48.16,48.52,0.36,2.0,Oh contest.
35213,PS6,3,48.56,48.6,0.04,2.0,Oh.
35213,PS6,3,49.96,50.08,0.12,3.0,But.
35213,PS6,3,51.04,52.0,0.96,1.0,But it's 20 minutes off.
35213,PS6,3,52.28,53.2,0.92,1.0,"It's quite long, yeah."
35213,PS6,3,59.16,59.28,0.12,3.0,So.
35213,PS6,3,59.32,59.52,0.2,2.0,They can.
35213,PS6,3,60.08,65.48,5.4,3.0,Create some of the products which can play the music in the shower and like the bubbles kind.
35213,PS6,3,66.96,67.04,0.08,2.0,Of.
35213,PS6,3,68.08,69.76,1.68,3.0,The vibe and the atmosphere.
35213,PS6,3,70.96,71.8,0.84,1.0,"Yes, I think that is quite."
35213,PS6,3,72.0,72.72,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, I think I."
35213,PS6,3,73.52,73.92,0.4,3.0,Don't know.
35213,PS6,3,74.84,78.44,3.6,1.0,"Yeah, I think you need that, right, in order to enjoy their time singing in the shower."
35213,PS6,3,78.44,80.4,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, especially for a prolonged view."
35213,PS6,3,80.44,80.56,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35213,PS6,3,80.96,81.68,0.72,2.0,Waterproof.

35213,PS6,3,92.2,92.48,0.28,3.0,Right.
35213,PS6,3,96.32,97.44,1.12,2.0,Now compete with the AI.
35213,PS6,3,104.16,104.92,0.76,1.0,Waterproof.
35213,PS6,3,108.24,108.92,0.68,3.0,Speaker.
35213,PS6,3,108.92,110.12,1.2,2.0,Or microphone.
35213,PS6,3,110.56,120.48,9.92,3.0,And Excel functions that can change the colour and the diffuser and some bubbles from your speaker or whatever you see.
35213,PS6,3,120.88,123.32,2.44,3.0,The louder you see the more bubbles it will generate.
35213,PS6,3,124.96,130.96,6.0,3.0,Or you think when you change your voice or tone or the music type the color of the speaker will change.
35213,PS6,3,131.0,134.48,3.48,3.0,Like they will flush to a different color if you change your volume or whatever.
35213,PS6,3,134.6,134.88,0.28,3.0,I don't.
35213,PS6,3,134.96,135.04,0.08,2.0,Know.
35213,PS6,3,135.68,136.04,0.36,2.0,Interesting.

35213,PS6,3,136.4,136.72,0.32,3.0,Functions.
35213,PS6,3,137.44,138.08,0.64,2.0,Like the weather?
35213,PS6,3,138.08,139.04,0.96,2.0,More coming if.

35213,PS6,3,141.28,143.08,1.8,3.0,"Therefore, yeah, something like that, right?"
35213,PS6,3,145.16,161.9,16.74,1.0,"Multiple functions as color, What other function that we can?"
35213,PS6,3,163.46,167.94,4.48,3.0,Lighting bubbles like a diffuser.
35213,PS6,3,182.28,185.32,3.04,2.0,And you can like change the music like karaoke karaoke.
35213,PS6,3,189.16,189.6,0.44,3.0,Karaoke.

35213,PS6,3,208.96,210.32,1.36,1.0,Is it the shower?

35452,PS6,3,58.82,63.94,5.12,1.0,"I'm just curious, seeing the shower for 20 minutes, isn't it too long?"
35452,PS6,3,84.88,86.28,1.4,2.0,Should we just make a creative?
35452,PS6,3,86.28,108.12,21.84,1.0,"Advertisements like we show that when people sing in the shower for more than 20 minutes and later when they come out or come out of the bathroom and they feel energized and they, they, they have a higher performance in the, the second day or they, they just report a higher life quality, something like that."
35452,PS6,3,110.52,112.32,1.8,1.0,"Well, but it's not really creative."
35452,PS6,3,112.44,112.68,0.24,1.0,I don't.
35452,PS6,3,113.4,118.68,5.28,3.0,"Yeah, I I do think that we we should let people know the benefit and."
35452,PS6,3,120.12,120.48,0.36,1.0,Also.
35452,PS6,3,121.8,126.6,4.8,3.0,Maybe keep talking about this and they like remember this.
35452,PS6,3,128.12,130.08,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, I do think this is approach."
35452,PS6,3,130.48,134.48,4.0,1.0,It's like priming people to think about this and make it more accessible.
35452,PS6,3,165.04,165.16,0.12,1.0,None.
35452,PS6,3,186.77,193.57,6.8,1.0,I'm so happy.
36489,PS1,6,0.04,0.2,0.16,1.0,Right.
36489,PS1,6,1.24,7.24,6.0,2.0,"OK, plastic waste is one of the biggest discretion environmental problems of our lifetime."
36489,PS1,6,7.24,7.4,0.16,1.0,Don't.
36489,PS1,6,7.4,8.28,0.88,2.0,Mentioned it one time.
36489,PS1,6,8.6,12.2,3.6,2.0,Please come up with one creative idea to use reduce plastic pollution.
36489,PS1,6,12.52,14.72,2.2,2.0,So plastic is 1.
36489,PS1,6,14.72,16.76,2.04,1.0,Problem with the environment blah blah blah.
36489,PS1,6,17.0,19.64,2.64,2.0,Come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic pollution.
36489,PS1,6,19.64,19.68,0.04,3.0,I.
36489,PS1,6,23.48,24.64,1.16,4.0,Think there are a lot of things.
36489,PS1,6,24.64,25.52,0.88,3.0,"Being done about that, is it an?"
36489,PS1,6,25.52,25.68,0.16,5.0,Area.
36489,PS1,6,26.88,30.88,4.0,6.0,Of maybe when you baby I tried to dispose in terms of.
36489,PS1,6,30.88,31.16,0.28,5.0,Burning.
36489,PS1,6,31.16,32.56,1.4,4.0,"No, no, not disposing them."
36489,PS1,6,32.56,33.2,0.64,4.0,We don't want people.
36489,PS1,6,33.52,36.04,2.52,2.0,"To use plastic make it expensive, yeah."
36489,PS1,6,36.92,37.24,0.32,4.0,Yeah.
36489,PS1,6,37.28,38.52,1.24,2.0,That's why make it expensive.
36489,PS1,6,38.8,39.48,0.68,1.0,"Yes, so that."
36489,PS1,6,40.92,41.04,0.12,4.0,This.
36489,PS1,6,42.28,42.88,0.6,2.0,"Incentivizes, yeah."
36489,PS1,6,42.88,44.56,1.68,2.0,"So people go to the alternative, yeah."
36489,PS1,6,45.6,46.2,0.6,1.0,Make it.
36489,PS1,6,46.48,46.88,0.4,2.0,Will but then.
36489,PS1,6,48.0,50.64,2.64,6.0,Those using a plastic just create that position.
36489,PS1,6,51.36,52.32,0.96,2.0,"That's not the, that's dispose."
36489,PS1,6,52.32,52.48,0.16,2.0,Don't.
36489,PS1,6,53.76,53.88,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36489,PS1,6,54.76,60.48,5.72,2.0,"So by the time it's very expensive when you buy it, you want to reuse it so you don't create environmental pollution."
36489,PS1,6,61.76,62.76,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36489,PS1,6,63.08,64.96,1.88,2.0,And then the people that can't even afford it will use.
36489,PS1,6,64.96,66.28,1.32,4.0,It look for alternatives.
36489,PS1,6,68.04,71.68,3.64,2.0,"OK, it will have changed it to."
36489,PS1,6,72.2,73.4,1.2,1.0,Think this is your language.
36489,PS1,6,76.96,77.2,0.24,2.0,The.

36489,PS1,6,91.84,97.68,5.84,1.0,Can be made made expensive.
36489,PS1,6,98.88,100.28,1.4,2.0,To dissuade.
36489,PS1,6,102.16,108.4,6.24,1.0,"Dissuade, purchase and encourage and encourage reuse."

36489,PS1,6,114.92,115.2,0.28,2.0,If you say.
36489,PS1,6,115.2,116.28,1.08,1.0,Recycling that means you're.
36489,PS1,6,116.28,117.68,1.4,2.0,Training to be for them to recycle like.
36489,PS1,6,118.08,118.52,0.44,4.0,Recyclable.
36489,PS1,6,120.12,120.56,0.44,2.0,Recyclable.

36489,PS1,6,123.12,124.92,1.8,4.0,"OK, I'm talking about using it by."
36489,PS1,6,125.0,129.8,4.8,2.0,"Yourself yes you have to use it by the time you buy it expensive, you won't buy them through it away for them to recycle who is."
36489,PS1,6,130.0,133.56,3.56,6.0,Who is making their purchase not expensive producer of BE developments?
36489,PS1,6,135.88,136.16,0.28,2.0,I think.

36489,PS1,6,139.32,140.24,0.92,1.0,"OK, the cost of classes."
36489,PS1,6,140.24,142.76,2.52,1.0,OK the true government legislation.
36489,PS1,6,143.16,144.8,1.64,1.0,Government should make laws.
36489,PS1,6,146.08,146.92,0.84,3.0,How do I put it I?
36489,PS1,6,148.56,149.24,0.68,1.0,Didn't know capital.
36489,PS1,6,149.24,149.96,0.72,1.0,"It's OK, We don't even."
36489,PS1,6,150.88,151.36,0.48,2.0,"Wait, the cost?"
36489,PS1,6,151.36,151.44,0.08,3.0,Of.
36489,PS1,6,151.44,151.8,0.36,2.0,Classes.
36489,PS1,6,153.2,153.48,0.28,6.0,Should be.
36489,PS1,6,154.8,155.4,0.6,2.0,Made expensive.
36489,PS1,6,156.04,160.32,4.28,1.0,Through government legislation to dissuade OK.
36489,PS1,6,160.32,160.44,0.12,5.0,Through.
36489,PS1,6,161.6,166.2,4.6,2.0,Government Legit the government go.
36489,PS1,6,166.2,167.24,1.04,1.0,"Down there, go."
36489,PS1,6,169.04,169.88,0.84,3.0,This a laptop.
36489,PS1,6,170.84,174.32,3.48,1.0,"It's annoying me, legislation."
36489,PS1,6,175.0,175.56,0.56,2.0,To district.
36489,PS1,6,175.56,177.28,1.72,1.0,Purchase and encourage reuse.
36489,PS1,6,178.64,179.0,0.36,3.0,Looks.
36489,PS1,6,179.0,179.24,0.24,1.0,Good.
36489,PS1,6,179.24,179.96,0.72,1.0,"Duh, this."
36489,PS1,6,180.28,180.6,0.32,4.0,Is the.
36489,PS1,6,183.24,183.92,0.68,1.0,Last one.
36489,PS1,6,184.04,184.96,0.92,2.0,"No, it's the yeah."
36196,PS1,6,1.6,4.88,3.28,1.0,"Oh, OK."
36196,PS1,6,14.64,15.84,1.2,1.0,There are so many though.
36196,PS1,6,19.92,26.32,6.4,2.0,"I think like creating a material that is cheaper could like really, yeah."
36196,PS1,6,27.36,30.64,3.28,2.0,How is it encourage people to to use that instead of plastic?
36196,PS1,6,30.64,32.56,1.92,2.0,Because plastic is probably super cheap.
36196,PS1,6,32.96,40.72,7.76,2.0,"But if it is something cheaper and with the same characteristic, then if you introduce again files for we use plastic."
36196,PS1,6,48.08,57.8,9.72,1.0,"I think, yeah, Now the issue is there is no material that is as like flexible and malleable and sturdy as like plastic at that price."
36196,PS1,6,57.8,58.28,0.48,1.0,So that's.
36196,PS1,6,58.28,60.24,1.96,3.0,Like the issue I.
36196,PS1,6,60.56,60.92,0.36,1.0,Think.
36196,PS1,6,61.48,68.36,6.88,4.0,There is a very same strategy that could reduce the plastic problem at once.
36196,PS1,6,68.84,78.96,10.12,4.0,"Corresponding with the previous question, let's say to remind public that there is a pandemic which will transmit and spread by means of plastic."
36196,PS1,6,82.0,82.68,0.68,4.0,"Oh, I."
36196,PS1,6,82.76,83.28,0.52,2.0,Think that's.
36196,PS1,6,83.72,83.92,0.2,4.0,That's.
36196,PS1,6,83.96,84.12,0.16,1.0,Wrong.
36196,PS1,6,84.36,84.8,0.44,1.0,That's insane.
36196,PS1,6,85.0,85.12,0.12,2.0,But.
36196,PS1,6,86.52,87.28,0.76,4.0,Entering your.
36196,PS1,6,87.32,95.4,8.08,1.0,"Heart your Oh yeah true true actually, like micro plastics enter like our food and stuff yeah so promoting an anti fat can."
36196,PS1,6,97.56,98.4,0.84,2.0,"Bring to a human body, yeah."
36196,PS1,6,98.68,102.4,3.72,5.0,Don't necessarily stop using it because it's cheap like people value.
36196,PS1,6,102.92,103.4,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, like people."
36196,PS1,6,105.04,105.76,0.72,5.0,Don't know.
36196,PS1,6,106.36,110.72,4.36,2.0,"You get off that part, yeah, but if you introduce a lot of fines, then they're not the cheapest option."
36196,PS1,6,110.72,110.84,0.12,2.0,But.
36196,PS1,6,111.48,112.88,1.4,5.0,What else do people don't like?
36196,PS1,6,113.36,114.96,1.6,5.0,Like can we go hardship and fines?
36196,PS1,6,116.2,116.56,0.36,5.0,I don't know.
36196,PS1,6,118.84,120.24,1.4,3.0,'Cause I think maybe some like.
36196,PS1,6,120.72,121.44,0.72,1.0,Enormous like.
36196,PS1,6,121.56,126.56,5.0,3.0,"Me calculating OK, the fines are this much, but if I use plastic it's this much, it's actually so deeper."
36196,PS1,6,126.56,128.32,1.76,3.0,Do we find and use the plastic?
36196,PS1,6,129.6,131.44,1.84,2.0,If it's implemented by the government.
36196,PS1,6,131.64,143.76,12.12,2.0,"So if there are real like care costs due to plastic, then the government wants to like subsidized other material and make them cheaper than plastic."
36196,PS1,6,144.0,148.04,4.04,1.0,I think also the issue right is like we can't really get rid of all the.
36196,PS1,6,148.04,151.24,3.2,3.0,Plastics at the moment because like we don't have a substitute.
36196,PS1,6,152.08,152.6,0.52,1.0,I think.
36196,PS1,6,152.68,159.12,6.44,3.0,"Right, like what Trump is banning, like plastic banning paper straws or something because yeah, yeah, yeah."
36196,PS1,6,159.12,159.4,0.28,3.0,So.
36196,PS1,6,160.76,162.24,1.48,1.0,I don't know what's happening.
36196,PS1,6,165.44,168.76,3.32,3.0,"I think with the like, like bringing up the negative health effects."
36196,PS1,6,169.48,173.16,3.68,1.0,"Might be a good idea to reduce, but then like if we."
36196,PS1,6,173.16,176.2,3.04,3.0,"Fine, then people might get like really angry."
36196,PS1,6,177.16,178.48,1.32,3.0,"There's we don't have other, Yeah."
36196,PS1,6,178.72,192.12,13.4,2.0,"Maybe not OK, like the government subsidized the alternative so that this alternative is cheaper thanks to the government without fine, without introducing fines."
36196,PS1,6,193.92,197.4,3.48,5.0,So what happens when a new government comes in and and scraps that whole policy?
36196,PS1,6,198.44,199.4,0.96,3.0,We we see it in our.
36196,PS1,6,200.96,238.24,37.28,1.0,"Yeah, how we do it the opposite way, we charge more tax for the raw material making process, then that would make the price for plastic go higher."
36196,PS1,6,241.12,250.24,9.12,2.0,"Yeah, but I think it's kind of the same problem because then like people would get angry as well, I think, or not."
36196,PS1,6,251.04,252.12,1.08,1.0,But then that would force.
36196,PS1,6,252.4,260.88,8.48,1.0,"But that would force them to actually use the substitute, because then it's not on us anymore."
36196,PS1,6,260.88,263.6,2.72,1.0,"It's on the companies to try to solve the issue, right?"
36196,PS1,6,263.64,266.08,2.44,1.0,Then it's not on the consumers who have no choice but to buy it.
36196,PS1,6,266.92,270.6,3.68,1.0,But it will be on the companies to do more research on other materials.
36196,PS1,6,270.88,272.56,1.68,1.0,"Because right now they have no incentive, right?"
36196,PS1,6,272.84,274.48,1.64,1.0,They have no incentive to use other materials.
36196,PS1,6,274.48,275.56,1.08,1.0,"They're like, yeah, I think you're right."
36196,PS1,6,276.84,283.28,6.44,1.0,"But then now for as consumers, they were like, OK, this is a bit cheaper than plastic, so we can buy that."
36196,PS1,6,283.64,285.32,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, that could work actually."
36196,PS1,6,285.44,288.52,3.08,2.0,"It's OK, a lot of fines on the producer of plastic."
36196,PS1,6,288.64,291.68,3.04,1.0,"Not fines, but maybe like another term."
36196,PS1,6,291.68,292.84,1.16,1.0,I think that's.
36196,PS1,6,292.84,292.96,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36196,PS1,6,292.96,293.08,0.12,1.0,OK.
36196,PS1,6,293.44,294.36,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
36196,PS1,6,294.52,296.64,2.12,1.0,"So there, that might work actually."
36196,PS1,6,297.88,298.44,0.56,1.0,Should we do that?
36196,PS1,6,298.84,300.44,1.6,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36196,PS1,6,300.44,302.36,1.92,1.0,So what is the correct term for it?
36196,PS1,6,303.16,304.12,0.96,1.0,Is it tax?
36196,PS1,6,304.6,305.56,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, I think that's it."
36196,PS1,6,305.56,306.48,0.92,1.0,What's the correct tax?
36196,PS1,6,306.96,312.96,6.0,1.0,Plastic tax is it implement is.
36196,PS1,6,313.0,331.4,18.4,1.0,"I keep using the word implement plastic taxes on companies, manufacturers, companies and manufacturers."
36196,PS1,6,334.88,336.4,1.52,5.0,"People like free things, don't they?"
36196,PS1,6,336.88,337.48,0.6,1.0,They like what?
36196,PS1,6,337.52,338.2,0.68,1.0,Free things?
36196,PS1,6,338.32,338.76,0.44,1.0,Oh yeah.
36196,PS1,6,338.76,339.24,0.48,1.0,So like.
36196,PS1,6,339.72,340.64,0.92,2.0,Maybe.
36196,PS1,6,341.08,348.52,7.44,5.0,"Because my favorite is that even if you tax producers, they like pass on their higher costs to consumers, like everyday people."
36196,PS1,6,348.68,355.92,7.24,5.0,So maybe like the government could like give people like alternative of like plastic.
36196,PS1,6,356.12,359.16,3.04,5.0,"I know containers, cups and stuff for free in a sense."
36196,PS1,6,360.2,361.84,1.64,5.0,"I mean, that would cost a lot of money."
36196,PS1,6,361.84,364.44,2.6,5.0,But the goal here is to be creative.
36196,PS1,6,364.92,366.56,1.64,1.0,"Yeah, they never said we have like."
36196,PS1,6,367.88,368.0,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36196,PS1,6,369.68,371.0,1.32,3.0,Is that creator right?
36196,PS1,6,371.64,398.74,27.1,1.0,"OK, so on companies to OK, so encourage them to to encourage them to find alternative materials, find alternative materials to plastic."
36196,PS1,6,402.48,414.28,11.8,1.0,"Does that even make sense to encourage them to find alternative, find materials that can substitute that would substitute."
36196,PS1,6,422.91,445.32,22.41,1.0,"Please change my wording if it's wrong to conduct research on to use materials that was that could substitute ten Yeah, but then you said free."
36196,PS1,6,445.68,451.4,5.72,1.0,But then we'll be giving what the free non plastic items.
36196,PS1,6,451.6,454.84,3.24,1.0,"Yes, OK."
36196,PS1,6,454.84,454.92,0.08,1.0,Or.
36196,PS1,6,456.24,459.24,3.0,5.0,Maybe like giving out credits or something to households?
36196,PS1,6,460.28,461.04,0.76,2.0,Credits.
36196,PS1,6,461.12,463.2,2.08,1.0,Like like.
36196,PS1,6,463.2,469.8,6.6,5.0,Tokens and stuff that they can go and get like like household items that are not like plastic.
36196,PS1,6,469.8,470.04,0.24,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36196,PS1,6,470.28,470.92,0.64,2.0,Like coupons for?
36196,PS1,6,470.96,471.72,0.76,4.0,"Yeah, I think it's a good."
36196,PS1,6,473.88,478.04,4.16,6.0,"Yeah, like you bring plastic for recycling, for recycling and you get."
36196,PS1,6,478.48,478.96,0.48,2.0,Coupons.
36196,PS1,6,480.48,481.44,0.96,6.0,For a permanent.
36196,PS1,6,482.92,485.12,2.2,1.0,Option bringing in coupons?
36196,PS1,6,485.16,485.48,0.32,1.0,No.
36196,PS1,6,485.68,486.04,0.36,1.0,Who's giving?
36196,PS1,6,486.84,490.12,3.28,1.0,The government can give out coupons.
36196,PS1,6,490.88,492.6,1.72,5.0,To households.
36196,PS1,6,497.56,498.56,1.0,1.0,Giving out.
36196,PS1,6,499.08,499.84,0.76,1.0,Oh wait.
36196,PS1,6,500.4,520.28,19.88,1.0,The government could introduce a coupon scheme where each household receives a coupon.
36196,PS1,6,520.28,521.48,1.2,1.0,No receives a.
36196,PS1,6,525.04,534.68,9.64,6.0,Coupons for recycling a certain amount of plastic that can then be spent on non plastic goods that.
36196,PS1,6,535.96,557.16,21.2,1.0,For recycling For recycling plastics coupons which could then be spent on who on non plastic items.
36196,PS1,6,565.95,568.35,2.4,4.0,I suddenly come up with a very insane strategy.
36196,PS1,6,568.91,577.07,8.16,4.0,"You don't need to write this down, but it's it's interesting because there are two ways to solve this problem of plastic solution."
36196,PS1,6,577.07,582.07,5.0,4.0,One is to cut down it's production and one is to find somewhere else to better bury the waste.
36196,PS1,6,582.72,584.32,1.6,2.0,So let's.
36196,PS1,6,584.44,584.8,0.36,1.0,Let it.
36196,PS1,6,584.8,586.08,1.28,4.0,Be created we can.
36196,PS1,6,586.6,587.4,0.8,2.0,Load all.
36196,PS1,6,587.4,592.52,5.12,4.0,The plastic waste on earth into the rocket and send it to Mars or to.
36196,PS1,6,595.04,597.8,2.76,1.0,"Actually, but I think there is another solution to that instead of like."
36196,PS1,6,598.28,601.12,2.84,3.0,"Yeah, because sending it by rocket each time would."
36196,PS1,6,601.2,602.6,1.4,1.0,Use a lot of fuels and stuff.
36196,PS1,6,602.6,609.88,7.28,1.0,"So I think right, right now, like some people actually just burning the plastic, they're burning that into like fuel energy."
36196,PS1,6,610.32,617.24,6.92,1.0,So it is like similar to your idea by they're actually just directly using that energy from that burn burning.
36196,PS1,6,617.24,620.6,3.36,1.0,"But yeah, do we, we have one minute guys."
36196,PS1,6,620.6,620.72,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36196,PS1,6,623.0,623.68,0.68,2.0,I think that's OK.
36196,PS1,6,623.76,623.92,0.16,2.0,That's.
36196,PS1,6,623.96,624.84,0.88,4.0,"OK, I'm just joking."
36196,PS1,6,625.48,625.52,0.04,1.0,Oh.
36196,PS1,6,626.64,628.6,1.96,3.0,That was actually like a not bad idea.
36196,PS1,6,630.68,631.36,0.68,1.0,Is that it?
36196,PS1,6,633.16,633.4,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36196,PS1,6,634.48,634.64,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
36196,PS1,6,635.28,635.84,0.56,1.0,Cool.
35681,PS4,6,17.4,21.44,4.04,1.0,I think when you guys have gun read yes I can read for you.
35681,PS4,6,21.44,34.88,13.44,1.0,Educational Educational in inequality is the is the unequal distribution of academic resources to disadvantages and marginalised groups.
35681,PS4,6,35.04,40.88,5.84,1.0,Please come up with creative idea to overcome inequality in education.
35681,PS4,6,49.48,50.4,0.92,1.0,We need to have one.
35681,PS4,6,51.16,52.84,1.68,2.0,We throw lots of ideas on the flip chart.
35681,PS4,6,52.84,55.84,3.0,2.0,Just shout them out and put them on the flip chart or just shout them out and then.
35681,PS4,6,58.36,64.6,6.24,3.0,"I I think if anybody has an idea, they can start speaking and then somebody can build them on whatever their idea is."
35681,PS4,6,65.84,76.72,10.88,3.0,"For example, I think that with the academic resources that we currently have, we could allocate some of them."
35681,PS4,6,77.48,78.24,0.76,4.0,So most of.
35681,PS4,6,78.24,85.56,7.32,3.0,Them will go towards finding a way to educate people that have typical.
35681,PS4,6,85.72,86.32,0.6,4.0,Learning.
35681,PS4,6,86.32,92.4,6.08,3.0,Abilities and maybe a chunk of it could go to towards.
35681,PS4,6,94.56,95.48,0.92,4.0,Discovering or.
35681,PS4,6,95.48,100.52,5.04,3.0,Developing ways in which we could educate people with different.
35681,PS4,6,100.52,100.88,0.36,4.0,Learning.
35681,PS4,6,100.88,116.48,15.6,3.0,Abilities and maybe you could make a study of the whole student population and figure out what percentage of the budget should go towards these people and what percentage should go towards these people and how can they can accomplish that.
35681,PS4,6,118.68,119.24,0.56,1.0,Yes.
35681,PS4,6,119.6,120.96,1.36,3.0,That's something that I could think of.
35681,PS4,6,126.92,127.68,0.76,1.0,It's only I'm looking.
35681,PS4,6,127.68,129.4,1.72,5.0,At marginalized groups I'm looking at.
35681,PS4,6,130.0,130.52,0.52,1.0,People.
35681,PS4,6,130.6,131.0,0.4,6.0,Who?
35681,PS4,6,131.6,141.84,10.24,5.0,Don't have money to access education or we're looking at people with a certain learning like learning disorder.
35681,PS4,6,143.2,144.28,1.08,5.0,So if if.
35681,PS4,6,144.48,144.72,0.24,6.0,If.
35681,PS4,6,144.72,154.64,9.92,5.0,We should look at marginalized groups then let's we are looking at people who cannot access education because they do not have money and people who have the money probably because.
35681,PS4,6,154.68,154.84,0.16,1.0,Of.
35681,PS4,6,155.92,157.16,1.24,5.0,One or two dishonest.
35681,PS4,6,157.36,160.88,3.52,5.0,They are not able to learn in the environment that we are all able to.
35681,PS4,6,160.88,161.24,0.36,1.0,Learn in.
35681,PS4,6,161.72,163.12,1.4,2.0,So yes.
35681,PS4,6,164.04,164.36,0.32,3.0,Exactly.
35681,PS4,6,164.68,165.0,0.32,2.0,I didn't.
35681,PS4,6,165.28,165.56,0.28,3.0,Think of.
35681,PS4,6,165.64,165.92,0.28,5.0,It like.
35681,PS4,6,165.92,166.48,0.56,3.0,Samuela.
35681,PS4,6,167.08,168.28,1.2,5.0,"Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere."
35681,PS4,6,168.36,168.6,0.24,5.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
35681,PS4,6,168.6,169.16,0.56,5.0,That's a good point.
35681,PS4,6,170.68,182.76,12.08,1.0,So I think it's just tackling because we are dealing with all those marginalized and then all those that have any other disadvantages that could prohibit them from accessing education.
35681,PS4,6,183.04,199.92,16.88,1.0,"So I think one of the major things that he mentioned coming up with, first of all, conducting research to identify these particular people because we have them within us and also in the different parts of the yeah, the community."
35681,PS4,6,199.92,210.64,10.72,1.0,"So if we are able to identify such people that have that do not have these resources and then those that have these problems, then we are able to sit down and come up with policies."
35681,PS4,6,210.8,219.4,8.6,1.0,We can actually sit down with government officials and inform them on how to better build and allocate resources to such people.
35681,PS4,6,219.8,220.8,1.0,1.0,I think that would work.
35681,PS4,6,222.28,224.16,1.88,4.0,"Yes, I 100% agree."
35681,PS4,6,225.16,230.24,5.08,3.0,"I think that we can maybe jot it down, start jotting it down if everybody agrees with."
35681,PS4,6,230.88,233.28,2.4,2.0,I'm interested in what do you have people have to say maybe?
35681,PS4,6,233.6,234.24,0.64,2.0,What are your thoughts?
35681,PS4,6,235.04,236.68,1.64,6.0,I think I agree with them.
35681,PS4,6,236.72,253.56,16.84,6.0,"So I think it's something like supply and demand problem, the demand and the people who like education resource and there are there exist some organizations, some people who want to who willing to provide their education resource to these kind of people."
35681,PS4,6,253.56,268.0,14.44,6.0,"So we need to come up with some creative matching strategy, how to match the people who willing to give help and how to match the people who lack of the education results."
35681,PS4,6,269.04,274.12,5.08,2.0,"I think we know who's who do we think the marginalized and disadvantaged groups are because the research tells us, doesn't it?"
35681,PS4,6,274.12,277.56,3.44,2.0,"We know what the research, There's lots, there's lots we're saying do research."
35681,PS4,6,278.04,280.72,2.68,2.0,"And then based on the research, who are the marginalized?"
35681,PS4,6,280.72,280.76,0.04,2.0,I.
35681,PS4,6,280.8,283.92,3.12,1.0,Think who we identify to two categories.
35681,PS4,6,283.92,294.16,10.24,1.0,There is one that lack the resources IE they do not have the income to access this education and then there are those that have disabilities like he mentioned.
35681,PS4,6,294.36,297.4,3.04,1.0,So in our context that's how we are viewing them.
35681,PS4,6,297.88,301.52,3.64,1.0,So if we want to get data on such people then we have to.
35681,PS4,6,301.68,315.16,13.48,1.0,"I probably conduct research because I don't know if we are just dealing with the UK, but where I come from, there are so many people that are disadvantaged in that they do not have the resources to go to school."
35681,PS4,6,315.76,320.4,4.64,1.0,But the government does not even know the percentage because they don't do extensive research.
35681,PS4,6,320.68,332.16,11.48,1.0,"So when it comes to planning on resources, it becomes very unlikely when they are planning budget or when they are planning budget for such people, it becomes very unlikely for them to cater for that those groups."
35681,PS4,6,332.2,332.44,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35681,PS4,6,332.48,344.24,11.76,1.0,"So I think doing a lot of extensive research in in those communities, those rural communities such that we are able to pick out the exact number that is affected and then we plan accordingly."
35681,PS4,6,344.8,349.4,4.6,2.0,There's lots of stuff isn't there around that kids are going to school.
35681,PS4,6,349.72,353.16,3.44,2.0,And I'm sure it's probably the same elsewhere in the UK that they're going to school.
35681,PS4,6,353.16,355.76,2.6,2.0,"If you don't get at the early stage, they never catch up."
35681,PS4,6,355.96,356.24,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35681,PS4,6,356.36,358.08,1.72,2.0,So they start a year behind.
35681,PS4,6,358.08,362.44,4.36,2.0,"So even by the age of 4, they're a year behind other kids basically."
35681,PS4,6,362.88,366.4,3.52,2.0,"So that that, So trying to catch that up and the gap tends to get wider."
35681,PS4,6,366.88,374.8,7.92,2.0,"So in terms of where you allocated, maybe at the early years might be the most beneficial in terms of where to allocate?"
35681,PS4,6,375.92,377.08,1.16,1.0,"It's probably we, we, we."
35681,PS4,6,377.12,377.4,0.28,4.0,Have to.
35681,PS4,6,378.36,379.0,0.64,1.0,Start to write.
35681,PS4,6,380.16,380.68,0.52,6.0,5 minutes.
35681,PS4,6,387.64,388.44,0.8,1.0,Probably like.
35681,PS4,6,388.68,388.92,0.24,4.0,Who?
35681,PS4,6,388.96,389.28,0.32,4.0,Who's?
35681,PS4,6,389.28,390.92,1.64,1.0,Better at English writing.
35681,PS4,6,391.24,392.04,0.8,3.0,"Like, yeah."
35681,PS4,6,392.88,393.8,0.92,1.0,"OK, good."
35681,PS4,6,394.84,395.16,0.32,3.0,"Good, but."
35681,PS4,6,395.64,395.88,0.24,1.0,So no.
35681,PS4,6,396.84,398.0,1.16,3.0,I'm not going to disconnect it.
35681,PS4,6,398.2,398.4,0.2,3.0,I'll do.
35681,PS4,6,398.6,400.96,2.36,1.0,This what's the the solution exactly?
35681,PS4,6,401.4,409.92,8.52,1.0,"We are going to do that research to identify the school, but I think the best way to identify them is from when they are young."
35681,PS4,6,411.08,412.36,1.28,1.0,So how do we do that?
35681,PS4,6,413.2,415.92,2.72,1.0,Are we going to partner with health centres?
35681,PS4,6,417.16,418.68,1.52,2.0,"So it's accessing the people, isn't it?"
35681,PS4,6,418.84,420.04,1.2,2.0,How best to access them?
35681,PS4,6,420.56,423.36,2.8,2.0,"So you can only think of so many, so many in the study really, can't you?"
35681,PS4,6,423.36,438.32,14.96,2.0,"I mean, so I suppose it's choosing A cohort, isn't it something about choosing A cohort up to a certain age And I think your point around and maybe breaking it down around maybe educational leads or disability and maybe income and."
35681,PS4,6,443.0,444.24,1.24,4.0,Related to the.
35681,PS4,6,456.72,457.0,0.28,4.0,Do we?
35681,PS4,6,457.0,474.52,17.52,6.0,Need to motivate someone to do this kind of research to do to find the identify the group so maybe a competition or we can set up a competition and set some bonus for the competition and we can people we will.
35681,PS4,6,475.36,475.92,0.56,4.0,Do a.
35681,PS4,6,476.44,478.12,1.68,6.0,And then we find the correct.
35681,PS4,6,478.84,480.48,1.64,4.0,"I'm writing American English by the way, sorry."
35681,PS4,6,483.48,484.08,0.6,2.0,Study.
35681,PS4,6,485.36,491.32,5.96,4.0,So we will do a population study from where do we go from there?
35681,PS4,6,491.32,491.52,0.2,4.0,There's.
35681,PS4,6,495.36,501.2,5.84,2.0,"Something they're doing it in a cohort to look for a certain age maybe, You know, I think there's something."
35681,PS4,6,501.6,503.12,1.52,1.0,We can take the younger age.
35681,PS4,6,504.6,529.08,24.48,4.0,From different age groups should we do because we don't want to leave the other ones out from from different study age brackets brackets and come up with new subcategories to make more sense of the problem?
35681,PS4,6,532.96,536.4,3.44,4.0,Right sense of the problem probably.
35681,PS4,6,538.6,541.84,3.24,1.0,You can just write some bullet points because we we have then.
35681,PS4,6,542.2,557.32,15.12,4.0,We can use the results to contact the authorities and ask for a change in policy.
35681,PS4,6,558.24,561.0,2.76,2.0,"But then the phone, then for a change policy."
35681,PS4,6,562.48,567.88,5.4,1.0,And probably we can like invite some famous teachers and excellent teachers in.
35681,PS4,6,568.56,569.32,0.76,5.0,Like developed.
35681,PS4,6,569.32,580.4,11.08,1.0,Countries to those areas that that are full of disadvantages and marginalized groups of people.
35681,PS4,6,581.24,583.28,2.04,2.0,What would make people participate in the study?
35681,PS4,6,584.32,588.28,3.96,2.0,"The white family have got a history of not participation, of not gaining an education."
35681,PS4,6,588.6,595.04,6.44,2.0,"And you came to me and said I want you to, I want to study your family avoiding and participate on that participate."
35681,PS4,6,595.04,599.72,4.68,2.0,So you've got to make the participation in the study exciting.
35681,PS4,6,603.8,605.16,1.36,1.0,What is OK?
35681,PS4,6,605.16,607.16,2.0,1.0,What's the major aim of this study?
35681,PS4,6,607.2,621.48,14.28,1.0,"Are we doing the study to get the total number of people that is affected by that, by the inequality in education?"
35681,PS4,6,621.8,622.36,0.56,4.0,And more.
35681,PS4,6,622.44,622.84,0.4,2.0,Blockers.
35681,PS4,6,622.84,623.6,0.76,2.0,What's stopping them?
35681,PS4,6,624.36,624.56,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35681,PS4,6,624.56,625.56,1.0,2.0,What's wrong with them?
35681,PS4,6,625.56,625.96,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35681,PS4,6,627.24,634.56,7.32,1.0,"I think, OK, to find out and then also to know that social number that's affected such that we can better plan for them."
35681,PS4,6,636.4,636.56,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
35681,PS4,6,636.6,643.52,6.92,1.0,"However, in planning, there are so many things that come that affect planning, government planning."
35681,PS4,6,647.08,649.04,1.96,4.0,We want to know what the number of students and.
35681,PS4,6,649.04,654.56,5.52,6.0,Countries all have the government use this kind of record.
35681,PS4,6,654.6,655.64,1.04,6.0,"It it has been used, it's not sure."
35681,PS4,6,655.64,659.6,3.96,2.0,"Start Sure Start in this country, the legal government in 1997, Sure Start."
35681,PS4,6,660.08,664.48,4.4,2.0,The studies around that in terms of early years intervention had a long term impact so.
35681,PS4,6,664.8,666.36,1.56,1.0,How is the education system in.
35681,PS4,6,668.6,669.88,1.28,2.0,"The UK, sorry, you know, people."
35681,PS4,6,669.92,672.76,2.84,2.0,"People are certain groups of base class, Yeah."
35681,PS4,6,674.36,676.44,2.08,2.0,"Gender, women rather than men."
35681,PS4,6,676.44,677.72,1.28,2.0,Men achieve probably more women.
35681,PS4,6,678.12,680.96,2.84,2.0,"So those things, race, class, income."
35681,PS4,6,683.8,686.36,2.56,2.0,I'm guessing you're you're saying yeah.
35681,PS4,6,688.44,690.68,2.24,5.0,"I have disagreed, yeah."
35681,PS4,6,691.52,695.72,4.2,1.0,So but education is made free for everyone or.
35681,PS4,6,696.8,699.24,2.44,2.0,"Yeah, just because it's rate doesn't mean people participate."
35681,PS4,6,702.0,702.92,0.92,2.0,It's very nice building.
35681,PS4,6,703.28,707.04,3.76,1.0,"Again, for us it's not great."
35681,PS4,6,707.44,707.88,0.44,1.0,So very many.
35681,PS4,6,708.24,708.8,0.56,4.0,People love to open.
35681,PS4,6,708.8,708.92,0.12,4.0,Guys.
35681,PS4,6,708.92,709.52,0.6,4.0,I need help.
35681,PS4,6,711.0,712.04,1.04,4.0,We have 10 seconds.
35681,PS4,6,712.04,718.2,6.16,4.0,"I guess I don't need any help, OK?"
35185,PS6,3,1.44,8.12,6.68,1.0,New Imagine A new research study discovers that singing in the shower for 20 minutes or more is good for health.
35185,PS6,3,8.92,12.64,3.72,1.0,He's not with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
35185,PS6,3,18.0,28.76,10.76,1.0,I'll come up with like toys or like fun things to do in the shower to keep people like a karaoke machine for the shower.
35185,PS6,3,32.36,39.16,6.8,2.0,Do we need to think about the fact that the logistics of it like how is it easy to make kind of waterproof or is that like not part of this?
35185,PS6,3,39.16,39.4,0.24,2.0,I don't.
35185,PS6,3,39.52,41.64,2.12,1.0,"Think that's part of the thing, you just have to come up."
35185,PS6,3,41.76,42.4,0.64,3.0,With a little something.
35185,PS6,3,42.8,56.2,13.4,2.0,"Then then to add to that, I think I think that's not a bad idea, but to promote more people to it, I think that needs to be a game element to it where there must be certain ways that you can check a person's score and this thing such that people can compete across the globe."
35185,PS6,3,57.12,58.48,1.36,2.0,Then more people can encourage to do it.
35185,PS6,3,68.04,69.64,1.6,2.0,"With scoring system, yeah."
35185,PS6,3,70.24,82.16,11.92,1.0,"With scoring global good models or local, maybe that's more relevant."
35185,PS6,3,85.16,85.52,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35185,PS6,3,96.16,103.32,7.16,1.0,"Yeah, I mean like you could game of why people like do quests maybe to like improve your singing."
35185,PS6,3,104.76,107.0,2.24,2.0,"And like, is this part of the characteristics?"
35185,PS6,3,107.0,108.0,1.0,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35185,PS6,3,108.0,111.0,3.0,1.0,So you could like have them do like levels.
35185,PS6,3,111.0,111.6,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, must."

35185,PS6,3,345.96,350.76,4.8,2.0,Then how specific we have to be for like do we have to explain the scoring system?
35185,PS6,3,352.76,353.48,0.72,1.0,I don't know.
35185,PS6,3,353.48,356.56,3.08,1.0,"I they didn't say, she just said like you have to just write."

35185,PS6,3,367.96,388.2,20.24,1.0,We have a scoring system and a local global beat up board.
35185,PS6,3,388.2,402.12,13.92,1.0,It would also have levels to train your voice.
35185,PS6,3,402.48,412.84,10.36,2.0,"For that, I guess, for example, if they hit a different teach, yeah, it's a new level, like, yeah, as many of your range of voice as possible."

35185,PS6,3,499.2,500.88,1.68,2.0,The bonus only comes after 30 days.
35185,PS6,3,501.2,502.16,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."

34673,PS2,3,381.76,388.16,6.4,3.0,Please come up with one creator 2 tackles supply chain security security.
34673,PS2,3,388.72,389.28,0.56,1.0,Vulnerable.

34673,PS2,3,430.36,441.8,11.44,3.0,"Though sometimes if they are storing in a storage house that breaks down or something happens in that storage, then the parcels cannot come in that storage and then distribution cannot happen."
34673,PS2,3,441.88,442.8,0.92,3.0,So all of that also.
34673,PS2,3,442.8,443.52,0.72,1.0,Comes in.

34673,PS2,3,481.36,481.48,0.12,2.0,But.
34673,PS2,3,482.84,485.44,2.6,3.0,We are not dependent on single step.
34673,PS2,3,485.84,486.2,0.36,2.0,Exactly.
34673,PS2,3,487.48,487.8,0.32,1.0,But how?

34673,PS2,3,527.48,537.12,9.64,2.0,"Controlled costs, yeah, or or even have like different air fried provider."
34673,PS2,3,538.8,540.28,1.48,2.0,But then there's the weather issue.
34673,PS2,3,543.48,544.2,0.72,2.0,"Well, I don't know."

34673,PS2,3,580.28,584.48,4.2,2.0,Or create a buffer stock in each of the steps.
34673,PS2,3,585.64,589.32,3.68,2.0,So if something got disrupted then like you can use.
34673,PS2,3,589.4,591.88,2.48,3.0,It could be multiple channels buffer.
34673,PS2,3,592.48,594.12,1.64,2.0,Or buffer stocks at every steps.
34673,PS2,3,594.12,602.84,8.72,2.0,"It's going to create a lot of waste, but like, yeah, this is not a problem."

34673,PS2,3,605.4,607.36,1.96,1.0,It's it's a controlled 1 and it's not.
34673,PS2,3,607.68,608.44,0.76,2.0,Inefficiently.

36386,PS4,3,89.4,89.88,0.48,3.0,Free.
36386,PS4,3,90.4,97.28,6.88,1.0,"It can be free education, but you can make compulsory for second, basic and secondary."
36386,PS4,3,97.56,104.84,7.28,1.0,"But for college it can be free for anybody that wants to, because someone might want to say I don't want to go to university, I want to go into."
36386,PS4,3,104.84,105.08,0.24,2.0,Training.
36386,PS4,3,105.08,105.24,0.16,1.0,Just.
36386,PS4,3,106.0,107.08,1.08,2.0,Eliminate that.
36386,PS4,3,107.68,108.32,0.64,1.0,Compulsory aspect.
36386,PS4,3,108.32,108.96,0.64,1.0,"No, no, no, no."
36386,PS4,3,108.96,127.4,18.44,1.0,The compulsory is important even from the basic because those children don't have the right or the power to say I want to go to school and some people might take advantage because they are marginalized and disadvantaged and not allow them like these children Hawking during school hours.
36386,PS4,3,127.68,129.44,1.76,1.0,It's not like they don't want to go to school.
36386,PS4,3,129.96,131.16,1.2,1.0,They do want to go here.
36386,PS4,3,131.44,149.32,17.88,1.0,"So you make it compulsory at that level, but at the university level that's to be someone who wants to provision of compulsory and free education for secondary and primary and secondary."
36386,PS4,3,150.16,150.4,0.24,2.0,Then.
36386,PS4,3,150.76,154.0,3.24,1.0,Optional free education to university level.
36386,PS4,3,158.0,165.28,7.28,3.0,Composure of basic education and they might not be calling it primary and secondary I.
36386,PS4,3,166.84,167.44,0.6,1.0,Think the.

36386,PS4,3,178.56,179.88,1.32,2.0,So that's it to be specific.
36386,PS4,3,186.3,197.84,11.54,2.0,"Basic in high school, then tuition free."
36386,PS4,3,201.16,204.56,3.4,1.0,Optional tuition free university.

36386,PS4,3,222.04,229.52,7.48,2.0,"Provisional, compulsory and tuition free basic and high school tuition free college then that solves this."
36386,PS4,3,230.28,231.08,0.8,2.0,Canadian as a.
36386,PS4,3,232.2,235.8,3.6,3.0,Provisional composer and tuition free basic and high school education.

36490,PS3,6,14.84,17.56,2.72,2.0,"OK, I think we should just use the a replacement for the word."
36490,PS3,6,17.56,17.8,0.24,2.0,Sorry.
36490,PS3,6,18.36,20.52,2.16,3.0,"Yeah, replacement for the word, sorry I."
36490,PS3,6,20.88,21.76,0.88,4.0,Can find another.
36490,PS3,6,21.8,22.2,0.4,5.0,Word no.
36490,PS3,6,22.28,25.6,3.32,5.0,Please come up with some critical idea to reduce his threat.
36490,PS3,6,26.12,26.48,0.36,4.0,So.
36490,PS3,6,27.12,27.8,0.68,2.0,Things to do.
36490,PS3,6,28.8,30.68,1.88,2.0,So we try to avoid forcing somebody to say sorry.
36490,PS3,6,30.84,31.48,0.64,2.0,We just don't.
36490,PS3,6,32.16,33.76,1.6,6.0,Speak English because sorry is an English right?
36490,PS3,6,35.92,36.16,0.24,4.0,How's that?
36490,PS3,6,36.16,36.84,0.68,4.0,It's a problem for me.
36490,PS3,6,36.84,37.16,0.32,4.0,English is.
36490,PS3,6,37.16,39.12,1.96,1.0,Their first language that.
36490,PS3,6,39.12,40.36,1.24,3.0,One has English as a primary.
36490,PS3,6,40.36,40.64,0.28,1.0,Language.
36490,PS3,6,42.24,49.48,7.24,3.0,So just in the pandemic we get to deal with.
36490,PS3,6,51.4,52.12,0.72,1.0,"It, I mean, it's interesting."
36490,PS3,6,52.12,60.24,8.12,1.0,"I mean, when they say pandemic as opposed, it generally required means that it's something that spreads across like the entire globe."
36490,PS3,6,60.56,69.48,8.92,1.0,"And so I mean, are they meaning just the the literal word sorry or do they just mean any kind of word in any language that it that functions as sorry as an apology?"
36490,PS3,6,71.28,72.56,1.28,1.0,"OK, that's true."
36490,PS3,6,73.0,81.56,8.56,1.0,"OK, What are what is creative way of incentivizing or deincentivizing people to not say the word sorry?"
36490,PS3,6,81.56,88.72,7.16,1.0,"I mean, you, you can, you get, you can always be kind of harsh or you can, you can, it can be through like a punishment or it could be through a reward."
36490,PS3,6,88.92,90.72,1.8,1.0,"I mean, like one idea that pops into my head."
36490,PS3,6,90.72,98.44,7.72,1.0,"People have wristbands and every time they it has a little microphone and it picks up the word sorry, it, it gives them a little shock."
36490,PS3,6,98.56,102.32,3.76,1.0,"Now that's kind of an extreme example, but I'm just thinking out loud."
36490,PS3,6,102.32,104.36,2.04,1.0,"I mean, then you run into issues with privacy."
36490,PS3,6,104.36,107.08,2.72,1.0,People want to wear something that has a microphone.
36490,PS3,6,107.36,111.64,4.28,1.0,"I don't know, but that's just an idea I mean."
36490,PS3,6,111.64,113.52,1.88,6.0,Reward and punishment idea.
36490,PS3,6,113.52,123.6,10.08,6.0,This seem interesting but the problem with the shock is that is they already said it.
36490,PS3,6,123.6,127.76,4.16,6.0,But if you want to prevent people from saying it in the first place.
36490,PS3,6,128.92,139.32,10.4,3.0,"If you do that, you find out that over time people don't want to get the punishment and it get it gradually gets to stop and then probably the phase of the pandemic stops and you know."
36490,PS3,6,141.08,144.4,3.32,4.0,"So my own suggestion is going to be a little bit different, yeah."
36490,PS3,6,144.6,151.52,6.92,4.0,"Because first of all, for there to be a word sorry, they have to be an incident that will lead to the sorry."
36490,PS3,6,152.12,153.96,1.84,4.0,So sorry is a statement.
36490,PS3,6,154.32,162.12,7.8,4.0,"So I believe if we want to avoid the use of the word sorry, which is difficult, I think we can divide the use of sign languages."
36490,PS3,6,164.4,164.56,0.16,6.0,That's.
36490,PS3,6,165.32,166.68,1.36,1.0,"And then my question, that's great."
36490,PS3,6,166.68,171.76,5.08,1.0,"I like that, that we could be find a replacement for sorry, like a sign language, it becomes universal."
36490,PS3,6,172.0,180.16,8.16,1.0,"My my question to you then is how do we create this like a system, a policy program that will get people to make that switch?"
36490,PS3,6,180.64,181.76,1.12,1.0,It'll incentivize it.
36490,PS3,6,182.04,187.2,5.16,4.0,"Simple, just like during pandemic, before pandemic we do shake, right?"
36490,PS3,6,187.76,189.28,1.52,4.0,But during pandemic you're not.
36490,PS3,6,190.4,198.88,8.48,4.0,So now you are saying sorry but but when there is a pandemic of sorry for you to stop that you can device another means Why?
36490,PS3,6,199.68,201.0,1.32,4.0,And it's a sign language.
36490,PS3,6,201.0,206.92,5.92,4.0,"You need to be communicated over the media, demonstrated, and people will be told why it's supposed to be so."
36490,PS3,6,207.48,207.96,0.48,1.0,I can't and.
36490,PS3,6,208.52,212.32,3.8,5.0,"Then your punishment is once you say sorry, so now you have the pandemic so."
36490,PS3,6,212.36,212.56,0.2,4.0,You have.
36490,PS3,6,212.8,213.84,1.04,5.0,"Yes, yes."
36490,PS3,6,214.48,216.36,1.88,4.0,You will get the the sorry virus.
36490,PS3,6,218.12,220.44,2.32,3.0,"I just say sorry, I get to spreading disease."
36490,PS3,6,220.64,221.44,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, you understand?"
36490,PS3,6,221.8,225.48,3.68,3.0,So what about the criminal minded people that want to pronounce this?
36490,PS3,6,225.88,229.2,3.32,5.0,"You can understand and Diamond, there's no cure."
36490,PS3,6,231.2,232.76,1.56,5.0,I think that's extreme.
36490,PS3,6,233.2,233.68,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
36490,PS3,6,234.08,235.96,1.88,5.0,"If we keep debating, our time will finish."
36490,PS3,6,237.76,239.2,1.44,1.0,"I mean, it is an interesting point."
36490,PS3,6,239.2,248.68,9.48,1.0,"I mean, there's always going to be some psychopathic people in society that don't respond to typical kind of through normal incentives, social norms."
36490,PS3,6,249.04,252.64,3.6,1.0,"And that's always hard people, difficult people to manage."
36490,PS3,6,252.64,256.76,4.12,1.0,"You know, perhaps no, it's a good point."
36490,PS3,6,256.76,258.36,1.6,1.0,Perhaps maybe.
36490,PS3,6,258.48,262.12,3.64,1.0,"Yeah, I'll start writing something and you guys can keep."
36490,PS3,6,262.48,263.44,0.96,1.0,I'll just say I have there's.
36490,PS3,6,263.56,270.16,6.6,4.0,A statement you made earlier by using another word for so sorry and can you think about any other word?
36490,PS3,6,272.44,272.8,0.36,3.0,It can be a.
36490,PS3,6,272.8,274.52,1.72,3.0,It can be a middle of what resource to.
36490,PS3,6,275.44,275.88,0.44,4.0,Consider.
36490,PS3,6,277.76,289.72,11.96,6.0,Oh if the golf it is not for the sound to be heard so you don't get it then everyone could wear noise cancelling headphones would cancel out the particular phrase.
36490,PS3,6,289.72,290.36,0.64,6.0,Sorry.
36490,PS3,6,290.36,291.92,1.56,1.0,That's very creative.
36490,PS3,6,292.24,296.76,4.52,4.0,"Developing a a sound, you know, like a sound cancellation app."
36490,PS3,6,298.6,298.84,0.24,3.0,Something.
36490,PS3,6,299.4,300.72,1.32,5.0,"That needs it, Yes, whenever."
36490,PS3,6,300.72,301.28,0.56,4.0,Is whenever you say.
36490,PS3,6,301.28,301.44,0.16,6.0,Sorry.
36490,PS3,6,301.44,302.6,1.16,4.0,Could not be transmitted yes.
36490,PS3,6,303.4,312.56,9.16,4.0,"So first of all, it's the use of sign language developing and it's one creative, but it just one creates and it must be creative."
36490,PS3,6,312.56,312.72,0.16,4.0,It's.
36490,PS3,6,313.64,313.96,0.32,2.0,Just right.
36490,PS3,6,313.96,314.4,0.44,2.0,There's no sign.
36490,PS3,6,314.96,318.12,3.16,1.0,"Yeah, I think that's a really creative idea though."
36490,PS3,6,318.12,329.6,11.48,1.0,"If people have headphones and when they're in public, which is maybe more likely to encounter it then, and then it just has some filter in it that it'll just screen out the word sorry, so you don't hear it."
36490,PS3,6,329.8,334.88,5.08,1.0,It's interesting because that you have to receive it in order to spread the the just spoken.
36490,PS3,6,334.88,336.24,1.36,1.0,"I guess it's like a germ, right?"
36490,PS3,6,336.24,339.2,2.96,1.0,"You have to, there'll be a host and there'll be a receiver."
36490,PS3,6,339.2,342.0,2.8,1.0,So I think your idea is actually really creative.
36490,PS3,6,342.0,342.96,0.96,1.0,But what do we want to go with?
36490,PS3,6,342.96,344.88,1.92,1.0,Because we have 6 minutes and that's enough time.
36490,PS3,6,345.12,345.4,0.28,1.0,Sorry.
36490,PS3,6,346.08,348.04,1.96,5.0,I don't understand how that particularly works.
36490,PS3,6,348.04,348.36,0.32,5.0,Is it?
36490,PS3,6,349.32,350.32,1.0,5.0,Is it the next person say the?
36490,PS3,6,350.48,350.68,0.2,2.0,Word.
36490,PS3,6,350.68,352.08,1.4,2.0,"Sorry, but you're not hearing."
36490,PS3,6,352.08,353.0,0.92,3.0,Any sorry but.
36490,PS3,6,353.72,355.44,1.72,2.0,When you say it is already in the air.
36490,PS3,6,355.84,356.72,0.88,3.0,And then there is something.
36490,PS3,6,356.96,358.84,1.88,4.0,That's what that's what I'm saying as a receptor.
36490,PS3,6,359.04,360.76,1.72,3.0,That stops it.
36490,PS3,6,361.4,362.08,0.68,1.0,From biting.
36490,PS3,6,362.84,365.24,2.4,5.0,So everybody wears it on in their ear.
36490,PS3,6,367.0,369.36,2.36,4.0,"So when you say the word sorry, it will not be transmitted."
36490,PS3,6,369.8,370.04,0.24,2.0,I think.
36490,PS3,6,370.28,371.4,1.12,1.0,That just cancel.
36490,PS3,6,371.44,373.04,1.6,1.0,It's like active noise cancellation.
36490,PS3,6,373.12,374.84,1.72,5.0,"Yeah, so everybody is meant to wear it."
36490,PS3,6,375.04,375.8,0.76,1.0,Exactly.
36490,PS3,6,375.8,377.72,1.92,4.0,"So that you don't get infected, remember?"
36490,PS3,6,378.2,381.88,3.68,2.0,"It's a pandemic, there's usually fast spread before we develop this machine and all."
36490,PS3,6,382.12,383.52,1.4,3.0,That it's a local we.
36490,PS3,6,383.96,384.32,0.36,4.0,Have to but.
36490,PS3,6,384.84,384.92,0.08,3.0,It.
36490,PS3,6,385.76,386.64,0.88,1.0,"Has to be yeah, creativity."
36490,PS3,6,386.64,386.76,0.12,1.0,OK.
36490,PS3,6,386.76,387.24,0.48,1.0,Or creativity?
36490,PS3,6,387.52,387.8,0.28,2.0,We'll go.
36490,PS3,6,387.8,388.96,1.16,1.0,"With that, we'll go with that."
36490,PS3,6,389.28,397.0,7.72,1.0,"I mean, there are some issues in terms of like because it's technology and not all countries and societies will have equal access to it, but I still think it's very creative."
36490,PS3,6,397.0,397.24,0.24,1.0,It's.
36490,PS3,6,397.28,408.24,10.96,5.0,"Creative, but I think sign language sets us, IT costs across all people that can't have access to this technology in their country."
36490,PS3,6,408.4,409.84,1.44,4.0,And it's easy to communicate.
36490,PS3,6,411.04,412.24,1.2,3.0,Creative know what?
36490,PS3,6,412.44,414.88,2.44,4.0,"It is, but then it's not, but then creative know."
36490,PS3,6,415.04,415.76,0.72,3.0,What is easy?
36490,PS3,6,415.8,416.76,0.96,3.0,What is fast?
36490,PS3,6,417.08,418.08,1.0,4.0,"Yes, creative."
36490,PS3,6,418.08,419.8,1.72,4.0,The underlying way is creative.
36490,PS3,6,421.96,422.2,0.24,1.0,OK.
36490,PS3,6,423.4,425.2,1.8,4.0,And also we are doing a business.
36490,PS3,6,451.76,453.08,1.32,4.0,To prevent it transmission.
36490,PS3,6,453.6,454.04,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
36490,PS3,6,487.76,488.44,0.68,1.0,Is that OK?
36490,PS3,6,489.16,490.76,1.6,4.0,Omitting I think.
36490,PS3,6,491.96,493.44,1.48,1.0,Omitting which word which which?
36490,PS3,6,493.48,493.64,0.16,4.0,Word.
36490,PS3,6,496.28,503.4,7.12,1.0,Technology translation technology OMET The word the audible sound of the of the word sorry will cancel out.
36490,PS3,6,503.4,517.8,14.4,1.0,I'll say I'll say that is that using the this device will cancel out the audible sound of the word sorry such that the receiver cannot hear the word.
36490,PS3,6,518.2,523.64,5.44,1.0,"This will prevent anyone hearing the words hearing the word sorry, and thus prevent transmission it."
36490,PS3,6,526.76,527.28,0.52,6.0,Should be OK.
36490,PS3,6,528.64,529.0,0.36,4.0,Yeah.
36490,PS3,6,529.8,531.44,1.64,1.0,We still got 3 minutes so we can.
36490,PS3,6,532.56,534.68,2.12,1.0,"If there's anything you want me to add or change, let me know."
36490,PS3,6,534.8,535.56,0.76,6.0,It's troubling.
36490,PS3,6,535.56,536.88,1.32,6.0,It's for one question.
36490,PS3,6,536.88,537.88,1.0,6.0,It's not troubling.
36490,PS3,6,537.88,538.48,0.6,6.0,It's for four.
36490,PS3,6,538.48,539.4,0.92,1.0,Questions exactly.
36490,PS3,6,539.4,540.12,0.72,1.0,"No, it's not."
36490,PS3,6,540.12,540.48,0.36,1.0,"No, no."
36490,PS3,6,540.48,541.76,1.28,1.0,So we'll get another fresh valve.
36490,PS3,6,541.8,542.16,0.36,6.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36490,PS3,6,542.16,542.88,0.72,6.0,See that's.
36490,PS3,6,544.6,551.6,7.0,4.0,Are we supposed to discuss the strategy for the for whatever thing we have developed?
36490,PS3,6,553.96,554.16,0.2,2.0,Like the?
36490,PS3,6,554.2,554.52,0.32,6.0,Strategy.
36490,PS3,6,554.6,555.2,0.6,4.0,To developing.
36490,PS3,6,555.2,555.68,0.48,2.0,The idea?
36490,PS3,6,556.12,556.6,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
36490,PS3,6,557.56,557.88,0.32,1.0,OK.
36490,PS3,6,558.88,559.8,0.92,1.0,"So Yep, next."
36490,PS3,6,560.6,561.16,0.56,1.0,"OK, cool."
35512,PS5,3,0.64,0.88,0.24,1.0,Hey.
35512,PS5,3,30.82,31.06,0.24,2.0,Address.
35512,PS5,3,31.1,33.34,2.24,2.0,That's the definition of what country?
35512,PS5,3,33.74,35.14,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,35.94,37.14,1.2,1.0,But I think I've just given it.
35512,PS5,3,37.14,39.12,1.98,1.0,I think it's try to look at that.
35512,PS5,3,39.4,41.84,2.44,1.0,Are we allowed to look up what voluntary attrition is?
35512,PS5,3,41.88,42.36,0.48,1.0,I feel like we.
35512,PS5,3,42.36,42.44,0.08,2.0,Are.
35512,PS5,3,42.44,43.96,1.52,2.0,"Oh duh, you mean the?"
35512,PS5,3,44.04,44.36,0.32,1.0,Difference.
35512,PS5,3,44.36,44.72,0.36,1.0,Oh right.
35512,PS5,3,44.72,45.4,0.68,1.0,"Oh yeah, it's right there."
35512,PS5,3,45.4,46.32,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,47.8,48.2,0.4,1.0,OK.
35512,PS5,3,48.4,53.52,5.12,1.0,So I reckon we just haven't got any initial ideas.
35512,PS5,3,53.56,55.2,1.64,1.0,I'll just write them all down and we can go.
35512,PS5,3,55.52,57.4,1.88,1.0,We can go and sort of narrow it down so.
35512,PS5,3,61.92,70.32,8.4,2.0,Repressing means like when someone leave the company for example the some ball set like a bad.
35512,PS5,3,70.4,81.56,11.16,1.0,"Seat Yeah yeah, yeah, just like yeah leaving because they wanted to leave so I guess for."
35512,PS5,3,83.84,98.0,14.16,2.0,Example the the director is talking about his case basically in in the most of Japanese company used to the secure the lifetime improvement.
35512,PS5,3,98.0,101.64,3.64,2.0,This is one of the Part 2 of the way of working with Japanese people.
35512,PS5,3,102.04,109.2,7.16,2.0,"But unfortunately, under this globalized society, we cannot no longer sustain this kind of a system."
35512,PS5,3,109.92,129.72,19.8,2.0,"Then many of Japanese companies try to let's say, come up with the idea, for example, the alumni, a higher system or something, which means like basically the most obvious after this situation, it's frequently happened 10 or 15 years ago in."
35512,PS5,3,129.72,130.08,0.36,1.0,Japan.
35512,PS5,3,130.52,134.24,3.72,2.0,"But yeah, company realized that this is not a healthy situation."
35512,PS5,3,134.88,145.12,10.24,2.0,"So they said, yeah, we are kind of welcome to the alumni hiring, which means like when someone leave to the company, they're working other company, then they can come back."
35512,PS5,3,145.36,145.8,0.44,1.0,OK.
35512,PS5,3,146.08,146.8,0.72,2.0,To to you know?
35512,PS5,3,147.48,148.0,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,148.56,152.4,3.84,1.0,Just does that count as like them not leave?
35512,PS5,3,152.4,153.36,0.96,1.0,Does that count as?
35512,PS5,3,154.04,156.2,2.16,1.0,Because if they leave in the 1st place they can come back.
35512,PS5,3,156.2,157.16,0.96,1.0,Does that still count as?
35512,PS5,3,157.2,157.56,0.36,2.0,Exactly.
35512,PS5,3,157.92,163.36,5.44,2.0,I think the one who did know why this has happened because some of let's say like a boss or like executive.
35512,PS5,3,163.6,163.88,0.28,1.0,People.
35512,PS5,3,164.76,166.32,1.56,2.0,Never thought they'd come back to the.
35512,PS5,3,166.68,167.44,0.76,1.0,"Company, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,167.64,170.04,2.4,2.0,"So that's why they can say some bad things, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,170.12,170.44,0.32,1.0,Really.
35512,PS5,3,171.0,174.24,3.24,2.0,Do things to the the people who read the company.
35512,PS5,3,174.36,174.68,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35512,PS5,3,175.04,187.52,12.48,2.0,"So, yeah, in my opinion, if that there is a possibility to come back that can add employee to the company, yeah, maybe this we can let's say reduce yeah possibility to this, this kind."
35512,PS5,3,187.92,194.84,6.92,1.0,"Of I guess the one thing though is if there's a possibility to come back, then people may be less reluctant to leave in the first place or."
35512,PS5,3,195.32,198.36,3.04,3.0,Wouldn't it make it make them more likely?
35512,PS5,3,198.4,199.36,0.96,1.0,"To leave, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,199.72,200.8,1.08,3.0,Find other options.
35512,PS5,3,200.84,204.0,3.16,1.0,"In a company, yeah, just like it's, it's easier for them to go on."
35512,PS5,3,204.0,204.88,0.88,1.0,Might as well leave them.
35512,PS5,3,206.44,211.4,4.96,1.0,I guess in the way you're talking about like bosses saying like bad things.
35512,PS5,3,211.4,225.96,14.56,1.0,"You could, you could like in meetings have like, I don't know, a human resources person there to basically make sure that your boss can't be everything that your boss says is heard by someone else."
35512,PS5,3,226.48,230.24,3.76,1.0,"So, you know, they can't get away with just having like."
35512,PS5,3,231.16,236.88,5.72,1.0,Should I write something something like that HR representative?
35512,PS5,3,246.32,259.68,13.36,1.0,What about like?
35512,PS5,3,269.53,276.28,6.75,3.0,"If they need a certain milestone, for example 10 years, they get like a bonus or."
35512,PS5,3,276.6,278.72,2.12,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,279.72,296.24,16.52,1.0,Bonus schemes for longevity EG receive bonus after 10 minutes at the company.
35512,PS5,3,304.64,305.16,0.52,1.0,Cool.
35512,PS5,3,309.44,315.52,6.08,1.0,What else can we put so?
35512,PS5,3,316.64,326.32,9.68,3.0,"Maybe pay for their subscriptions and so like they have to, if they want to continue like certain subscriptions, they'll have to stay in the company."
35512,PS5,3,326.6,328.52,1.92,1.0,"OK, so for."
35512,PS5,3,328.64,331.76,3.12,3.0,Example insurance or like Netflix.
35512,PS5,3,332.44,352.76,20.32,1.0,Subscriptions yeah could pay for their in insurance subscriptions to various services this means that even.
35512,PS5,3,367.04,377.72,10.68,1.0,"Cool, let's try to think of one more, I reckon."
35512,PS5,3,401.44,413.68,12.24,1.0,"I guess like stricter policies on workload, like you don't want them to get too stressed and they find it too overwhelming."
35512,PS5,3,413.68,418.36,4.68,1.0,So maybe you set like a cap or not the number of hours per week or like.
35512,PS5,3,418.92,419.88,0.96,3.0,"Work from home, work from."
35512,PS5,3,421.28,423.16,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, elsewhere, yeah."
35512,PS5,3,424.88,431.88,7.0,1.0,So have flexible working structure.
35512,PS5,3,463.42,463.74,0.32,1.0,Cool.
35512,PS5,3,464.94,469.14,4.2,1.0,"Unless you guys have got anything else, should we start narrowing these down?"
35512,PS5,3,471.3,476.14,4.84,1.0,"Yeah, so I think that one I put isn't that creative."
35512,PS5,3,476.42,484.86,8.44,1.0,So any of these that you guys think so I can make it?
35512,PS5,3,485.1,485.5,0.4,1.0,"Oh, sorry."
35512,PS5,3,485.5,489.62,4.12,1.0,Let me just put some space between them.
35512,PS5,3,500.9,502.98,2.08,2.0,"First, one thing's a little bit, claritated A."
35512,PS5,3,504.42,504.9,0.48,1.0,Little bit what?
35512,PS5,3,504.9,505.14,0.24,1.0,Sorry.
35512,PS5,3,505.54,506.22,0.68,2.0,Claritated.
35512,PS5,3,506.42,506.74,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35512,PS5,3,507.9,512.86,4.96,2.0,So bonus and Frisco walking sludge is much more.
35512,PS5,3,513.34,514.54,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
35512,PS5,3,514.9,516.74,1.84,1.0,So go into this one cool.
35512,PS5,3,517.46,521.02,3.56,1.0,"And now we've got, we've got 3 left."
35512,PS5,3,521.82,525.56,3.74,1.0,"So we've got the bonus schemes, which kind of already exists."
35512,PS5,3,525.56,526.72,1.16,1.0,That's my only hesitation.
35512,PS5,3,526.72,532.48,5.76,1.0,That's not that Creative insurance again exists.
35512,PS5,3,533.72,535.6,1.88,1.0,"Working from home, I guess exists."
35512,PS5,3,540.4,542.64,2.24,1.0,So maybe we need to think of something more creative.
35512,PS5,3,550.24,550.48,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35512,PS5,3,580.92,597.4,16.48,3.0,"What about like dependent or spouse schemes so that like even the family has to be depend, like has to depend on the person working at the company so they can't leave that easy."
35512,PS5,3,598.4,609.84,11.44,3.0,"So for example, if you pay, you pay for a bit for the child's education or."
35512,PS5,3,611.72,615.48,3.76,1.0,"Yeah, so if."
35512,PS5,3,617.28,618.28,1.0,3.0,You want to stop them.
35512,PS5,3,618.84,635.24,16.4,1.0,"From paying for dependent of the employee by the paying for childcare, education, children."
35512,PS5,3,637.48,648.52,11.04,1.0,"I guess any chronic medical needs for PTC, we happy with that one."
35512,PS5,3,649.44,651.52,2.08,1.0,"Yeah, I feel like that's the most different."
35512,PS5,3,652.68,653.0,0.32,1.0,All good.
35512,PS5,3,653.0,654.88,1.88,1.0,Me to hit some it nice.
34677,PS3,3,31.12,37.04,5.92,3.0,Imagine a new pandemic has emerged that is transmitted by saying the word sorry.
34677,PS3,3,37.76,40.24,2.48,3.0,Please come up with one criteria to reduce its spread.
34677,PS3,3,40.76,41.84,1.08,2.0,I'll be the first one to die.
34677,PS3,3,42.0,42.52,0.52,3.0,Dictate.
34677,PS3,3,43.8,47.72,3.92,1.0,"I think, yeah, like people who say sorry will be killed."
34677,PS3,3,48.32,48.84,0.52,3.0,Would be killed.
34677,PS3,3,50.52,52.28,1.76,3.0,That's how you stop the spread.
34677,PS3,3,54.64,56.84,2.2,2.0,We can give them mass also that.
34677,PS3,3,57.52,57.8,0.28,1.0,Mask.
34677,PS3,3,58.04,62.84,4.8,2.0,Mask yeah mask masks like covet mask that mute your sounds you.
34677,PS3,3,62.88,71.04,8.16,3.0,"Can't see like any technology which will change, if they say sorry it will change to something."
34677,PS3,3,71.04,72.56,1.52,1.0,Else some kind.
34677,PS3,3,73.44,74.76,1.32,3.0,Of like we always go with.
34677,PS3,3,74.76,80.16,5.4,2.0,"If you kill people who are saying sorry, all the people you'll be left with will be super self-centered."
34677,PS3,3,80.16,82.84,2.68,2.0,Like I don't want to use the word.
34677,PS3,3,82.84,84.44,1.6,3.0,That's how North Korea contained.
34677,PS3,3,85.32,87.16,1.84,2.0,"They don't say sorry, no, not like COVID."
34677,PS3,3,87.16,87.2,0.04,2.0,Oh.
34677,PS3,3,87.28,87.72,0.44,1.0,"My God, yeah."
34677,PS3,3,94.76,96.52,1.76,3.0,That they have contained that.
34677,PS3,3,97.8,99.12,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, stay in your rooms, right?"

34677,PS3,3,104.04,104.56,0.52,2.0,I don't think so.
34677,PS3,3,104.56,106.16,1.6,2.0,"But anyway, they are recording."
34677,PS3,3,106.56,106.68,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34677,PS3,3,106.92,107.96,1.04,1.0,"Anyway, we are on."

34677,PS3,3,122.48,124.28,1.8,1.0,Like I think that idea is good.
34677,PS3,3,124.28,127.52,3.24,1.0,You have a electronic device which will change as.
34677,PS3,3,127.52,130.24,2.72,2.0,"Soon as you think about saying sorry, it will give you a shock."
34677,PS3,3,130.88,134.76,3.88,1.0,"Nice, but think it's where it is."
34677,PS3,3,134.88,135.32,0.44,1.0,Like it?
34677,PS3,3,135.44,141.68,6.24,3.0,Has to stand up to the brain rather than that if there is like device will be already.
34677,PS3,3,142.56,148.88,6.32,2.0,"But I'll tell you, once you've said it right, you need to stop it before it's said neural link."
34677,PS3,3,148.88,149.88,1.0,2.0,It has to be creative.
34677,PS3,3,149.88,157.68,7.8,2.0,They aren't asking us on how we underwear or it can actually analyze ChatGPT also right?
34677,PS3,3,157.68,161.0,3.32,2.0,Essentially what it's doing is analyzing patterns of written text.
34677,PS3,3,161.0,167.56,6.56,2.0,"Similarly for spoken text, it'll know that you're going to say sorry, and it'll give a shock there only like suppose you start making."
34677,PS3,3,169.6,172.56,2.96,3.0,"Yeah, you'll have some signal in the brain that will trigger you not."
34677,PS3,3,172.76,183.2,10.44,2.0,"When you, unless you're starting a sentence, is sorry, you can still assess right whether next word is going to be sorry or not."
34677,PS3,3,185.24,194.8,9.56,2.0,"Same thing as that, even if it thinks that there's a 90% chance you sing sorry, it will give you a shock."
34677,PS3,3,200.88,201.96,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, put it."
34677,PS3,3,205.76,208.92,3.16,3.0,It's not sorry being heard rather than sorry being sent.
34677,PS3,3,210.08,211.92,1.84,3.0,What I told is sorry being.
34677,PS3,3,212.32,212.76,0.44,2.0,Heard.
34677,PS3,3,214.44,216.68,2.24,3.0,"Like my example was sorry being heard, yeah."
34677,PS3,3,217.08,217.2,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34677,PS3,3,217.4,219.28,1.88,3.0,"Yeah, its example is sorry being said that."
34677,PS3,3,219.28,224.04,4.76,2.0,"Makes sense, as soon as you say sorry they make you like."
34677,PS3,3,224.8,228.12,3.32,3.0,Irrespective of like whether someone's hearing it or not.
34677,PS3,3,229.44,230.44,1.0,2.0,"OK, why is that?"
34677,PS3,3,230.88,233.0,2.12,3.0,"Yeah, you shouldn't be saying sorry to yourself."
34677,PS3,3,233.28,244.92,11.64,2.0,"Shocks sorry as soon as you are about, but why do?"
36422,PS2,6,3.4,5.16,1.76,1.0,"Oh, supply chain security."
36422,PS2,6,12.8,15.16,2.36,1.0,What is name with vulnerabilities like this one?
36422,PS2,6,18.76,24.2,5.44,2.0,Has to do with PCs supply chain.
36422,PS2,6,27.6,31.2,3.6,2.0,"First of all, what is vulnerability within the supply chain?"
36422,PS2,6,32.32,33.24,0.92,3.0,Supply chain.
36422,PS2,6,33.32,34.2,0.88,2.0,What does it imply?
36422,PS2,6,35.08,44.8,9.72,4.0,"So what they, the way I'm interpreting this is that it basically needs like along from the manufacture of A to B."
36422,PS2,6,45.56,47.2,1.64,4.0,But what you could do is weigh everything.
36422,PS2,6,47.52,54.68,7.16,4.0,"So at every single stage you have A, you have a weighing and you should know the weight of a unit."
36422,PS2,6,54.96,59.16,4.2,4.0,"And then by weighing a bulk, you can then say, OK, well, how many?"
36422,PS2,6,59.16,73.2,14.04,4.0,"So OK, I, I don't know, maybe you are picking, let's say, let's say you're picking oranges or something and you have all of the other main fruits, difficult because they're slightly varied."
36422,PS2,6,73.4,75.4,2.0,4.0,"But maybe you're making a phone, right?"
36422,PS2,6,75.48,86.56,11.08,4.0,And you've got all the constituent parts and you know that you need to have X amount of like batteries and Y amount of like this type of metal or something like that to make a phone.
36422,PS2,6,86.84,90.36,3.52,4.0,And so at every stage there's a weigh in of what you've got.
36422,PS2,6,90.48,93.76,3.28,4.0,And you can define the total weight because you know the weight of 1 unit.
36422,PS2,6,94.2,98.92,4.72,4.0,"So if by weighing a mass number of units, you then know how many units you have there."
36422,PS2,6,98.92,103.0,4.08,4.0,And you can check at each stage that you've got the right number of units.
36422,PS2,6,103.56,108.24,4.68,4.0,And you could do this with like have like weigh something and then put it in a delivery junk.
36422,PS2,6,108.48,114.6,6.12,4.0,"And then and then you know that you've got enough, you've got the right number in the delivery junk."
36422,PS2,6,115.76,117.52,1.76,1.0,"That is, that is pretty long."
36422,PS2,6,118.28,118.36,0.08,1.0,How?
36422,PS2,6,119.28,122.4,3.12,5.0,"About that, how about we we what labour?"
36422,PS2,6,122.48,126.56,4.08,5.0,Labour and apply to the number for each of the items.
36422,PS2,6,127.6,132.08,4.48,6.0,What what they are looking at here is how to ensure that goods gets from the.
36422,PS2,6,132.6,133.16,0.56,2.0,Producer.
36422,PS2,6,133.4,134.4,1.0,6.0,To the final consumer.
36422,PS2,6,134.92,140.36,5.44,2.0,"Here, yes, and that there will not be too much loss of cost and there will be efficient delivery."
36422,PS2,6,141.24,145.92,4.68,2.0,So how do we ensure that there's efficient delivery from the producer to the consumer come up?
36422,PS2,6,146.28,148.4,2.12,3.0,With good policies now.
36422,PS2,6,148.64,149.2,0.56,2.0,"OK, so."
36422,PS2,6,150.0,159.8,9.8,3.0,Come up with good gems supply chain supply chain for.
36422,PS2,6,160.4,174.4,14.0,2.0,"The and also you should also talk about when you talk about police, you also talk talk about the means by which the team will reach the from the producer is also supply chain."
36422,PS2,6,174.96,186.8,11.84,2.0,How will this thing get to the final person so that in the long run we talk about efficiency so that the product may not export or it will not be damaged?
36422,PS2,6,187.56,190.52,2.96,3.0,You can use construct so that you'll be right because our time is.
36422,PS2,6,191.48,194.4,2.92,5.0,Separate separate the delivery process for different.
36422,PS2,6,197.32,205.6,8.28,5.0,So separate the delivery process and ABC and then tracking in each block.
36422,PS2,6,207.84,208.84,1.0,2.0,"OK, stop."
36422,PS2,6,208.88,210.8,1.92,4.0,"That yeah, I think the solution."
36422,PS2,6,210.8,211.2,0.4,1.0,Has to be.
36422,PS2,6,211.24,212.0,0.76,1.0,"Well, what is the idea?"
36422,PS2,6,212.4,215.32,2.92,4.0,Separate to humans or workers because.
36422,PS2,6,216.12,216.6,0.48,5.0,Separate.
36422,PS2,6,217.44,226.6,9.16,4.0,If you're if you're trying to come up with a system that's foolproof and it's never gonna fail and you're always gonna have everything exactly as it is.
36422,PS2,6,227.0,227.48,0.48,5.0,So what?
36422,PS2,6,227.48,228.44,0.96,5.0,What is anybody?
36422,PS2,6,229.8,230.4,0.6,6.0,That's anything.
36422,PS2,6,230.44,230.84,0.4,3.0,To just.
36422,PS2,6,230.92,231.4,0.48,2.0,Construct.
36422,PS2,6,231.4,234.32,2.92,2.0,Construct so that he can actually like something.
36422,PS2,6,234.6,234.76,0.16,4.0,That.
36422,PS2,6,234.84,244.52,9.68,5.0,"Means separate today the the the supply chain into into distinct bodies, Yeah."
36422,PS2,6,246.16,247.12,0.96,3.0,Distinct No.
36422,PS2,6,247.48,247.64,0.16,5.0,1
36422,PS2,6,248.48,248.84,0.36,1.0,Into.
36422,PS2,6,250.12,251.4,1.28,2.0,Distinct components.
36422,PS2,6,252.48,253.68,1.2,3.0,The supply chain into.
36422,PS2,6,253.68,255.64,1.96,2.0,Distinct components.
36422,PS2,6,255.92,265.56,9.64,3.0,In brackets in manufacturers the the middle and K and above.
36422,PS2,6,267.92,268.32,0.4,4.0,Pick up.
36422,PS2,6,269.72,269.84,0.12,5.0,Pick.
36422,PS2,6,271.12,272.04,0.92,2.0,Up wholesalers.
36422,PS2,6,272.48,273.36,0.88,2.0,Is it the wholesalers?
36422,PS2,6,273.52,274.08,0.56,2.0,Returners.
36422,PS2,6,274.2,275.84,1.64,2.0,The tellers are the final people.

36422,PS2,6,277.92,278.04,0.12,3.0,And.
36422,PS2,6,279.12,279.88,0.76,5.0,The and the returners.
36422,PS2,6,280.28,280.4,0.12,4.0,Pick.
36422,PS2,6,281.16,281.24,0.08,1.0,Up.
36422,PS2,6,281.44,282.4,0.96,5.0,Pick pick up someone.
36422,PS2,6,284.32,291.0,6.68,2.0,"To pick up, yeah, that's that's that efficient, efficient believer pick up that use of Anthony, no other."
36422,PS2,6,294.32,294.72,0.4,6.0,Bracket.
36422,PS2,6,295.32,295.92,0.6,2.0,Bracket.
36422,PS2,6,296.36,299.28,2.92,3.0,"Inside the bracket, the final consumer."
36422,PS2,6,304.08,307.44,3.36,5.0,Pick up on the delivery until into the delivery process.
36422,PS2,6,316.29,316.85,0.56,3.0,The delivery.
36422,PS2,6,316.97,319.41,2.44,5.0,I think after the delivery pick up then.
36422,PS2,6,319.93,322.65,2.72,2.0,Pick up is not supposed to be between.
36422,PS2,6,322.81,327.49,4.68,2.0,"This is pick up, not the last one."
36422,PS2,6,329.84,330.16,0.32,1.0,"Oh, there."
36422,PS2,6,330.28,331.24,0.96,2.0,Are two pickups yeah put.
36422,PS2,6,333.52,333.72,0.2,3.0,Screen.
36422,PS2,6,335.28,336.08,0.8,4.0,But what is turned?
36422,PS2,6,336.08,337.12,1.04,3.0,Into this thing company.
36422,PS2,6,337.64,337.72,0.08,2.0,Uh huh.
36422,PS2,6,337.92,343.8,5.88,2.0,"There should be a means of carrying this thing, so we should also put the means of delivering this."
36422,PS2,6,345.4,353.04,7.64,4.0,"Well, do it different to wherever the consumer is because if you were delivering something to a consumer who was in your saying cat on, you could almost walk in there."
36422,PS2,6,353.48,354.92,1.44,4.0,So if you walk in so I think.
36422,PS2,6,354.96,357.84,2.88,5.0,I think the first stage is a pickup farm manufactured.
36422,PS2,6,358.92,363.48,4.56,4.0,"But it's not just about the delivery, it's the whole supply chain and it's vulnerabilities in the whole supply chain."
36422,PS2,6,363.48,367.64,4.16,4.0,And so that means essentially loss at every stage in manufacturing.
36422,PS2,6,368.16,373.68,5.52,5.0,"So the OK, yeah, shall we, shall we just tell him exactly what we're going to tell him?"
36422,PS2,6,373.96,376.88,2.92,5.0,So pick up from the manufacturer is the first stage.
36422,PS2,6,376.88,378.4,1.52,5.0,I mean pick up.
36422,PS2,6,379.08,379.16,0.08,4.0,Oh.
36422,PS2,6,379.84,380.64,0.8,5.0,Pick up from that's.
36422,PS2,6,380.76,383.92,3.16,4.0,Not the package the problem because that.
36422,PS2,6,384.24,391.56,7.32,5.0,"Package firstly, package from the on the manufacturing package, yeah."
36422,PS2,6,392.12,393.72,1.6,4.0,But the supply chain already exists.
36422,PS2,6,393.72,395.0,1.28,4.0,We're not changing the supply chain.
36422,PS2,6,395.0,395.84,0.84,4.0,We're making it better.
36422,PS2,6,396.96,398.2,1.24,3.0,This from manufacturer.
36422,PS2,6,398.44,399.4,0.96,3.0,Let's think of because.
36422,PS2,6,401.0,401.4,0.4,5.0,Oh yeah.
36422,PS2,6,401.52,404.04,2.52,5.0,"But anyway, we don't need to deter detail everything."
36422,PS2,6,404.04,415.96,11.92,5.0,"So yeah, we just say the main thing to be separated is my chain into a distinct components and then then tracking each component."
36422,PS2,6,416.64,419.8,3.16,5.0,"Yeah, tracking each component."
36422,PS2,6,423.44,424.56,1.12,2.0,To make sure it gets.
36422,PS2,6,426.84,427.44,0.6,5.0,Make sure it.
36422,PS2,6,428.4,428.6,0.2,2.0,Gets.
36422,PS2,6,441.72,441.92,0.2,2.0,This.
36422,PS2,6,442.32,442.48,0.16,4.0,Yeah.
36422,PS2,6,442.72,443.08,0.36,2.0,This is.
36422,PS2,6,446.08,448.52,2.44,4.0,What you need is a system of checking that there isn't any.
36422,PS2,6,448.52,448.96,0.44,2.0,Less tracking.
36422,PS2,6,451.0,452.56,1.56,4.0,"Yeah, while tracking or."
36422,PS2,6,452.6,461.76,9.16,5.0,"Or sure, I mean, I mean any component, any component that can report if they find any faulty or any problems and then they can track it back."
36422,PS2,6,461.76,463.4,1.64,5.0,They promise that they.
36422,PS2,6,464.64,464.96,0.32,2.0,Process.
36422,PS2,6,466.16,466.92,0.76,4.0,But how are you going to?
36422,PS2,6,467.36,469.88,2.52,4.0,How are you going to detect the faults or a lack of something?
36422,PS2,6,472.16,473.56,1.4,4.0,"Yeah, we just, we just write."
36422,PS2,6,474.04,474.6,0.56,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, OK."
36422,PS2,6,474.76,480.64,5.88,5.0,I know we we just typing something just make sure we get something wrong and we are not going to argue for enemies.
36422,PS2,6,481.04,486.16,5.12,5.0,"So if they are, I mean if there are any."
36422,PS2,6,486.44,490.6,4.16,2.0,Problems any damage fault or fault?
36422,PS2,6,490.88,495.84,4.96,2.0,"Yeah, there should be any system or they reporting back."
36422,PS2,6,496.28,496.8,0.52,5.0,"Yeah, they report."
36422,PS2,6,514.2,517.96,3.76,5.0,And clearly tracking well which components caused the problem.
36422,PS2,6,546.8,547.68,0.88,4.0,"Yeah, I don't know."
36422,PS2,6,547.92,553.6,5.68,4.0,"Because if your system relies on people reporting, that relies on them caring enough to report."
36422,PS2,6,554.44,558.64,4.2,4.0,"And again, this is the human element of Can you trust that all of your work is in a factory or?"
36422,PS2,6,558.64,559.24,0.6,5.0,"You'll go, Yeah, yeah."
36422,PS2,6,559.28,559.48,0.2,5.0,OK.
36422,PS2,6,559.6,560.68,1.08,5.0,Give us some idea.
36422,PS2,6,560.68,561.72,1.04,5.0,You think it's working?
36422,PS2,6,561.88,562.08,0.2,5.0,No.
36422,PS2,6,562.08,563.24,1.16,5.0,To that idea it doesn't work.
36422,PS2,6,563.24,563.76,0.52,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36422,PS2,6,563.76,564.52,0.76,5.0,What shall we say?
36422,PS2,6,564.52,565.04,0.52,4.0,Waiting.
36422,PS2,6,565.12,573.92,8.8,4.0,"If you weigh, if you had, if you had a number of products and you know what the weight is going to be before you weigh them afterwards, if there's a mismatch, you know you've lost some product."
36422,PS2,6,574.36,579.28,4.92,4.0,And so then you can immediately mathematically tell that we've got a loss.
36422,PS2,6,579.6,581.84,2.24,4.0,"And then you can go, OK, stop the system."
36422,PS2,6,581.84,582.4,0.56,4.0,Where's the loss?
36422,PS2,6,582.44,583.8,1.36,4.0,Where has never become loss.
36422,PS2,6,584.52,586.56,2.04,4.0,"And then you know that there's this, this has happened."
36422,PS2,6,586.56,590.56,4.0,4.0,And that's an automated way of of having a definitive loss.
36422,PS2,6,591.08,602.2,11.12,4.0,"If you if you weigh a set of products or components before and after each stage in your process, you know that if this weight matches up, you will."

34663,PS6,6,1122.04,1125.32,3.28,6.0,And even the what is it the shower head can come up with with these lights?
34663,PS6,6,1137.48,1142.8,5.32,2.0,"Speakers, I'm not my neighbors listening to what I'm saying."
34663,PS6,6,1143.96,1145.24,1.28,3.0,Is is the spelling correct?
34663,PS6,6,1145.24,1146.08,0.84,3.0,What is spelled R?

34663,PS6,6,1183.92,1186.08,2.16,6.0,Or we can actually make this like a regulated thing.
34663,PS6,6,1186.08,1189.88,3.8,6.0,So every shower head that's being sold in the market has that.
34663,PS6,6,1190.2,1191.52,1.32,6.0,"It has to has that, yeah."
34663,PS6,6,1192.24,1216.4,24.16,6.0,So that people you know or just make it subsidized so it doesn't subsidized.
34663,PS6,6,1218.36,1219.72,1.36,4.0,Introduce subsidized.
35042,PS6,3,4.0,5.52,1.52,1.0,I like this one this.
35042,PS6,3,5.56,5.76,0.2,2.0,Is fun.
35042,PS6,3,5.96,6.2,0.24,2.0,How?
35042,PS6,3,6.44,6.68,0.24,2.0,How?
35042,PS6,3,6.72,7.04,0.32,2.0,How?
35042,PS6,3,7.92,16.0,8.08,1.0,Speakers Speakers for the shower but and it's set with a timer but.
35042,PS6,3,16.28,17.88,1.6,2.0,Singing the shower for 20 minutes.
35042,PS6,3,17.88,19.12,1.24,2.0,"It's a long shower, right?"
35042,PS6,3,19.48,21.0,1.52,1.0,"Yeah, but you make it into a game."
35042,PS6,3,21.0,28.24,7.24,1.0,"You make it into a game where you have these speakers on the shower and there's a timer, and you try to get to 20 minutes."
35042,PS6,3,28.24,34.96,6.72,1.0,"Like some days you won't be able to, but you try, and then it's like a scoreboard and you're competing against your friends."
35042,PS6,3,34.96,35.36,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35042,PS6,3,35.56,35.72,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35042,PS6,3,35.76,37.28,1.52,1.0,See who can sing the longest who.
35042,PS6,3,37.72,38.24,0.52,2.0,Can sing more.
35042,PS6,3,38.24,40.64,2.4,1.0,And who can sing more like in tune with the song?
35042,PS6,3,40.96,45.68,4.72,1.0,So it's like kind of like a game where you need to try to sing the song like the best.
35042,PS6,3,45.96,47.44,1.48,2.0,"And you can just do it with your phone, right?"
35042,PS6,3,47.92,50.4,2.48,1.0,"Yeah, and then you can see like your friends, ha ha."
35042,PS6,3,50.44,52.0,1.56,1.0,They were like super off tune.
35042,PS6,3,53.16,54.88,1.72,2.0,I'm concerned with the environmental.
35042,PS6,3,54.88,55.84,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, of course, me too."
35042,PS6,3,55.84,57.44,1.6,1.0,"But but that is a task, you know?"
35042,PS6,3,57.48,60.4,2.92,1.0,I also don't want people to sing in the shower for 20 minutes.
35042,PS6,3,61.4,63.52,2.12,2.0,"Oh, maybe when you shower, you have a shower."
35042,PS6,3,63.72,64.64,0.92,2.0,You think it's good?
35042,PS6,3,64.72,64.84,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35042,PS6,3,65.24,66.08,0.84,3.0,I think it's very creative.
35042,PS6,3,66.32,69.32,3.0,2.0,If you if you have a shower that only operates if you're singing.
35042,PS6,3,70.12,72.56,2.44,1.0,"Yeah, but like, but what if you want to take a 4 minute shower?"
35042,PS6,3,72.68,73.72,1.04,2.0,You sing for 4 minutes.
35042,PS6,3,73.72,75.28,1.56,1.0,"No, but you need a 20 minute shower."
35042,PS6,3,75.6,76.24,0.64,3.0,That's the problem.
35042,PS6,3,77.84,79.56,1.72,2.0,You need to shower for 20 minutes or more.
35042,PS6,3,80.24,81.8,1.56,3.0,"That's what, that's what I want, yeah."
35042,PS6,3,82.08,83.2,1.12,2.0,I'm singing sing.
35042,PS6,3,83.32,85.4,2.08,1.0,Sing while you shower for 20 minutes.
35042,PS6,3,86.72,89.64,2.92,2.0,"I feel like the only way is to like, do it that way."
35042,PS6,3,89.64,92.28,2.64,2.0,Like having the water come out if you're singing.
35042,PS6,3,92.28,94.68,2.4,1.0,"Yeah, but I but by 4 minutes in I'm done."
35042,PS6,3,97.16,98.64,1.48,2.0,"Oh, and then you look at the point."
35042,PS6,3,99.68,100.04,0.36,1.0,Yes.
35042,PS6,3,100.6,102.72,2.12,2.0,Then the pointing system is for making it longer.
35042,PS6,3,102.76,109.48,6.72,1.0,"Yeah, the point system is like the target is 20 and if you hit 20, you don't."
35042,PS6,3,109.48,109.6,0.12,3.0,Have.
35042,PS6,3,109.96,112.4,2.44,1.0,"To win anything specific, but like, you win points, yeah."
35042,PS6,3,112.76,117.6,4.84,1.0,And you compete with your friends to see who has the most points.
35042,PS6,3,117.6,127.52,9.92,1.0,"And then if you want to make it even, like a stronger incentive, like if you get enough points, maybe you get a discount on something, a voucher for."
35042,PS6,3,128.12,129.8,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, a voucher for a massage or something."
35042,PS6,3,132.04,136.04,4.0,1.0,"I got you for something health related because it's like health benefits, right?"
35042,PS6,3,137.96,142.36,4.4,2.0,I feel like it was very soon if you if you like singing gets you hot water.
35042,PS6,3,142.92,144.44,1.52,2.0,"If you don't sing, you get cold water."
35042,PS6,3,145.52,146.16,0.64,2.0,Something like that.
35042,PS6,3,146.48,148.24,1.76,2.0,Like forces you to sing.
35042,PS6,3,148.8,149.4,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
35042,PS6,3,149.72,151.4,1.68,1.0,Or like if you don't hit the pitch.
35042,PS6,3,152.32,152.4,0.08,1.0,Oh.
35042,PS6,3,152.72,152.92,0.2,2.0,Right.
35042,PS6,3,153.28,154.36,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, singing in tune."
35042,PS6,3,154.96,156.96,2.0,2.0,"Just singing is the benefit, not singing in tune."
35042,PS6,3,157.88,159.72,1.84,1.0,"Yeah, but it keeps you singing because you want to hit the."
35042,PS6,3,160.64,161.72,1.08,2.0,You got to get higher points.
35042,PS6,3,161.72,162.68,0.96,1.0,What if you're really bad?
35042,PS6,3,163.8,164.52,0.72,2.0,You get no bonus.
35042,PS6,3,166.68,167.84,1.16,1.0,"OK, I think this is a good idea."
35042,PS6,3,168.96,170.4,1.44,3.0,"Yeah, I think this is a great idea."
35042,PS6,3,171.16,178.76,7.6,3.0,"This is very creative, natural for myself, something I said is beneficial to your health."
35042,PS6,3,180.24,180.52,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35042,PS6,3,181.72,183.92,2.2,1.0,I wonder if they want us to use a 12 minutes to do?
35897,PS4,3,0.16,8.8,8.64,1.0,OK education inequality is the unequal distribution of academic resources to disadvantage and marginalized groups come with one creative idea to overcome inequality in education as.
35897,PS4,3,9.44,9.76,0.32,2.0,We create.
35897,PS4,3,10.76,12.6,1.84,3.0,One creative idea to overcome inequality.
35897,PS4,3,12.72,14.24,1.52,1.0,Then education for everyone.
35897,PS4,3,16.6,17.16,0.56,2.0,That's funny.
35897,PS4,3,17.44,17.88,0.44,2.0,You're equal.
35897,PS4,3,18.64,19.12,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,19.92,22.44,2.52,1.0,"Then you're all yeah, then there's no inequality."
35897,PS4,3,28.72,40.44,11.72,3.0,"On equal distribution of academic resources to disadvantaged and marginalised groups, I mean the the I guess you could say the most pragmatic idea would be to like."
35897,PS4,3,41.12,42.0,0.88,1.0,Affirmative action.
35897,PS4,3,42.0,47.28,5.28,3.0,Split the student body into like like different parts of society.
35897,PS4,3,48.52,52.0,3.48,3.0,But the issue with that would then be like practically.
35897,PS4,3,52.16,53.96,1.8,1.0,Is this something like affirmative action or no?
35897,PS4,3,55.36,56.36,1.0,3.0,What's affirmative action?
35897,PS4,3,57.2,61.16,3.96,1.0,Like where you would give like quotas to certain like say groups?
35897,PS4,3,62.16,63.92,1.76,2.0,So like schools will admit certain.
35897,PS4,3,64.04,64.52,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,64.52,66.0,1.48,2.0,People certain races or something?
35897,PS4,3,66.84,72.52,5.68,3.0,"Yeah, more like so, yeah, set backgrounds and like like 20% there's 20% this rules and sort of equally submit."
35897,PS4,3,73.16,73.88,0.72,3.0,"OK, so that's."
35897,PS4,3,74.24,76.64,2.4,2.0,And that's fixed over time.
35897,PS4,3,77.72,78.52,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,79.12,85.2,6.08,3.0,"OK, then again this says like the only core distribution I can resource is specifically resources."
35897,PS4,3,85.2,85.92,0.72,3.0,So how do we?
35897,PS4,3,88.56,90.96,2.4,3.0,"Yeah, resources are in groups, I think."
35897,PS4,3,91.36,92.56,1.2,3.0,"Oh OK, So how do?"
35897,PS4,3,92.8,101.56,8.76,1.0,You come up with like or basically increase academic resources to the extent that it's over abundant such that find more.
35897,PS4,3,101.56,101.92,0.36,3.0,Money.
35897,PS4,3,102.44,115.04,12.6,1.0,"Yeah, basically like you like increase drastically your investment in education so that you have like a huge amount of like resources that then wouldn't, no, no one would be actually worried that they're not getting a good share."
35897,PS4,3,115.8,116.28,0.48,2.0,I see.
35897,PS4,3,117.24,119.92,2.68,2.0,"OK, so maybe we can find ways to get more money like?"
35897,PS4,3,123.48,127.2,3.72,1.0,So over abundance of resources can result in equal.
35897,PS4,3,127.6,130.32,2.72,1.0,"Not that it's no, but it's could still be unequal though."
35897,PS4,3,133.0,135.6,2.6,2.0,But with the ISIS idea about the quota and.
35897,PS4,3,136.72,142.88,6.16,1.0,"Allocating, yeah, quota for allocation."
35897,PS4,3,143.08,154.96,11.88,1.0,"But then if you have quotas for allocation, technically you would have a similar situation in India where, for example, because of the caste system, they had like affirmative action such that they reserve certain amounts of like seedings for each caste."
35897,PS4,3,155.16,158.92,3.76,1.0,But then that results in intracaste inequalities.
35897,PS4,3,160.16,163.12,2.96,3.0,What do you I was thinking more China's model 'cause I think that works quite well.
35897,PS4,3,163.12,164.56,1.44,3.0,"I mean, you get certain people."
35897,PS4,3,164.56,164.96,0.4,2.0,Who?
35897,PS4,3,165.6,170.8,5.2,3.0,Don't like the system but then it it's more equal I guess.
35897,PS4,3,171.0,177.96,6.96,1.0,But OK so so basically you have a quote UN quote dictatorship where instead of banning education you just force everyone to have the same education.
35897,PS4,3,179.2,180.16,0.96,3.0,"Kind of, yeah, Yeah."
35897,PS4,3,182.32,193.44,11.12,1.0,"But then in practical terms, like I'd say, because it doesn't specify like what I mean, it's not necessarily saying that you have to have equality and quality."
35897,PS4,3,193.72,195.64,1.92,1.0,So technically you can just ban education.
35897,PS4,3,196.28,200.04,3.76,1.0,I I I've root for that as an evil dictator.
35897,PS4,3,203.04,206.4,3.36,3.0,It's like the only Co distribution of academic resources to this one.
35897,PS4,3,207.28,214.36,7.08,3.0,"The the way I interpret this is maybe poorer cities, poorer areas don't get the resources that more."
35897,PS4,3,215.28,215.56,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,215.56,217.36,1.8,1.0,"Like, yeah, yeah, of course."
35897,PS4,3,217.36,219.08,1.72,3.0,In which case that's a wider problem.
35897,PS4,3,219.08,219.6,0.52,3.0,That's not.
35897,PS4,3,219.64,221.76,2.12,3.0,You can't really fix that with just education.
35897,PS4,3,223.72,224.6,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35897,PS4,3,224.6,229.28,4.68,1.0,But if you want to overcome inequality in education without caring about anything else.
35897,PS4,3,229.52,235.04,5.52,3.0,"Home schooling, home schooling, just hold that everyone would be like I have access to the Internet and then you can just."
35897,PS4,3,236.6,239.36,2.76,1.0,But then people might have different level of access to the Internet.
35897,PS4,3,239.6,240.24,0.64,2.0,"Oh yeah, that's true."
35897,PS4,3,241.48,245.96,4.48,3.0,"That would be the problem we solved, and you make sure that everyone's got access to the Internet and then everyone could just."
35897,PS4,3,245.96,246.2,0.24,1.0,Work.
35897,PS4,3,246.28,250.92,4.64,1.0,"But then like for motivational wise where like people have like, you know, characteristic differences."
35897,PS4,3,251.48,252.4,0.92,2.0,That's not an activity.
35897,PS4,3,253.68,254.04,0.36,1.0,"Resource, right?"
35897,PS4,3,255.72,259.2,3.48,3.0,"No, what she's saying is people have different needs based on like maybe learning difficulties."
35897,PS4,3,260.2,277.96,17.76,1.0,"Yeah, I'll be saying so, so, so, so yeah, like technically the idea would be that you have some sort of a dictatorial model that that like that basically forces everyone to pursue the same type and I guess of education."
35897,PS4,3,278.4,290.36,11.96,1.0,"But again, I think the simplistic way of approaching this is to just purely ban education, because that way there would be there wouldn't be like anything to be equal about."
35897,PS4,3,292.68,293.0,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,293.04,297.2,4.16,3.0,"But also, I mean that that's that's very impractical."
35897,PS4,3,297.2,298.64,1.44,3.0,"But you know, the government's only do that."
35897,PS4,3,299.2,301.52,2.32,1.0,"Well, we're not talking about practicality here."
35897,PS4,3,302.2,305.24,3.04,3.0,"And I mean, when you say bad education, how do you enforce that?"
35897,PS4,3,305.24,311.12,5.88,3.0,Because you'll get the wealthy people just get to is in and they'll still get their kids educated or like the way they want.
35897,PS4,3,311.12,317.08,5.96,1.0,To but the same way that if you have a dictatorship or if you have affirmative actions like similar issues still going to arise so.
35897,PS4,3,318.32,331.12,12.8,3.0,"Yeah, what I'm saying is if you say bad education, it's it you're essentially doing the same thing where the the people who are wealthy, they can afford to get tutors or send their kids abroad or do to do other things that poor people can't."
35897,PS4,3,331.12,335.28,4.16,3.0,"So essentially you're still, they're still an unequal, they still divide that."
35897,PS4,3,336.88,344.68,7.8,1.0,But that I think is a like sort of common issue across all type of policies is that there's always going to be loopholes and people can't try to get around it.
35897,PS4,3,344.84,352.04,7.2,1.0,"But theoretically speaking, it wouldn't be a challenge."
35897,PS4,3,354.56,365.92,11.36,2.0,"OK, So what if we first come up with ways to increase the funds for education and then decide how to use these funds in a more equal manner 'cause we want to 1st get."
35897,PS4,3,366.12,366.64,0.52,3.0,The resources.
35897,PS4,3,366.88,367.12,0.24,2.0,So we.
35897,PS4,3,367.12,371.32,4.2,1.0,Want to combine essentially the solution of over abundance of resource?
35897,PS4,3,371.44,375.88,4.44,1.0,"Yes, with like allocation strategies, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,376.24,376.52,0.28,3.0,OK.
35897,PS4,3,376.96,379.4,2.44,1.0,"I think that's also, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,379.64,387.2,7.56,2.0,What are some creative ways to get people to donate to education systems or like?
35897,PS4,3,388.04,394.08,6.04,1.0,"Threaten people that if you do not donate, we are going to ban education for everyone so that rich people will have to donate."
35897,PS4,3,395.88,398.28,2.4,2.0,"You know, rich people will just keep the money to themselves because I have a."
35897,PS4,3,398.28,399.6,1.32,1.0,"Way, Yeah, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,400.6,406.12,5.52,3.0,I mean like one way which isn't very feasible.
35897,PS4,3,406.12,416.44,10.32,3.0,You just need to standardise everything as in like just have a certain amount of schools open in every city and then have a pool of mini which gets allocated equally to each school.
35897,PS4,3,416.44,422.96,6.52,3.0,"Now that's the most black and white way, but I feel like logistically it doesn't really work."
35897,PS4,3,426.76,427.96,1.2,3.0,"Do you mean like, do you know what I mean?"
35897,PS4,3,429.16,434.08,4.92,3.0,"Like the sort of, but this kind of leans more towards dictation because it's, it's all in the hands of the government."
35897,PS4,3,434.08,451.12,17.04,3.0,But basically the government opens a certain amount of schools in every city and then through the standardized curriculum and then has a pool of money that ought to go towards education and then equally distributes that money and the result like to each school to support all the resources.
35897,PS4,3,455.36,463.04,7.68,2.0,"But do we need to rely on the government or do we have like, local nonprofits who take care of their communities, students?"
35897,PS4,3,464.88,480.6,15.72,3.0,"That that would also be idea, but then if it's local nonprofit, you'd suffer from the minimum distribution because if you're a local company, you're limited by like how wealthy your city is and the people you know."
35897,PS4,3,480.6,484.52,3.92,3.0,So you'll get the wealthy areas who will have far better resources than poorer cities.
35897,PS4,3,486.2,488.04,1.84,3.0,Because I would I would definitely lean towards that.
35897,PS4,3,488.04,490.68,2.64,3.0,But I think we will still have how many distribution.
35897,PS4,3,492.0,505.08,13.08,2.0,"OK, what if we asked the government to intervene at the step where OK, we start off with the local organizations from so we have local organizations and rich communities and local organizations and poor communities."
35897,PS4,3,505.8,514.84,9.04,2.0,And then we asked the government to after day of like finish building up stuff swap or something too as well.
35897,PS4,3,515.28,515.64,0.36,3.0,Like.
35897,PS4,3,516.28,518.36,2.08,1.0,"OK, I, I, I think I like that idea."
35897,PS4,3,519.28,521.0,1.72,1.0,"Like, essentially, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,521.0,531.84,10.84,1.0,"Like, essentially, like you would have to build something keeping in mind that eventually whatever you built may subjugate it to you not owning it it."
35897,PS4,3,532.68,533.12,0.44,2.0,"Would be, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,533.24,536.2,2.96,1.0,So basically you have like sort sort of like shuffling of allocation.
35897,PS4,3,536.44,536.96,0.52,2.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,537.36,538.24,0.88,1.0,"OK, right, like."
35897,PS4,3,538.24,540.44,2.2,2.0,The rich people build schools for the poor.
35897,PS4,3,540.48,540.8,0.32,1.0,People.
35897,PS4,3,541.68,545.48,3.8,1.0,"Oh, become more abundant than that could."
35897,PS4,3,545.48,545.76,0.28,3.0,Work.
35897,PS4,3,545.84,546.4,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,547.52,552.16,4.64,1.0,"Oops, optimize their progression."
35897,PS4,3,552.16,575.7,23.54,1.0,"Meant before then transferring, being transferred at random."
35897,PS4,3,577.0,587.72,10.72,1.0,Let's see provided by another group.
35897,PS4,3,589.48,601.16,11.68,1.0,"This randomization process should occur at a regular interval, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,601.6,602.36,0.76,2.0,Until we reach some.
35897,PS4,3,602.56,607.12,4.56,1.0,Equally particular interval such that I like this idea.
35897,PS4,3,607.12,608.92,1.8,1.0,"Statistically, it's very sound that."
35897,PS4,3,609.68,610.24,0.56,3.0,Does work.
35897,PS4,3,610.48,612.6,2.12,3.0,"Also, we've got minutes, so that's the thing."
35897,PS4,3,613.0,613.16,0.16,1.0,Oh yes.
35897,PS4,3,613.16,631.32,18.16,1.0,"Should that occur at regular intervals, such that after a few rounds every district subgroup should receive equal level of resources?"
35897,PS4,3,634.44,635.04,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, that sounds good."
35897,PS4,3,635.8,638.16,2.36,1.0,"Like sort of at a macro level, right?"
35897,PS4,3,638.36,641.08,2.72,1.0,"Yeah, macro level."
35897,PS4,3,645.88,647.0,1.12,1.0,I love that idea.
35897,PS4,3,647.84,649.6,1.76,1.0,"Like, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,649.6,650.28,0.68,1.0,"No, no, no."
35897,PS4,3,650.52,651.16,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, no thank."
35897,PS4,3,651.8,651.88,0.08,2.0,You.
35897,PS4,3,653.48,655.4,1.92,1.0,"Yeah, it's probably better than banning education."
35897,PS4,3,656.16,656.52,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,657.16,662.12,4.96,1.0,"So basically people take sort of equal chances in becoming advantage that's this managed, right?"
35897,PS4,3,663.56,663.68,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,665.88,667.72,1.84,3.0,"I'm like OCD, don't mind me."
35897,PS4,3,676.28,676.92,0.64,1.0,Provisions.
35897,PS4,3,677.24,678.8,1.56,3.0,And I'm also British.
35897,PS4,3,681.8,682.4,0.6,1.0,Maximise.
35897,PS4,3,683.32,683.88,0.56,3.0,"Sorry, Helen."
35897,PS4,3,684.04,684.4,0.36,3.0,Sorry Helen.
35897,PS4,3,687.92,690.08,2.16,3.0,I'm I'm I'm outnumbered by YouTube but like.
35897,PS4,3,692.48,694.08,1.6,2.0,"Optimise, maximise."
35897,PS4,3,694.52,694.72,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
35897,PS4,3,694.72,695.2,0.48,1.0,We don't use.
35897,PS4,3,695.4,696.92,1.52,3.0,"A face unit function, yeah."
35897,PS4,3,697.12,698.52,1.4,1.0,Oh God no.
35897,PS4,3,698.52,698.64,0.12,1.0,But.
35897,PS4,3,699.56,700.8,1.24,2.0,You pronounce it as AZAZ.
35897,PS4,3,702.84,703.56,0.72,1.0,Maximize.
35897,PS4,3,703.96,704.44,0.48,2.0,Maximize.
35897,PS4,3,705.28,711.24,5.96,3.0,"But we don't I, I feel like ours isn't as heavy as maximize, but it's like it's not as heavy as AZ."
35897,PS4,3,711.24,711.8,0.56,3.0,"OK, OK."
35897,PS4,3,712.8,713.0,0.2,1.0,That way.
35897,PS4,3,713.24,713.72,0.48,3.0,Randomization.
35897,PS4,3,718.28,718.4,0.12,3.0,Jeez.
35420,PS2,6,0.2,0.96,0.76,1.0,Acid typing.
35420,PS2,6,14.83,15.07,0.24,2.0,Right.
35420,PS2,6,29.67,32.83,3.16,1.0,I don't really know what it means by you vulnerabilities in a supply.
35420,PS2,6,32.91,36.79,3.88,3.0,"Chain people stealing stuff, Is it machines breaking?"
35420,PS2,6,38.23,39.63,1.4,2.0,"Yeah, it could be a few things."
35420,PS2,6,39.63,50.72,11.09,2.0,"I think more just like, let's say if you like relied on one producer for parts and then that they had like, you know, they were a bit dodgy."
35420,PS2,6,50.72,56.68,5.96,2.0,"Their technology was faulty, their infrastructure was in a place that was vulnerable to like hurricanes."
35420,PS2,6,56.8,60.28,3.48,2.0,"Obviously if they run into trouble, then you're in a lot of trouble."
35420,PS2,6,60.6,61.64,1.04,2.0,So it's kind of stuff like that.
35420,PS2,6,64.36,64.96,0.6,4.0,Brexit.
35420,PS2,6,65.68,66.16,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,67.04,74.6,7.56,4.0,"Because there's a lot of, at least within labs, a lot of lab equipment is now taking too long to get."
35420,PS2,6,75.12,75.52,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,77.28,77.8,0.52,4.0,Policy.
35420,PS2,6,78.44,80.4,1.96,2.0,I'm trying to think what other kind of vulnerability?
35420,PS2,6,86.8,90.68,3.88,5.0,Is the focus looking at vulnerabilities or how to solve the vulnerabilities?
35420,PS2,6,92.52,93.56,1.04,1.0,How to solve it?
35420,PS2,6,96.72,99.36,2.64,4.0,One creative idea to tackle supply chains.
35420,PS2,6,100.08,102.24,2.16,1.0,The most creative idea we can think of.
35420,PS2,6,104.44,106.4,1.96,3.0,If it's like the least creative question.
35420,PS2,6,106.48,106.96,0.48,6.0,Ever.
35420,PS2,6,107.72,111.28,3.56,1.0,I just thought armed guards did tackle the security.
35420,PS2,6,111.28,112.88,1.6,3.0,Duplicate supply chain.
35420,PS2,6,113.24,114.12,0.88,6.0,Just have a backup.
35420,PS2,6,114.44,116.32,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, if we used AI to look at an armed."
35420,PS2,6,123.12,124.2,1.08,3.0,Get insurance.
35420,PS2,6,124.52,130.8,6.28,2.0,"Yeah, get parts from multiple suppliers."
35420,PS2,6,131.24,133.32,2.08,6.0,"Yeah, I know it's so creative, but yeah."
35420,PS2,6,133.8,135.84,2.04,2.0,"Yeah, least creative thing."
35420,PS2,6,136.68,139.84,3.16,2.0,"Yeah, surely, surely we're going to spend a bit more time trying to."
35420,PS2,6,144.96,146.48,1.52,3.0,"Alright, that's one idea, yeah."
35420,PS2,6,146.52,155.97,9.45,2.0,You get.
35420,PS2,6,155.97,158.97,3.0,3.0,Supplies from multiple suppliers who also have insurance.
35420,PS2,6,160.57,160.85,0.28,6.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,172.96,176.88,3.92,6.0,Just like by default set your delivery schedules.
35420,PS2,6,176.88,179.6,2.72,6.0,"So let me longer you know, I would just say Q."
35420,PS2,6,180.04,181.12,1.08,4.0,So overestimate.
35420,PS2,6,181.4,183.36,1.96,6.0,"Yeah, just overestimate your delivery."
35420,PS2,6,183.36,183.88,0.52,4.0,Schedule.
35420,PS2,6,194.82,201.82,7.0,2.0,You could like over order and build up like a stock that yeah when you have.
35420,PS2,6,205.2,205.28,0.08,4.0,So.
35420,PS2,6,212.56,212.96,0.4,2.0,To like.
35420,PS2,6,214.64,215.56,0.92,1.0,Negate problems.
35420,PS2,6,216.04,218.64,2.6,3.0,"Yeah, AI to optimise your delivery schedule."
35420,PS2,6,220.28,221.4,1.12,4.0,That actually is AI.
35420,PS2,6,221.44,222.44,1.0,4.0,Think that's a creative idea?
35420,PS2,6,223.72,226.36,2.64,5.0,Then the premise of the discussion is to look at how we can use.
35420,PS2,6,226.92,228.12,1.2,2.0,"Us instead of oh again, they are."
35420,PS2,6,229.08,235.0,5.92,4.0,"Not sure about that actually it's using AI to that's your, that's your prompt."
35420,PS2,6,236.48,239.84,3.36,4.0,Your prompt is that there is vulnerabilities in the system.
35420,PS2,6,239.84,241.96,2.12,4.0,So come up with a creative idea.
35420,PS2,6,243.8,244.6,0.8,4.0,AI is a tool.
35420,PS2,6,244.92,247.44,2.52,4.0,You can use it to organise your schedule.
35420,PS2,6,253.16,256.52,3.36,5.0,I'm also thinking putting robust storage systems.
35420,PS2,6,256.52,256.96,0.44,3.0,In place.
35420,PS2,6,257.88,263.72,5.84,5.0,That has like within the line of delivery maybe we supplies to you.
35420,PS2,6,264.72,265.0,0.28,6.0,OK.
35420,PS2,6,276.87,289.19,12.32,4.0,"I guess Amazon is one of those companies that has a lot of safeguarding right along the way and that is typically what they do, right?"
35420,PS2,6,289.19,293.71,4.52,4.0,"You order, it gets dispatched."
35420,PS2,6,295.03,299.64,4.61,3.0,"Yeah, they have the resources to have dispatching places everywhere."
35420,PS2,6,299.8,300.48,0.68,4.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,301.4,304.32,2.92,5.0,So like partnering with Amazon Logistics?
35420,PS2,6,308.64,309.8,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, why not?"
35420,PS2,6,310.68,311.72,1.04,4.0,"It's reliable, right?"
35420,PS2,6,312.84,314.48,1.64,3.0,"Yeah, spell it right, Amazon."
35420,PS2,6,314.56,315.4,0.84,3.0,Give me a good price.
35420,PS2,6,315.4,319.68,4.28,4.0,Because I think Amazon also like they've got the warehouses are where they stock exactly.
35420,PS2,6,319.68,322.2,2.52,4.0,"So what someone was saying, put storage places in the line."
35420,PS2,6,322.88,323.08,0.2,2.0,Right.
35420,PS2,6,323.8,325.04,1.24,4.0,So they already stocked things.
35420,PS2,6,325.04,330.0,4.96,4.0,"So when you order it, it's just they just go to the shelf and pick it up and put it in a box, right."
35420,PS2,6,330.0,330.12,0.12,4.0,And.
35420,PS2,6,331.76,332.92,1.16,5.0,Now you have 6 ideas.
35420,PS2,6,335.6,335.76,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,338.8,340.08,1.28,5.0,Do you have to choose that?
35420,PS2,6,340.68,341.36,0.68,3.0,One creative.
35420,PS2,6,341.56,342.44,0.88,1.0,"Idea, yeah."
35420,PS2,6,345.44,345.56,0.12,2.0,OK.
35420,PS2,6,348.56,350.6,2.04,3.0,What's the most creative of these?
35420,PS2,6,356.76,358.08,1.32,4.0,Created by what parameter I?
35420,PS2,6,359.2,363.88,4.68,1.0,Think it said like novel and useful in like a little introduction.
35420,PS2,6,364.16,366.12,1.96,6.0,"Yeah, something that AI would not think."
35420,PS2,6,366.52,367.72,1.2,4.0,About because this.
35420,PS2,6,367.72,368.32,0.6,4.0,"Oh, I see."
35420,PS2,6,368.48,370.36,1.88,6.0,They're comparing our prompts to that.
35420,PS2,6,372.96,376.0,3.04,2.0,Something that AI would not think about is quite a daunting.
35420,PS2,6,376.76,377.28,0.52,5.0,Heavy.
35420,PS2,6,395.84,396.6,0.76,6.0,Should we vote?
35420,PS2,6,399.12,401.08,1.96,2.0,Sounds like a merger with your.
35420,PS2,6,401.88,403.24,1.36,4.0,"Yeah, let's try merging."
35420,PS2,6,404.36,405.64,1.28,2.0,So you can just control that.
35420,PS2,6,434.37,458.36,23.99,6.0,"Should we try to somehow like, connect those ideas We can like overestimate delivery schedules and overestimate the amount of supply we need?"
35420,PS2,6,459.24,461.48,2.24,4.0,To regulate rather than negative.
35420,PS2,6,461.88,466.08,4.2,2.0,Deficits to.
35420,PS2,6,466.08,466.76,0.68,4.0,Regulate I.
35420,PS2,6,473.36,475.76,2.4,2.0,Feel like the get AI one is quite vague.
35420,PS2,6,475.76,476.32,0.56,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35420,PS2,6,479.16,483.12,3.96,5.0,"And I feel the point, the last point could go into the last but one point."
35420,PS2,6,484.8,485.56,0.76,5.0,What do you think?
35420,PS2,6,486.72,487.28,0.56,1.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,488.4,491.04,2.64,3.0,"Yeah, partnering with another company that's libel."
35420,PS2,6,491.04,496.88,5.84,3.0,Dispatching centres stocks along the delivery route to malt like.
35420,PS2,6,500.28,503.76,3.48,2.0,Do you reckon you need to specify a bit more about like the partnering?
35420,PS2,6,505.72,506.08,0.36,4.0,Because.
35420,PS2,6,509.2,511.0,1.8,2.0,I just said have a partnership.
35420,PS2,6,512.44,513.76,1.32,2.0,"Again, doesn't really entail."
35420,PS2,6,514.24,514.68,0.44,6.0,M&A.
35420,PS2,6,515.48,515.8,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,522.8,524.16,1.36,4.0,While partnering.
35420,PS2,6,528.64,529.08,0.44,6.0,Yeah.
35420,PS2,6,529.48,530.0,0.52,3.0,There you go.
35420,PS2,6,530.16,532.84,2.68,3.0,"Well, partnering and then it's one comprehensive language."
35420,PS2,6,532.92,533.24,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, some."
35420,PS2,6,535.68,536.2,0.52,5.0,Creator.
35420,PS2,6,538.8,540.64,1.84,2.0,"I mean, surely I know some of the compromises."
35420,PS2,6,540.88,541.36,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, that's good."
35420,PS2,6,544.92,553.76,8.84,6.0,"I think that's the thing like AI or the best would like this first one and it will be gradually should you know, it's a lot of questions, yeah."
35420,PS2,6,555.08,556.84,1.76,2.0,I was going to say we're probably one more down.
35420,PS2,6,557.8,562.28,4.48,6.0,"Yeah, I guess like the the later questions are more creative in themselves."
35420,PS2,6,564.04,570.72,6.68,3.0,"Yeah, it's not just here's a really boring business problem that there's like 2 possible solutions to, neither of which you're creating."
35420,PS2,6,571.0,572.16,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, I was going to say."
36283,PS3,6,0.96,6.52,5.56,1.0,Imagine a new pandemic has emerged by Oh my God this is terrible honestly.
36283,PS3,6,6.92,7.56,0.64,2.0,"Sorry, has."
36283,PS3,6,8.16,9.48,1.32,3.0,Come up with one creative idea.
36283,PS3,6,9.68,10.52,0.84,1.0,"We're in the UK, it's."
36283,PS3,6,10.8,11.16,0.36,2.0,Not going.
36283,PS3,6,11.16,11.24,0.08,3.0,To.
36283,PS3,6,11.24,11.76,0.52,4.0,Reduce the.
36283,PS3,6,11.8,26.92,15.12,3.0,"Spread well, well non creative idea would be just to ban the word sorry and replace the word sorry if it's something else like excuse me, so people when you know would say that or, you know, invent a new word that is I don't know."
36283,PS3,6,29.32,30.96,1.64,1.0,"I'll just, I'll just write everything down because."
36283,PS3,6,32.12,33.2,1.08,3.0,That's it's not in the.
36283,PS3,6,33.2,33.92,0.72,2.0,Work Really.
36283,PS3,6,35.12,36.64,1.52,3.0,Because you you mean.
36283,PS3,6,36.64,37.64,1.0,3.0,Why you mean?
36283,PS3,6,37.68,47.2,9.52,2.0,"Because like, even if you're mandating that, who's following it and who's who's keeping a check on it, like creatively, that's a nice creative idea, but like."
36283,PS3,6,49.48,51.96,2.48,5.0,Maybe then like rather saying allow hear some.
36283,PS3,6,52.0,53.28,1.28,2.0,"Gesture, for example."
36283,PS3,6,53.6,56.68,3.08,2.0,Everybody here says sorry in every second sentence.
36283,PS3,6,56.72,57.04,0.32,2.0,It's.
36283,PS3,6,57.04,57.36,0.32,3.0,True.
36283,PS3,6,58.44,60.16,1.72,3.0,So you mean that because it's like?
36283,PS3,6,60.24,61.12,0.88,2.0,It's such a habit.
36283,PS3,6,61.36,62.44,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, it's such a habit."
36283,PS3,6,62.72,63.56,0.84,3.0,So scrutinously.
36283,PS3,6,63.56,63.96,0.4,3.0,We're going to.
36283,PS3,6,63.96,65.08,1.12,2.0,Be yeah using.
36283,PS3,6,65.08,69.68,4.6,3.0,"The word, even without, you know, deliberately wanting to spread the virus."
36283,PS3,6,70.04,70.16,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36283,PS3,6,70.44,75.04,4.6,1.0,You can learn different language and use the word or or all the word in something.
36283,PS3,6,75.68,76.6,0.92,3.0,That's good you.
36283,PS3,6,76.64,77.04,0.4,2.0,Can just.
36283,PS3,6,77.32,79.76,2.44,1.0,"Do depending on whether it works on the OK, so I say."
36283,PS3,6,79.76,81.92,2.16,2.0,Does that mean that are you looking at me?
36283,PS3,6,82.0,86.8,4.8,2.0,"But also like what if we just use like a very similar sounding but instead of sorry, we say Sonny."
36283,PS3,6,90.16,91.88,1.72,1.0,That seems like a mocking of certain accent.
36283,PS3,6,91.92,92.36,0.44,1.0,"OK, it's."
36283,PS3,6,92.36,95.72,3.36,2.0,"Close to sorry, but like you're not saying sorry, but it's like Sonny."
36283,PS3,6,97.08,100.04,2.96,3.0,Or just maybe somehow create a linguistic trick.
36283,PS3,6,100.36,106.68,6.32,3.0,"Yeah, that we instead of sorry, we say sorry."
36283,PS3,6,106.68,106.96,0.28,3.0,Sorry.
36283,PS3,6,107.4,107.84,0.44,1.0,Like twice.
36283,PS3,6,109.72,109.84,0.12,2.0,It.
36283,PS3,6,112.48,113.48,1.0,3.0,Only recognizes the.
36283,PS3,6,113.52,113.88,0.36,4.0,Single.
36283,PS3,6,113.88,114.08,0.2,3.0,"Yeah, so."
36283,PS3,6,114.28,114.8,0.52,2.0,The question.
36283,PS3,6,115.44,117.4,1.96,4.0,Is it's just all the English words?
36283,PS3,6,117.4,135.68,18.28,4.0,"Sorry, we need to replace the common other language like Spanish or China, Tuputzi or yeah, yeah, we need to work with the libraries, the vocabulary to remove all these words from the culture."
36283,PS3,6,135.88,138.32,2.44,2.0,"No, but then we're assuming something."
36283,PS3,6,138.32,144.64,6.32,2.0,"We're assuming that people in Spain, what will happen to them If, if Yeah."
36283,PS3,6,144.8,145.88,1.08,1.0,It's not clear whether it's.
36283,PS3,6,146.24,149.04,2.8,2.0,Spreading like if they're if you're using their language.
36283,PS3,6,149.24,150.24,1.0,1.0,Could we do something maybe?
36283,PS3,6,150.24,152.48,2.24,2.0,We should do not use language like.
36283,PS3,6,152.52,161.36,8.84,2.0,"We should maybe create a symbol for it or something like like some gesture, somebody's gesture or like, I don't know."
36283,PS3,6,161.96,162.84,0.88,4.0,What language is also?
36283,PS3,6,163.44,165.84,2.4,2.0,But like then what will the Spanish users do?
36283,PS3,6,166.0,168.08,2.08,2.0,Or what will like like people can we?
36283,PS3,6,168.12,170.12,2.0,1.0,Change the social language around.
36283,PS3,6,170.16,170.56,0.4,4.0,Politics.
36283,PS3,6,171.12,171.48,0.36,4.0,English.
36283,PS3,6,171.76,172.24,0.48,4.0,English Words.
36283,PS3,6,173.52,173.84,0.32,5.0,"Yeah, because."
36283,PS3,6,175.32,176.88,1.56,1.0,"It's, it's, it's, it's in quote."
36283,PS3,6,176.88,179.28,2.4,1.0,"So it's not like saying apologizing, it's just saying, yeah, sorry."
36283,PS3,6,180.32,181.32,1.0,3.0,Just the word itself.
36283,PS3,6,181.92,182.68,0.76,2.0,So yeah.
36283,PS3,6,183.12,185.8,2.68,1.0,But is there a way to change the social norms around apologizing?
36283,PS3,6,185.8,186.6,0.8,1.0,Would that also help?
36283,PS3,6,186.96,188.08,1.12,1.0,"And so, but that will take a long."
36283,PS3,6,188.08,190.6,2.52,2.0,"That's a bigger project that could take care of that, but is it?"
36283,PS3,6,190.72,191.08,0.36,1.0,A creative.
36283,PS3,6,191.88,197.52,5.64,3.0,"Creative or we could somehow, I don't know, like no, that's such a good idea."
36283,PS3,6,197.52,202.8,5.28,3.0,"It's a good idea, but that we can also create like some sort of, I don't know, I'm being creative, right?"
36283,PS3,6,202.84,203.48,0.64,3.0,Don't judge me.
36283,PS3,6,203.88,216.96,13.08,3.0,"Like a wearable that recognizes sound and wherever it recognizes, sorry, like the first letters, it kind of gives a big sound that prevents."
36283,PS3,6,218.4,218.68,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36283,PS3,6,220.12,232.68,12.56,2.0,"But I was thinking that since you said about the, the, you know, the nature of apologizing, why not use the pandemic as a motivation to actually change apologetic culture?"
36283,PS3,6,233.56,236.12,2.56,2.0,Like that's a big motivation.
36283,PS3,6,236.12,239.48,3.36,2.0,"Like it's like people, people apologize all the time for no reason at all."
36283,PS3,6,239.48,243.12,3.64,2.0,And it's like very related to so many psychological concepts.
36283,PS3,6,243.56,248.84,5.28,2.0,Pandemic could be like such a such a big motivator to even get that social shift.
36283,PS3,6,250.0,275.16,25.16,4.0,"But but we are here because we we need to reduce the spread when the sea when it's it, it should be announced so the old upon this area is infected and to to to to people around you to know it shouldn't go because if AI will identify this story some kind of announcement how it wants to be transmitted immediately."
36283,PS3,6,275.16,276.96,1.8,4.0,This area is is infected with.
36283,PS3,6,277.68,278.08,0.4,1.0,Right.
36283,PS3,6,278.08,285.6,7.52,1.0,"So doesn't mean that you get the so OK, so let's say you, you have a disease which is not like sorry related, but you you spread the disease by saying sorry."
36283,PS3,6,286.04,288.36,2.32,1.0,So the disease itself is not like saying that's not.
36283,PS3,6,288.44,290.64,2.2,4.0,"Right, first, there are two two things."
36283,PS3,6,290.64,300.16,9.52,4.0,"First we need to say, OK, we need to replace the words with somebody language for so sign, but that's not as we need to stop a spread."
36283,PS3,6,300.64,315.4,14.76,4.0,"If we can involve AI to solve this problem again, if our devices will listen us like a CD, whatever, see this and hear this story immediately it will be alarming."
36283,PS3,6,315.4,316.68,1.28,4.0,"Next, Yes."
36283,PS3,6,316.84,319.28,2.44,2.0,"Right, like."
36283,PS3,6,319.32,321.2,1.88,3.0,An emergency messenger like awareness.
36283,PS3,6,321.4,321.64,0.24,2.0,"Yeah, this."
36283,PS3,6,322.84,325.16,2.32,4.0,This area is infected and that's that's actually.
36283,PS3,6,325.88,326.92,1.04,3.0,Nothing that's a good idea.
36283,PS3,6,326.92,329.52,2.6,3.0,And don't forget that we need something that is quick.
36283,PS3,6,329.56,335.28,5.72,3.0,We're talking about a pandemic that is happening right now and we want to stop transmission.
36283,PS3,6,335.48,348.24,12.76,3.0,"So all this cultural changes take time to, you know, to put into action by the time we change our apologizing culture, the pandemic, the virus, whatever we need all around the world."
36283,PS3,6,348.56,352.8,4.24,3.0,So we want like a trick that will quickly block the spread but.
36283,PS3,6,353.56,355.48,1.92,5.0,What if the spread is not like physically?
36283,PS3,6,356.0,358.2,2.2,5.0,What if I say sorry then immediately everyone.
36283,PS3,6,358.2,358.32,0.12,1.0,Like.
36283,PS3,6,359.56,360.44,0.88,2.0,"Just yeah, just like."
36283,PS3,6,360.52,371.24,10.72,4.0,"Yeah, but neighbors say somebody in in 100 meters of us should know this area, let's say infected and they will stay and stay excited."
36283,PS3,6,371.24,371.56,0.32,4.0,It will be.
36283,PS3,6,371.64,371.84,0.2,3.0,More.
36283,PS3,6,371.88,372.84,0.96,2.0,Integrated and like but.
36283,PS3,6,372.96,375.44,2.48,5.0,"If it's not by distance, I mean like, yeah, yeah."
36283,PS3,6,375.44,377.6,2.16,5.0,Like how it transmits it from my phone to your phone.
36283,PS3,6,377.92,382.52,4.6,5.0,"Just like if I say sorry, just automatically someone in the world just get transmitted."
36283,PS3,6,383.32,385.52,2.2,2.0,"Oh, you mean like by text?"
36283,PS3,6,385.96,386.12,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
36283,PS3,6,386.4,387.16,0.76,1.0,"Oh no, that's so."
36283,PS3,6,387.32,388.28,0.96,5.0,"By physical distance, but."
36283,PS3,6,389.16,390.8,1.64,1.0,"I think it's a stay in the way, so."
36283,PS3,6,391.04,391.36,0.32,2.0,Maybe.
36283,PS3,6,392.28,394.48,2.2,6.0,"I think we should imagine, we should make an assumption that."
36283,PS3,6,394.6,399.16,4.56,3.0,"Saying the word sorry is like as if we're caffeine in front of someone, you know?"
36283,PS3,6,399.16,400.36,1.2,3.0,"Yeah, so."
36283,PS3,6,400.56,402.76,2.2,4.0,"Means we're talking about very short distance in between, like."
36283,PS3,6,404.04,404.76,0.72,1.0,When you can hear it.
36283,PS3,6,404.96,405.36,0.4,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36283,PS3,6,406.16,411.68,5.52,4.0,"If I say, for example, sorry here, everybody infected but not the people outside the room, that's the case."
36283,PS3,6,411.68,419.6,7.92,4.0,"But people outside the room should know this room is already in the red area, in a risky area, and they should stop communicate with us."
36283,PS3,6,420.2,421.52,1.32,3.0,So I I I agree.
36283,PS3,6,421.52,425.68,4.16,2.0,With it or we just go non verbal.
36283,PS3,6,426.16,427.4,1.24,5.0,"Yeah, but that's for a."
36283,PS3,6,427.64,428.12,0.48,2.0,While that's very.
36283,PS3,6,428.24,434.28,6.04,5.0,"Effective, but I wouldn't say that's too creative because that's how everyone was so popular, by giving alarms."
36283,PS3,6,434.96,435.04,0.08,2.0,You.
36283,PS3,6,435.4,435.88,0.48,2.0,Just you.
36283,PS3,6,436.12,436.64,0.52,3.0,Just literally.
36283,PS3,6,436.76,437.68,0.92,3.0,"I mean, I like."
36283,PS3,6,438.32,438.88,0.56,4.0,I like.
36283,PS3,6,439.16,459.04,19.88,3.0,"The software in my phone that recognizes the sound of sorry and by I don't know GPS recognition, it kind of tracks whoever is within a radius like a distance of X meters around me and gets an alert of you are infected you should quarantine."
36283,PS3,6,461.24,461.36,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36283,PS3,6,462.24,464.28,2.04,4.0,"By the way, a very interesting question."
36283,PS3,6,464.28,466.68,2.4,4.0,"If I'm not infected, if I'm, I'm."
36283,PS3,6,466.84,467.92,1.08,4.0,"If I'm, let's say clean."
36283,PS3,6,468.08,472.72,4.64,4.0,"If I stay in, stands alone in front of the mirror for example, and say sorry, what was what?"
36283,PS3,6,473.24,473.6,0.36,2.0,Has happened.
36283,PS3,6,475.12,476.36,1.24,5.0,"Like, would you make assumptions?"
36283,PS3,6,476.36,476.68,0.32,5.0,Oh my God.
36283,PS3,6,476.8,476.92,0.12,5.0,Well.
36283,PS3,6,478.44,478.8,0.36,2.0,That is.
36283,PS3,6,479.32,484.72,5.4,4.0,"And they we need, we need to think about antivirus every, every type of story."
36283,PS3,6,485.16,487.0,1.84,4.0,I might be blocking another type of word.
36283,PS3,6,487.08,492.6,5.52,4.0,"I I don't know, but you know, to spread, to spread a virus, we need to have two things."
36283,PS3,6,492.6,496.68,4.08,4.0,"First to isolate a risk area war, warming, alarming."
36283,PS3,6,496.68,500.08,3.4,4.0,"And 2nd to treat it somehow, to stop it somehow."
36283,PS3,6,500.24,500.72,0.48,4.0,Could you?
36283,PS3,6,500.84,505.12,4.28,1.0,Make a vaccine sorry to make the vaccine against the saying of the.
36283,PS3,6,505.2,505.36,0.16,4.0,Word.
36283,PS3,6,505.36,512.28,6.92,4.0,"Yeah, maybe we need to create another word, very, very bad word like whatever to to stop."
36283,PS3,6,512.64,521.08,8.44,4.0,I don't know but if if this kind of spreads exist because it's fantastic.
36283,PS3,6,521.08,531.08,10.0,4.0,"Yeah, it's ridiculous to to spread with this was was of sort we need to think out of box creating some another word would probably stop this."
36283,PS3,6,531.56,532.36,0.8,4.0,Sorry spread.
36283,PS3,6,532.36,532.84,0.48,4.0,I don't know.
36283,PS3,6,532.84,535.68,2.84,4.0,That's a scientist that does not not not mine of yours.
36283,PS3,6,537.16,538.68,1.52,5.0,You mean like find an alternative way of?
36283,PS3,6,539.04,545.2,6.16,4.0,"Saying yeah, no, no, no, no, not alternative to, to, to find another word or not, just like a naive."
36283,PS3,6,545.6,546.24,0.64,2.0,Or something.
36283,PS3,6,546.84,548.8,1.96,2.0,1000 Apologies.
36283,PS3,6,551.04,552.32,1.28,1.0,"OK, so we have 3 minutes."
36283,PS3,6,552.32,556.16,3.84,1.0,We have to should we vote on something or we're actually quite decided on?
36283,PS3,6,556.16,556.72,0.56,2.0,This one all.
36283,PS3,6,557.28,558.44,1.16,1.0,"Of them it says one idea, so it."
36283,PS3,6,558.44,559.64,1.2,3.0,Can we have less than 3 minutes?
36283,PS3,6,559.88,561.64,1.76,1.0,So let's so we it should be some yeah.
36283,PS3,6,561.64,563.2,1.56,1.0,Or we have to you have to decide on.
36283,PS3,6,563.2,563.84,0.64,1.0,That's one thing I.
36283,PS3,6,563.84,564.2,0.36,2.0,Appreciate.
36283,PS3,6,564.2,564.96,0.76,2.0,I really like the device.
36283,PS3,6,564.96,566.6,1.64,2.0,I really like the device.
36283,PS3,6,568.2,569.28,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, that's good."
36283,PS3,6,569.44,572.0,2.56,2.0,Contamination instead.
36283,PS3,6,572.88,582.52,9.64,3.0,"So we may, we all agreed that it's it's not going to be quick to change our habits and replace the one story with something else."
36283,PS3,6,583.0,590.32,7.32,3.0,"So since we're in emergency, we need to find out to come up with an idea that it will give much quicker protection."
36283,PS3,6,595.84,597.2,1.36,5.0,I do like IDF 5 as well.
36283,PS3,6,597.28,597.48,0.2,5.0,IDF.
36283,PS3,6,598.56,598.84,0.28,2.0,5
36283,PS3,6,599.64,600.12,0.48,5.0,It's like.
36283,PS3,6,601.08,601.8,0.72,2.0,"Yeah, that's also."
36283,PS3,6,602.04,602.32,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36283,PS3,6,602.6,602.88,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36283,PS3,6,603.48,608.0,4.52,2.0,And I think the commentary both the ideas is that we we are trying to use the AI for both.
36283,PS3,6,610.44,611.52,1.08,1.0,"OK, so let me just."
36283,PS3,6,615.64,619.2,3.56,5.0,"So I think ideas are somewhat like incorbent, like to get a notation."
36283,PS3,6,620.36,620.76,0.4,1.0,That's true.
36283,PS3,6,620.88,621.16,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, that's."
36283,PS3,6,621.64,622.88,1.24,5.0,"True, that's already kind of used."
36283,PS3,6,623.12,625.84,2.72,2.0,Or what if we combine idea five with 7 where?
36283,PS3,6,626.08,629.28,3.2,2.0,Where like if somebody says sorry there's a loud beep.
36283,PS3,6,629.8,630.68,0.88,5.0,And it notifies.
36283,PS3,6,631.0,634.36,3.36,2.0,"But even if that fails, then there is an alarm."
36283,PS3,6,634.8,637.32,2.52,3.0,There is a sorry voice tracker.
36283,PS3,6,637.48,638.36,0.88,3.0,"Yeah, that."
36283,PS3,6,638.56,639.08,0.52,2.0,Follows.
36283,PS3,6,640.4,648.0,7.6,3.0,That first of all alerts anyone who is around that person that they might be contaminated.
36283,PS3,6,648.0,654.56,6.56,3.0,"Second of all, gives instructions to the person that said sorry in turn like."
36283,PS3,6,655.16,656.52,1.36,2.0,So basically prediction.
36283,PS3,6,656.56,659.68,3.12,2.0,Prediction for the word sorry coming up and then there's loud beep.
36283,PS3,6,660.28,667.2,6.92,2.0,"But if it fails and the person is still able to say sorry, then it just like alarms, triggers the alarm when like it's."
36283,PS3,6,667.48,681.6,14.12,4.0,"Done not not only alarm, because if you're infractical with the story, you should avoid to this you you should more conscience what you're saying and the follow very very tough limitation of your wording maybe."
36283,PS3,6,681.76,684.36,2.6,2.0,"Yeah, I'm just trying to combine ideas 5:00 and 7:00."
36283,PS3,6,684.6,692.92,8.32,3.0,"The question is, if you say sorry and you're healthy, do you still transmit for the fact or it's?"
36283,PS3,6,693.24,695.04,1.8,2.0,I think this word sorry itself is.
36283,PS3,6,695.08,696.44,1.36,1.0,"That no time, no time, no time."
36283,PS3,6,699.28,701.52,2.24,3.0,"Sorry, voice tracker alerts person."
36283,PS3,6,702.08,702.36,0.28,1.0,And.
36283,PS3,6,702.72,704.64,1.92,3.0,Then say sorry by.
36283,PS3,6,704.88,705.52,0.64,1.0,Surrounding.
36283,PS3,6,705.52,705.96,0.44,1.0,Surrounding.
36283,PS3,6,706.52,714.6,8.08,2.0,"Individuals, I think that's OK."
36283,PS3,6,715.4,718.2,2.8,3.0,5 seconds that's not within a close distance.
35850,PS2,3,8.4,11.88,3.48,1.0,"OK, slightly less interesting than the last one."
35850,PS2,3,12.12,12.72,0.6,2.0,Perhaps.
35850,PS2,3,18.72,19.24,0.52,1.0,Uncontrolled.
35850,PS2,3,19.24,20.64,1.4,1.0,Cost inefficient.
35850,PS2,3,20.68,27.84,7.16,2.0,"I mean, is this talking about nationalizing your supply chain?"
35850,PS2,3,28.68,29.04,0.36,1.0,I don't know.
35850,PS2,3,29.04,32.96,3.92,1.0,I guess it what what vulnerabilities are we talking about?
35850,PS2,3,33.72,49.16,15.44,2.0,"I guess, I guess they mean, you know, when you're shipping, obviously you've got more risks of things getting lost, you've got to pay for intermediaries, all that sort of stuff, rather than just going from within your country."
35850,PS2,3,50.0,55.56,5.56,1.0,"Yeah, I suppose there's supply chain bottlenecks and stuff because that was a big thing during COVID."
35850,PS2,3,55.56,60.6,5.04,1.0,Like the ships weren't in the right places so they couldn't move things around and.
35850,PS2,3,61.24,66.4,5.16,3.0,Doing bigger fines like for human errors or like.
35850,PS2,3,68.4,70.08,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, but who?"
35850,PS2,3,70.28,72.24,1.96,1.0,Who do we think we we are?
35850,PS2,3,72.36,76.2,3.84,1.0,"Are we the government in this case, or are we a firm with the supply chain?"
35850,PS2,3,76.52,91.16,14.64,2.0,"Maybe we're the global firm and we're worried about becoming vulnerable to these uncontrolled costs, but I'm hesitant to want to nationalise my supply chain because I know that outsourcing is probably cheaper."
35850,PS2,3,92.12,94.2,2.08,1.0,"Yeah, maybe you."
35850,PS2,3,94.48,95.52,1.04,2.0,Know compared to Vantage.
35850,PS2,3,96.68,97.28,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, true."
35850,PS2,3,97.28,111.92,14.64,1.0,"Maybe like redundancies, so like having more suppliers and strictly necessary just in case sort of one transportation route goes down and one country is suddenly sanctioned."
35850,PS2,3,113.08,116.36,3.28,2.0,Having having backup a contingency plan.
35850,PS2,3,116.84,117.24,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, sure."
35850,PS2,3,118.96,122.88,3.92,2.0,Do you mean having like more than one like supplier?
35850,PS2,3,123.32,125.72,2.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, maybe, but I'm not sure."
35850,PS2,3,125.76,126.28,0.52,2.0,How expensive?
35850,PS2,3,127.08,132.84,5.76,1.0,"Yeah, it's but maybe less expensive than losing your supply chain suddenly."
35850,PS2,3,132.84,134.72,1.88,1.0,True depends on.
35850,PS2,3,135.28,136.0,0.72,2.0,The risks I guess.
35850,PS2,3,138.36,141.12,2.76,1.0,It's also not that creative an idea.
35850,PS2,3,141.4,145.2,3.8,3.0,"We think like the air degree, you know, out of box."
35850,PS2,3,145.96,146.2,0.24,1.0,I guess.
35850,PS2,3,146.48,148.12,1.64,3.0,"Yeah, I I just don't know what."
35850,PS2,3,148.6,156.56,7.96,1.0,Like it's like it really depends what they mean by vulnerabilities when you want to do because sometimes it's like a geopolitical thing.
35850,PS2,3,157.12,158.76,1.64,2.0,"I think, yeah."
35850,PS2,3,159.4,161.12,1.72,1.0,Sometimes it's like logistics.
35850,PS2,3,165.68,174.4,8.72,2.0,Is there any incentive that we could make that to minimise these inefficient delivery schedules?
35850,PS2,3,174.4,178.56,4.16,2.0,"I don't know, like you, you give more money to if it's done on time."
35850,PS2,3,180.56,185.84,5.28,1.0,"Yeah, or if because it's, it's only asking us to tackle supply chain security."
35850,PS2,3,185.84,196.68,10.84,1.0,"So maybe we are a government and we want to make sure that the same way you want, you know, you're regulating financial companies to, you know, hedging its risks."
35850,PS2,3,197.08,201.84,4.76,1.0,Maybe you're trying to get your international firms to tackle supply.
35850,PS2,3,201.84,216.2,14.36,1.0,"So maybe you subsidise firms who might have, maybe you subsidise redundancy for your firms or I don't know."
35850,PS2,3,219.0,220.76,1.76,1.0,And I suppose we should we should decide with.
35850,PS2,3,221.28,223.24,1.96,2.0,A creative idea to a boring question.
35850,PS2,3,223.56,223.96,0.4,1.0,Yeah.
35850,PS2,3,225.0,229.36,4.36,1.0,So we should we should decide who we think we are and what we think the vulnerability is.
35850,PS2,3,230.08,235.2,5.12,2.0,"I think we're just, we're just trying to address the uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery."
35850,PS2,3,235.2,238.72,3.52,1.0,"Schedules, yeah, but what's what's causing what's causing that?"
35850,PS2,3,238.72,242.56,3.84,2.0,"Well, you know, yeah, outsourcing, I guess."
35850,PS2,3,246.04,248.12,2.08,2.0,Just how like you don't own it.
35850,PS2,3,248.32,257.92,9.6,2.0,You could give subsidies to firms which manage their whole supply chain so they own the factory wherever.
35850,PS2,3,260.36,265.04,4.68,1.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35850,PS2,3,265.04,275.84,10.8,1.0,"Yeah, sort of subsidise, like have an industrial policy where you're subsidising your firms, buying out their vertical suppliers."
35850,PS2,3,276.36,276.72,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS2,3,277.12,278.08,0.96,2.0,Do you want to encourage that?
35850,PS2,3,278.56,278.88,0.32,2.0,Well.
35850,PS2,3,279.72,282.0,2.28,1.0,"Rajiv, would you would."
35850,PS2,3,286.24,286.92,0.68,1.0,"Yeah, so do we."
35850,PS2,3,286.92,293.0,6.08,2.0,"Because because then at least, at least you then own the whole supply chain, I guess."
35850,PS2,3,296.68,301.36,4.68,2.0,Is that better than just encouraging the whole supply chain to be within your country?
35850,PS2,3,304.28,304.4,0.12,1.0,OK.
35850,PS2,3,304.44,306.68,2.24,1.0,It depends what I guess what the risk is.
35850,PS2,3,313.48,316.84,3.36,2.0,"Because you can have your rules of origin, you know, but."
35850,PS2,3,317.36,318.44,1.08,1.0,"That's good, yeah."
35850,PS2,3,320.24,335.68,15.44,2.0,"So you know if or or you, you lobby your governments to make agreements with certain countries and say you."
35850,PS2,3,337.6,337.76,0.16,1.0,Know.
35850,PS2,3,338.2,339.68,1.48,2.0,Please give priority to.
35850,PS2,3,343.0,343.48,0.48,1.0,US OK.
35850,PS2,3,346.52,358.2,11.68,1.0,So you could probably bundle that all together into like like policy of securing your supply chains through diplomacy and acquisition.
35850,PS2,3,358.48,367.28,8.8,2.0,"Yeah, I guess recently people have been trying to secure their supply chains with only outsourcing to political allies."
35850,PS2,3,394.3,402.22,7.92,3.0,"Are we talking about like shipping like, yeah, within the country or within like the city or like."
35850,PS2,3,402.58,406.86,4.28,2.0,I think we're just getting things getting lost along the way.
35850,PS2,3,407.42,413.32,5.9,2.0,"Or, for example, your enemy could could literally just man ships going out."
35850,PS2,3,416.2,417.68,1.48,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35850,PS2,3,419.24,432.04,12.8,3.0,"I feel like if it's like shipping in like 5 Volt, what if you know like some like cities have like special lane for the buses and."
35850,PS2,3,432.04,432.2,0.16,2.0,The.
35850,PS2,3,432.64,440.88,8.24,3.0,The same like like not like big vans and it's less likely to be.
35850,PS2,3,441.84,444.56,2.72,2.0,"True, you could You could have more provisions for."
35850,PS2,3,445.2,446.48,1.28,3.0,Like transition.
35850,PS2,3,446.8,453.44,6.64,3.0,So like for cargo to be like less stressful?
35850,PS2,3,453.44,453.96,0.52,2.0,Maybe.
35850,PS2,3,453.96,456.48,2.52,2.0,Maybe they get priority over cruise ships.
35850,PS2,3,456.84,459.04,2.2,3.0,Or something for cruise.
35850,PS2,3,459.04,463.12,4.08,3.0,It's like you cannot really do like a special Rd.
35850,PS2,3,463.12,463.88,0.76,3.0,for them I guess.
35850,PS2,3,466.48,473.72,7.24,2.0,"You can give them priority in the lanes, but then the Suez Canal and you know, the Panama, well, it's a long queue anyway."
35850,PS2,3,475.08,477.12,2.04,3.0,Or like special place in the port.
35850,PS2,3,478.4,478.76,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS2,3,479.36,481.28,1.92,3.0,Which they probably already have.
35850,PS2,3,484.32,486.68,2.36,2.0,I mean these cargo ships like it's just.
35850,PS2,3,492.04,499.16,7.12,3.0,"Like, they're going to have this, like, special place, like parking for, yeah, people like these disabilities."
35850,PS2,3,500.68,502.56,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, like just more."
35850,PS2,3,503.6,504.52,0.92,3.0,Prioritised.
35850,PS2,3,505.16,507.92,2.76,2.0,Priority for cargo imports.
35850,PS2,3,508.92,523.76,14.84,3.0,"At the top and like people going to know where like leave their stuff, where is there like let's say storage is or I'm not very good at supply chain, but yeah."
35850,PS2,3,525.32,531.4,6.08,2.0,I think it's a bit of a open question.
35850,PS2,3,532.2,533.12,0.92,1.0,"Yes, it."
35850,PS2,3,533.32,534.32,1.0,3.0,"Should be like creative, not?"
35850,PS2,3,534.56,535.76,1.2,3.0,"There's no right answer, right?"
35850,PS2,3,535.8,536.08,0.28,3.0,No.
35850,PS2,3,536.88,543.44,6.56,1.0,"No, I think there's a chance they don't even look at our answer and it's just listening to us talk now."
35850,PS2,3,549.6,552.12,2.52,1.0,"OK, I'm sort of happy with that."
35850,PS2,3,552.88,556.36,3.48,1.0,It is an answer we can.
35177,PS1,6,0.88,1.84,0.96,1.0,Plastic waste.
35177,PS1,6,1.84,8.4,6.56,2.0,"Is one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime, so."
35177,PS1,6,8.4,10.72,2.32,1.0,In several countries they actually do this.
35177,PS1,6,10.72,11.6,0.88,2.0,Net thing.
35177,PS1,6,12.96,16.64,3.68,1.0,Where in a lot of the water bodies and rivers and things.
35177,PS1,6,16.64,17.12,0.48,2.0,Like that?
35177,PS1,6,17.48,23.4,5.92,1.0,What they do is they create a mesh in several with several different perforation.
35177,PS1,6,23.4,23.92,0.52,2.0,Levels.
35177,PS1,6,24.36,27.68,3.32,1.0,Just so that plastic can kind of be filtered out.
35177,PS1,6,27.68,29.36,1.68,2.0,So that is one thing I can think of.
35177,PS1,6,31.24,31.8,0.56,1.0,Any solutions?
35177,PS1,6,31.8,31.96,0.16,2.0,How the?
35177,PS1,6,31.96,33.76,1.8,3.0,Plastic filter.
35177,PS1,6,34.6,37.64,3.04,1.0,"So when you create a mesh in, let's say a."
35177,PS1,6,37.64,38.8,1.16,2.0,Corner or.
35177,PS1,6,39.48,43.6,4.12,1.0,So because we don't think of rivers or water bodies as a linear.
35177,PS1,6,43.6,44.44,0.84,2.0,"Structure, right?"
35177,PS1,6,44.96,46.48,1.52,1.0,So when they are especially.
35177,PS1,6,46.48,49.0,2.52,2.0,At a certain corner and diverging.
35177,PS1,6,49.32,56.08,6.76,1.0,What we what a lot of countries do is they in those corners because the water heats there are these perforation like.
35177,PS1,6,56.52,71.64,15.12,1.0,"Think of it like a filter or a sieve, so that with various, you know, sizes of the holes and perforations, the plastic would automatically get, the water would flow through, and the plastic would."
35177,PS1,6,71.64,72.12,0.48,2.0,"Kind of, yeah."
35177,PS1,6,72.8,73.0,0.2,1.0,So.
35177,PS1,6,73.0,73.24,0.24,2.0,That is.
35177,PS1,6,73.24,73.72,0.48,1.0,Something.
35177,PS1,6,73.72,80.04,6.32,2.0,"That is done in several countries, so that's one, but I'm sure."
35177,PS1,6,80.48,82.6,2.12,4.0,"Yeah, maybe we can just write that down."
35177,PS1,6,82.6,82.8,0.2,4.0,"Yeah, it."
35177,PS1,6,82.8,83.08,0.28,3.0,Depends.
35177,PS1,6,83.36,84.36,1.0,3.0,The rest might be.
35177,PS1,6,88.0,89.44,1.44,5.0,Put on something and later.
35177,PS1,6,89.56,89.64,0.08,3.0,On.
35177,PS1,6,89.72,90.44,0.72,4.0,"OK, sure."
35177,PS1,6,91.16,93.44,2.28,4.0,"Do do any of you oh, we have a oh, oh you do."
35177,PS1,6,93.84,94.48,0.64,3.0,Have a like.
35177,PS1,6,94.76,95.24,0.48,2.0,Oh yeah.
35177,PS1,6,97.76,99.52,1.76,4.0,Can I use the this is white water there's.
35177,PS1,6,99.6,100.64,1.04,1.0,"A market, Oh."
35177,PS1,6,100.64,105.92,5.28,4.0,"Yeah, So what should I call it?"
35177,PS1,6,106.04,107.0,0.96,4.0,A perforation.
35177,PS1,6,107.44,109.16,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, maybe a filter?"
35177,PS1,6,110.44,111.48,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, filter neck or something."
35177,PS1,6,113.52,114.32,0.8,1.0,That is 1.
35177,PS1,6,114.56,117.36,2.8,1.0,"I think we only need one, but irrespective, let's just."
35177,PS1,6,117.6,118.76,1.16,3.0,Reinstall more.
35177,PS1,6,119.16,120.12,0.96,4.0,The ideas that we come up.
35177,PS1,6,120.6,122.32,1.72,1.0,"With while creative, yeah, absolutely."
35177,PS1,6,123.48,128.04,4.56,4.0,I think you could try to also think about it from How can we avoid plastic pollution?
35177,PS1,6,128.04,128.44,0.4,4.0,To begin.
35177,PS1,6,128.44,128.64,0.2,3.0,With.
35177,PS1,6,129.4,130.48,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, so."
35177,PS1,6,131.4,136.04,4.64,4.0,"And you know, incentivize people to not pollute in the 1st place."
35177,PS1,6,136.04,140.64,4.6,4.0,"So like in Germany, I know they have like this bottle return system, they can get paid, there's certain amount."
35177,PS1,6,141.24,142.08,0.84,1.0,"For to reset, yeah."
35177,PS1,6,142.92,143.04,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35177,PS1,6,146.52,157.4,10.88,5.0,"And I think in some labs in Senate war and also in China, they, they kind of like have this kind of micro, micro organisms who can eat the classics actually."
35177,PS1,6,157.68,158.08,0.4,5.0,"Oh, wow."
35177,PS1,6,158.2,158.48,0.28,5.0,Yeah.
35177,PS1,6,158.48,169.32,10.84,5.0,"But I think one problem with that is if you introduce a, a novel Organism to a body, you know, an ecosystem, it might cause some kind of biological hazard that is unanticipated."
35177,PS1,6,169.52,173.2,3.68,5.0,"So that's one invitation, but it's a, it's a new strategy."
35177,PS1,6,173.2,173.44,0.24,5.0,I was.
35177,PS1,6,174.76,176.56,1.8,3.0,Saying well it depends on how you define creative.
35177,PS1,6,176.6,182.04,5.44,3.0,I feel like the easiest like the non creative one would be just incentivize people did not use that.
35177,PS1,6,182.12,184.04,1.92,3.0,But I don't think it's not the creative idea or not.
35177,PS1,6,192.76,194.8,2.04,4.0,"I mean, I guess it depends on like the way that you want to."
35177,PS1,6,195.2,198.12,2.92,4.0,"You could you could come up with an incentivization scheme, that is."
35177,PS1,6,199.64,200.72,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35177,PS1,6,201.0,201.4,0.4,3.0,That's true.
35177,PS1,6,202.12,204.44,2.32,3.0,I mean it says reduce plastic pollution.
35177,PS1,6,204.44,225.48,21.04,3.0,"So it's think of two strands like 1 is you reduce generation and the other is you take out the current plastic, which is the second one you can think of like climate finance that you enable companies like enable research and development in that is instead of 1 idea, you just want to build an ecosystem with."
35177,PS1,6,225.96,229.04,3.08,3.0,But either companies or people can come up with their own.
35177,PS1,6,229.56,232.32,2.76,3.0,I like we just want enabling mechanism.
35177,PS1,6,232.32,233.8,1.48,3.0,I don't want one solution to the.
35177,PS1,6,233.8,234.08,0.28,5.0,Problem.
35177,PS1,6,234.52,236.64,2.12,3.0,"Because there won't be one solution across the world, right I?"
35177,PS1,6,243.48,246.8,3.32,1.0,Think maybe also alternate use of.
35177,PS1,6,246.8,248.36,1.56,2.0,"Conventional plastic, right?"
35177,PS1,6,248.36,248.64,0.28,1.0,Like.
35177,PS1,6,249.16,250.2,1.04,2.0,For example.
35177,PS1,6,250.92,255.4,4.48,1.0,"If we were to use, let's say I'm not saying paper here, but other."
35177,PS1,6,255.56,256.96,1.4,2.0,Forms of materials.
35177,PS1,6,256.96,259.24,2.28,1.0,That could potentially substitute plastic.
35177,PS1,6,259.72,260.92,1.2,1.0,That is something that a lot of.
35177,PS1,6,261.64,262.28,0.64,2.0,Things are.
35177,PS1,6,262.96,264.32,1.36,2.0,So maybe substitution and?
35177,PS1,6,266.0,266.96,0.96,4.0,Also you think?
35177,PS1,6,267.32,270.24,2.92,4.0,"Yeah, non zinc leaves, I think."
35177,PS1,6,272.08,278.68,6.6,5.0,"Or like redesign the packaging of for example, instead of a plastic bottle, you can design it in another way."
35177,PS1,6,278.84,283.52,4.68,5.0,"After you drink it, you can, for example, unfold it and make it to something else."
35177,PS1,6,283.68,283.92,0.24,5.0,Yeah.
35177,PS1,6,284.32,284.68,0.36,3.0,That's true.
35177,PS1,6,285.36,288.6,3.24,3.0,I've heard recently of eatable plates.
35177,PS1,6,288.72,291.0,2.28,3.0,So first you eat the food off of the plate and then you eat the plate.
35177,PS1,6,291.0,291.56,0.56,1.0,Eat the plate.
35177,PS1,6,294.04,295.08,1.04,5.0,That's like an ice cream.
35177,PS1,6,295.6,295.96,0.36,3.0,That's true.
35177,PS1,6,295.96,296.36,0.4,3.0,That's true.
35177,PS1,6,296.36,296.48,0.12,3.0,OK.
35177,PS1,6,303.36,303.48,0.12,6.0,So.
35177,PS1,6,303.56,304.04,0.48,4.0,I I.
35177,PS1,6,304.08,326.64,22.56,6.0,"Think sensitization also is very important that when when there is enough sensitization, many people will get unconsciously aware of the fact that plastic is an environmental problem and they become personally responsible to."
35177,PS1,6,327.44,327.76,0.32,2.0,You know.
35177,PS1,6,328.08,330.36,2.28,6.0,Reducing the pollution that comes with the.
35177,PS1,6,330.4,330.72,0.32,1.0,Use of.
35177,PS1,6,330.72,333.52,2.8,2.0,"Plastics sensible, I think."
35177,PS1,6,337.8,347.68,9.88,4.0,"What's quite interesting about that is that a lot of children get this at school, but it's it's more like the adults that are not necessarily like interacting with, you know, research."
35177,PS1,6,347.68,348.44,0.76,4.0,"And yeah, that's true."
35177,PS1,6,355.04,355.52,0.48,2.0,I think in.
35177,PS1,6,355.52,361.76,6.24,1.0,"Several areas like they have started using a lot of these awareness, I mean they put up placards and things."
35177,PS1,6,361.76,362.16,0.4,2.0,Like that?
35177,PS1,6,362.2,362.88,0.68,1.0,Don't pollute.
35177,PS1,6,362.88,363.24,0.36,2.0,Don't.
35177,PS1,6,363.6,366.56,2.96,1.0,"So those are, I think sense set of reminders."
35177,PS1,6,366.8,374.56,7.76,2.0,"Just going back to the point that she was making, OK, I think we have it 6-7, yeah, 6, right."
35177,PS1,6,377.16,381.96,4.8,2.0,Do we want to maybe vote online or something or?
35177,PS1,6,382.76,384.4,1.64,1.0,Just combine a couple.
35177,PS1,6,384.68,385.12,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, just."
35177,PS1,6,385.92,391.52,5.6,3.0,"Adding one from taking offers, one is incentives to reduce usage, maybe incentives to recite."
35177,PS1,6,391.8,394.12,2.32,3.0,So it's similar to the bottle of recycling one.
35177,PS1,6,394.12,394.4,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35177,PS1,6,394.8,397.28,2.48,3.0,"Oh yeah, it's that there, that's, yeah, it's that already, actually."
35177,PS1,6,397.6,406.96,9.36,4.0,"OK, I guess like another idea I had which maybe could tie these together is trying to think about it as like a circular."
35177,PS1,6,407.2,407.88,0.68,2.0,Economy.
35177,PS1,6,409.08,422.0,12.92,4.0,"So that yeah, so so that maybe this sort of like deep into like a loop recycle and it gets turned into."
35177,PS1,6,424.56,425.44,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, then maybe."
35177,PS1,6,425.44,428.76,3.32,2.0,We can something.
35177,PS1,6,428.76,430.6,1.84,1.0,"Like that, we can start off with how?"
35177,PS1,6,430.72,432.84,2.12,2.0,Sensitization and education.
35177,PS1,6,433.6,434.72,1.12,1.0,Leads to.
35177,PS1,6,435.04,435.8,0.76,2.0,This thing but.
35177,PS1,6,435.8,437.0,1.2,1.0,"Coupled with that, we also."
35177,PS1,6,437.0,440.52,3.52,2.0,Need financing for some of the recycling as well as.
35177,PS1,6,440.52,441.88,1.36,1.0,Alternate activities.
35177,PS1,6,442.68,443.16,0.48,2.0,Further.
35177,PS1,6,443.16,447.04,3.88,1.0,"To that, that financing can go into research for microbial."
35177,PS1,6,447.2,448.16,0.96,2.0,Degradation.
35177,PS1,6,449.6,451.72,2.12,1.0,Though we can probably KV it that it.
35177,PS1,6,451.72,452.64,0.92,2.0,Could be harmful.
35177,PS1,6,453.08,453.96,0.88,1.0,I know that's a couple of.
35177,PS1,6,453.96,454.6,0.64,2.0,Solutions.
35177,PS1,6,454.6,457.84,3.24,2.0,"But you know, something like that."
35177,PS1,6,459.68,460.32,0.64,5.0,"Can work, Yes."
35177,PS1,6,460.32,460.84,0.52,5.0,"Yes, ecosystem."
35177,PS1,6,460.84,461.28,0.44,5.0,Find out.
35177,PS1,6,461.64,463.16,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, two more."
35177,PS1,6,464.88,466.96,2.08,4.0,Right I I don't mind if anyone wants to.
35177,PS1,6,468.72,469.4,0.68,1.0,Go for it.
35177,PS1,6,472.28,487.72,15.44,4.0,"OK, so close the circular economy."
35177,PS1,6,487.96,488.2,0.24,4.0,Sorry.
35177,PS1,6,488.2,490.08,1.88,4.0,"Do you have the the time, how much time we have left?"
35177,PS1,6,490.76,491.44,0.68,4.0,"Sorry, 3."
35177,PS1,6,491.8,493.08,1.28,1.0,Minutes so now.
35177,PS1,6,494.56,498.16,3.6,2.0,There's less than 4 minutes.
35177,PS1,6,499.32,502.52,3.2,4.0,Whereby restart.
35177,PS1,6,503.68,504.28,0.6,3.0,By.
35177,PS1,6,506.2,510.12,3.92,4.0,Educating and sensitizing.
35177,PS1,6,528.56,529.36,0.8,4.0,How's that happen?
35177,PS1,6,544.68,546.32,1.64,4.0,Feel free to stop me at any point.
35177,PS1,6,576.8,579.56,2.76,1.0,Can we also put recycled plastic?
35177,PS1,6,579.68,580.28,0.6,2.0,And.
35177,PS1,6,581.52,582.04,0.52,1.0,Create.
35177,PS1,6,582.04,585.84,3.8,2.0,Alternate uses of materials.
35177,PS1,6,585.84,588.2,2.36,1.0,Or something so we also include the alternates.
35177,PS1,6,588.2,589.2,1.0,2.0,And non send videos.
35177,PS1,6,589.32,589.96,0.64,4.0,Yes.
35177,PS1,6,636.28,636.56,0.28,4.0,Yeah.
35177,PS1,6,636.56,643.84,7.28,4.0,And and then we do we should we talk about how?
35177,PS1,6,644.72,646.04,1.32,3.0,Do you have incentivisation?
35177,PS1,6,680.07,684.51,4.44,4.0,How to value monetise?
35177,PS1,6,699.19,700.47,1.28,4.0,"Yeah, OK."
35401,PS5,3,11.72,12.32,0.6,1.0,What I?
35401,PS5,3,12.48,12.92,0.44,1.0,What is?
35401,PS5,3,13.24,13.84,0.6,1.0,What is?
35401,PS5,3,14.4,16.64,2.24,2.0,I imagine like when you just decide to leave the.
35401,PS5,3,16.72,17.6,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, when just."
35401,PS5,3,18.44,21.64,3.2,2.0,"Yeah, I don't understand the word, but yeah, makes sense."
35401,PS5,3,22.56,23.8,1.24,1.0,I'm not native speakers.
35401,PS5,3,24.64,24.96,0.32,3.0,Same.
35401,PS5,3,27.88,28.44,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, I guess from."
35401,PS5,3,28.68,30.08,1.4,2.0,The context.
35401,PS5,3,30.24,30.56,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,40.2,41.56,1.36,1.0,"Well, that's very broad."
35401,PS5,3,41.92,42.16,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,44.64,46.28,1.64,3.0,The topic suddenly changes.
35401,PS5,3,54.32,62.32,8.0,1.0,"Well, so it says value talent, so I guess it's like."
35401,PS5,3,63.64,68.52,4.88,2.0,"When you leave because you're not happy, yeah, job and you want to go to a better company."
35401,PS5,3,68.52,71.92,3.4,1.0,Or maybe when when your ideas are not listened to or.
35401,PS5,3,72.4,72.68,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,82.72,83.96,1.24,1.0,That's tricky because.
35401,PS5,3,85.6,86.0,0.4,3.0,I think.
35401,PS5,3,86.04,92.68,6.64,1.0,"The yeah, if you, if you and I'll do something like pay more people, who wants to live?"
35401,PS5,3,92.68,94.76,2.08,1.0,"It's like everybody's going to ask for a living, right?"
35401,PS5,3,95.44,95.72,0.28,1.0,So.
35401,PS5,3,96.96,115.32,18.36,3.0,I think one thing to stop this by giving a benefit to them like maybe if you work for a certain time you will got this car or more than that you will get this apartment or a room or somewhere or you have like your accuracy bill for a year will be cut off if you but.
35401,PS5,3,117.44,119.32,1.88,1.0,It doesn't have to be monetary.
35401,PS5,3,120.32,121.12,0.8,3.0,Create either.
35401,PS5,3,121.52,124.0,2.48,1.0,And I think so because otherwise that would happen.
35401,PS5,3,124.32,125.04,0.72,1.0,Or like.
35401,PS5,3,126.36,126.72,0.36,3.0,I think.
35401,PS5,3,126.92,131.88,4.96,1.0,It's have to be why we have to think about why people leave the company 1st.
35401,PS5,3,132.76,132.96,0.2,2.0,Why?
35401,PS5,3,134.36,141.56,7.2,2.0,"Yeah, because they're not like good, like the conditions are not good in terms of like, payment, like salary."
35401,PS5,3,141.88,145.32,3.44,2.0,"Yeah, or like harassment."
35401,PS5,3,145.64,146.52,0.88,3.0,Or environment.
35401,PS5,3,146.64,155.28,8.64,2.0,"Environment or yeah, like or because they've decided that they don't like that anymore."
35401,PS5,3,155.96,156.2,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,156.2,163.44,7.24,1.0,But imagine that the OK that everything like so the salary is good.
35401,PS5,3,164.44,170.64,6.2,1.0,"I mean, I think we'll have to start with that because like because otherwise could be the."
35401,PS5,3,170.64,172.88,2.24,3.0,"One thing, yeah, yeah, we need to start with the Y Yeah."
35401,PS5,3,173.24,173.4,0.16,3.0,So.
35401,PS5,3,173.68,175.44,1.76,1.0,"Yeah, like in the sense that I think."
35401,PS5,3,175.8,177.04,1.24,2.0,Maybe just like assume?
35401,PS5,3,177.04,179.24,2.2,1.0,Assume that the conditions are OK.
35401,PS5,3,179.56,179.84,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,180.56,188.32,7.76,1.0,"And you are, I don't know, a valuable, talented person who has, I don't know, physicist or something like that."
35401,PS5,3,191.16,193.36,2.2,1.0,"And yeah, and you just decide to leave."
35401,PS5,3,193.6,194.44,0.84,1.0,But why do you think?
35401,PS5,3,195.2,198.44,3.24,2.0,So it could be because you're it's a good company.
35401,PS5,3,198.6,200.08,1.48,1.0,You have a good environment.
35401,PS5,3,200.08,200.88,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, everything."
35401,PS5,3,201.08,205.72,4.64,2.0,But like you feel like you could be more and they don't have the resources to give with us.
35401,PS5,3,206.44,207.44,1.0,2.0,So everything's good.
35401,PS5,3,207.44,211.44,4.0,2.0,But you cannot like grow.
35401,PS5,3,211.48,212.04,0.56,2.0,Grow.
35401,PS5,3,212.16,212.96,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35401,PS5,3,213.16,221.96,8.8,2.0,"So you may be want to go to another place, but how do you do in a creative way?"
35401,PS5,3,222.36,222.72,0.36,3.0,You are.
35401,PS5,3,223.64,227.6,3.96,1.0,Are you giving more freedom or to freedom like of?
35401,PS5,3,229.72,231.84,2.12,3.0,Freedom to choose or.
35401,PS5,3,232.24,232.32,0.08,2.0,To.
35401,PS5,3,232.32,232.8,0.48,1.0,Do to.
35401,PS5,3,232.92,233.76,0.84,3.0,Do their work.
35401,PS5,3,234.68,240.32,5.64,1.0,Maybe giving more freedom of management like their ideas?
35401,PS5,3,240.52,243.76,3.24,3.0,Remove certain limitation on how their ideas are going to work.
35401,PS5,3,245.0,247.8,2.8,1.0,I mean living more.
35401,PS5,3,247.8,249.04,1.24,1.0,I don't know how to say.
35401,PS5,3,249.04,254.08,5.04,1.0,It's like living them more freedom of doing stuff.
35401,PS5,3,254.48,260.2,5.72,1.0,So instead of like you have to do this in this particular way maybe?
35401,PS5,3,261.0,261.64,0.64,3.0,You have this like.
35401,PS5,3,261.64,262.92,1.28,1.0,"That's tricky, actually."
35401,PS5,3,263.76,267.72,3.96,3.0,"Because this is a broad question, yeah, could be anything."
35401,PS5,3,267.72,268.8,1.08,3.0,The reason they're living?
35401,PS5,3,270.72,273.76,3.04,1.0,"We'll have 7 minutes, no pressure."
35401,PS5,3,277.24,277.88,0.64,3.0,I am.
35401,PS5,3,281.32,283.16,1.84,2.0,Could you like implement some kind of?
35401,PS5,3,283.16,286.08,2.92,2.0,I don't know.
35401,PS5,3,290.4,291.2,0.8,1.0,Like bonus.
35401,PS5,3,291.2,303.68,12.48,2.0,Like bonus or like maybe you can like leave your requests for like improvement within the company every month or I don't know.
35401,PS5,3,305.44,305.8,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,306.4,312.6,6.2,2.0,Or like improvement in like many areas because you could be like salary wise or like more responsibility.
35401,PS5,3,312.6,317.2,4.6,2.0,Maybe you want more responsibility and they're not giving it to you or like things like that.
35401,PS5,3,317.96,319.44,1.48,2.0,"I don't know how creative that is, but."
35401,PS5,3,320.76,322.16,1.4,3.0,Giving room to be heard.
35401,PS5,3,322.56,323.52,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35401,PS5,3,323.52,335.92,12.4,2.0,"And like maybe not like personal way because maybe that would create more like problems, but like in AI don't."
35401,PS5,3,337.08,337.68,0.6,3.0,Want for this?
35401,PS5,3,337.88,338.16,0.28,3.0,Yeah.

35401,PS5,3,345.32,347.88,2.56,2.0,"We can think about other things in the meantime, OK?"
35401,PS5,3,362.28,369.32,7.04,1.0,"And a budget for it, like it could be a budget within the company for new ideas."
35401,PS5,3,369.36,369.68,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35401,PS5,3,370.08,370.52,0.44,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."

35401,PS5,3,372.48,373.8,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, it could be."
35401,PS5,3,373.8,374.8,1.0,3.0,"OK, so."
35401,PS5,3,375.12,375.4,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,375.64,391.08,15.44,3.0,In a form of budget for a budget to make their their and they're one they're inside they're to.
35401,PS5,3,392.56,400.2,7.64,1.0,It could be in the form of of budget to make their budget to implement.
35401,PS5,3,400.44,405.48,5.04,1.0,I would say budget to implement to the best new ideas.
35401,PS5,3,406.48,407.16,0.68,3.0,No ideas.
35401,PS5,3,408.2,414.88,6.68,1.0,"So for example, it could be like monthly meeting or something like that to brainstorm more like talk about."
35401,PS5,3,415.4,415.72,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,416.16,432.4,16.24,2.0,"And if this hasn't been fulfilled in like X amount of months, then you can like you have to give the the company a bit of time for them to like, implement this, right Or not like would you say like."
35401,PS5,3,432.52,435.96,3.44,2.0,So imagine I want to leave and I go to this meeting.
35401,PS5,3,435.96,441.8,5.84,2.0,"I say I want more, I don't know, more power."
35401,PS5,3,442.92,452.16,9.24,2.0,"And then they cannot give it to you like maybe next day or maybe they could give it to you over the like the course of like one or two months and then like, if not you live."
35401,PS5,3,453.04,455.92,2.88,1.0,"I was thinking more about, you know, instead of a power like."
35401,PS5,3,456.92,460.24,3.32,2.0,"No, I say power but like I mean like for example salary or."
35401,PS5,3,460.48,460.88,0.4,1.0,Whatever.
35401,PS5,3,460.92,477.04,16.12,1.0,"Yeah, but they was thinking more about like some ideas that could benefit the the company that you know that they they weren't supposed to be running and there is no budget for it to be running."
35401,PS5,3,477.52,486.64,9.12,1.0,"But you come up with this that will improve the company and then there's a bad a safe budget for that and then you can I meant that, but."
35401,PS5,3,487.44,489.64,2.2,2.0,Is it going to like prevent people leaving though?
35401,PS5,3,489.96,501.92,11.96,1.0,"Or like, I mean, if they are leaving because they are not hurt about like their ideas, but in this case if they are leaving because they are not well paid, then obviously they will leave anyway, yeah."
35401,PS5,3,517.26,518.82,1.56,3.0,Anything to add?
35401,PS5,3,518.94,528.14,9.2,2.0,"Should we add at the beginning that we're considering like perfect, like not perfect, but like they have good salary?"
35401,PS5,3,528.3,529.54,1.24,1.0,"Yeah, context like."
35401,PS5,3,529.66,530.18,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35401,PS5,3,537.48,538.48,1.0,3.0,Where I.

35401,PS5,3,548.04,552.36,4.32,2.0,And they're not happy because they don't.
35401,PS5,3,553.0,554.76,1.76,2.0,They don't think their ideas are.
35401,PS5,3,555.2,555.44,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35401,PS5,3,555.88,558.48,2.6,3.0,Make hands their idea.

34250,PS3,3,28.8,31.12,2.32,3.0,"You know, I don't know if we can go crazy, we can go crazy."
34250,PS3,3,31.84,32.72,0.88,1.0,Yesterday there was no.
34250,PS3,3,32.72,33.68,0.96,3.0,"Structure, yeah."
34250,PS3,3,35.56,39.04,3.48,1.0,"They were thinking like, OK, So what are the implications of saying the word sorry?"
34250,PS3,3,56.84,58.88,2.04,3.0,"OK, one is way."
34250,PS3,3,59.08,61.44,2.36,3.0,Instead of sorry we can invent a new word.
34250,PS3,3,61.92,69.28,7.36,3.0,"So instead of sorry we can say store those sururi or something, you know a new word."
34250,PS3,3,69.52,70.72,1.2,3.0,So we can replace the word.
34250,PS3,3,70.72,71.68,0.96,3.0,How does that sound?
34250,PS3,3,73.04,75.36,2.32,3.0,So sorry is going to be replaced with another word.
34250,PS3,3,76.16,80.24,4.08,3.0,So we can completely ban the word sorry and replace.
34250,PS3,3,83.0,84.12,1.12,1.0,"Oh, gesture."
34250,PS3,3,85.52,86.08,0.56,3.0,"Oh, OK."
34250,PS3,3,86.2,98.12,11.92,1.0,"So, so we encourage that instead of saying that we're sorry, you slap the gun and."
34250,PS3,3,100.64,102.76,2.12,3.0,Suggest to suggest #1 OK.
34250,PS3,3,103.4,104.6,1.2,2.0,Are we supposed to come up with a bunch?
34250,PS3,3,104.68,108.4,3.72,1.0,"Of yeah, we just need 111 good one, but just one, this is real."
34250,PS3,3,108.4,110.16,1.76,1.0,"And then we just said one, one was 1."
34250,PS3,3,110.72,111.76,1.04,3.0,Should we said that?
34250,PS3,3,111.8,112.8,1.0,3.0,"OK, so we said that."
34250,PS3,3,113.0,116.84,3.84,3.0,"Maybe, just maybe, we replace the word with another."
34250,PS3,3,116.84,118.44,1.6,1.0,Word one other way.
34250,PS3,3,119.76,121.48,1.72,1.0,The word sounds a bit like funky.
34250,PS3,3,121.48,122.84,1.36,1.0,Does it like sunny or something?
34250,PS3,3,123.36,124.76,1.4,3.0,"That doesn't, yeah."
34250,PS3,3,125.0,125.68,0.68,1.0,"Yeah, we can do that."
34250,PS3,3,125.68,126.08,0.4,1.0,We can do that.
34250,PS3,3,130.04,131.52,1.48,1.0,Let's see what this is harder than today.
34250,PS3,3,131.52,132.12,0.6,1.0,Just ban.

35282,PS2,6,416.84,418.28,1.44,4.0,Anyone have big objections to that one?
35282,PS2,6,419.76,422.4,2.64,2.0,I think the physical empowerment 1 is a good idea if I'm honest.
35282,PS2,6,422.4,426.48,4.08,2.0,"Like it's going to make people work, but we want to agree on something."
35282,PS2,6,428.2,436.96,8.76,6.0,"Everything from your producers, from where the farm, everywhere from the shipping process to manufacture."
35282,PS2,6,436.96,437.08,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
35282,PS2,6,437.08,437.48,0.4,4.0,So if you're.
35282,PS2,6,437.48,438.72,1.24,6.0,Saying it reaches the customer.
35282,PS2,6,439.04,442.16,3.12,4.0,"Yeah, we, if you like, go to your supplier and say how fast your work is."
35282,PS2,6,442.76,444.44,1.68,4.0,They need to be able to wear 100 metres.
35282,PS2,6,444.44,445.32,0.88,3.0,And 11 seconds.
35282,PS2,6,445.64,448.12,2.48,2.0,But is that a transferable skill to farming?
35282,PS2,6,448.64,449.28,0.64,3.0,"Yeah, I would say."
35282,PS2,6,449.32,449.8,0.48,2.0,So you think so?
35282,PS2,6,449.96,450.28,0.32,2.0,OK.
35282,PS2,6,451.6,453.04,1.44,4.0,If you can run around a farm quicker.
35282,PS2,6,453.88,455.8,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, I'm not like, genuinely asking."
35282,PS2,6,455.8,456.8,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, if so."
35282,PS2,6,457.28,460.96,3.68,3.0,More physically capable of working on a farm then absolutely your output's going to be.
35282,PS2,6,462.04,465.84,3.8,6.0,"High, I'll give an example of vulnerability within a supply chain."
35282,PS2,6,466.2,478.04,11.84,6.0,"Like when COVID happened, there was a supply chain disruption and company, many companies dependent were dependent on a specific part in their process and those things weren't getting delivered."
35282,PS2,6,479.56,482.84,3.28,6.0,This was a 1 Liberty because they were entirely dependent on one supplier.
35282,PS2,6,483.24,483.52,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35282,PS2,6,484.0,485.56,1.56,6.0,So this would be a form of 1 liberty.
35282,PS2,6,485.6,490.0,4.4,6.0,So how would physical discipline help during that situation?
35282,PS2,6,490.72,491.72,1.0,2.0,That's a good point.
35282,PS2,6,491.92,493.04,1.12,4.0,"Yeah, in that situation."
35282,PS2,6,493.04,502.36,9.32,3.0,"Beforehand, you would have the people that are more physically capable, so they'd build up a bigger inventory before any of these disruptions happens, and then you'd have the ability to send that inventory across that's already been made."
35282,PS2,6,505.0,505.36,0.36,3.0,All right.
35282,PS2,6,506.24,513.2,6.96,6.0,"But then again, having extra inventory and different parts of the supply chain is a huge vulnerability as well."
35282,PS2,6,513.6,517.68,4.08,6.0,That's why there's the lean methodologies that avoid having extra.
35282,PS2,6,518.0,518.16,0.16,4.0,Yeah.
35282,PS2,6,518.16,519.8,1.64,4.0,"So then if you're more physically capable, you can."
35282,PS2,6,519.8,521.72,1.92,3.0,Take the things and move them around quicker.
35282,PS2,6,522.08,522.68,0.6,4.0,So you have less.
35282,PS2,6,522.68,526.12,3.44,3.0,"Inventory build up, you have some more flowing through and it's more efficient."
35282,PS2,6,527.16,530.04,2.88,2.0,It will still put a hole on it if something like that came though.
35282,PS2,6,530.04,536.2,6.16,2.0,"Yeah, you'd have to have more suppliers in order to prevent what you're saying from happening, right?"
35282,PS2,6,536.48,536.6,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35282,PS2,6,537.44,542.36,4.92,6.0,Having just a single day supplier depending on only one is considered a vulnerability is an example.
35282,PS2,6,542.36,544.16,1.8,2.0,"Of a it's a, it's a vulnerability."
35282,PS2,6,544.16,550.64,6.48,2.0,"It's like when you're having incomes, it's better to have incomes from a couple of sources because you may be redundant then well then you've still got income from two other sources."
35282,PS2,6,552.72,553.76,1.04,4.0,"OK, 2 minutes."
35282,PS2,6,554.04,555.04,1.0,3.0,"Rebecca, what do you think?"
35282,PS2,6,559.44,560.56,1.12,2.0,"Well, have you got another idea?"
35282,PS2,6,562.2,562.76,0.56,1.0,"No, not really."
35282,PS2,6,563.28,571.32,8.04,1.0,"Yeah, maybe offer the customer with a free trip to get their things by themselves."
35282,PS2,6,575.96,576.16,0.2,2.0,OK.
35282,PS2,6,576.84,577.76,0.92,4.0,"Well, so if you're saying that."
35282,PS2,6,577.84,578.32,0.48,1.0,Beach trip.
35282,PS2,6,578.4,580.0,1.6,4.0,Say we're going to take you.
35282,PS2,6,580.0,581.32,1.32,3.0,To the beach trip Farm for free.
35282,PS2,6,581.8,582.88,1.08,3.0,You pick your own beach trip.
35282,PS2,6,584.76,585.64,0.88,2.0,I like that idea.
35282,PS2,6,585.64,590.32,4.68,2.0,Make the like customer do the work.
35282,PS2,6,590.56,590.8,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35282,PS2,6,594.52,596.84,2.32,4.0,"Yeah, why not just say look if you want to buy a pack of prints?"
35282,PS2,6,596.84,599.2,2.36,3.0,You need to spend 10 minutes working factory.
35282,PS2,6,599.2,600.48,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, brilliant."
35282,PS2,6,601.16,602.52,1.36,2.0,"Perfect, right make."
35282,PS2,6,602.52,603.72,1.2,1.0,The customer.
35282,PS2,6,603.72,605.88,2.16,2.0,Do the work.
35282,PS2,6,610.04,610.76,0.72,1.0,So if.
35282,PS2,6,610.76,616.8,6.04,2.0,"You would like some carrots, Go and pick them."
35282,PS2,6,618.48,627.16,8.68,2.0,I think people will at that point therefore be less like they will only pick what they actually need so that you have a lot less waste and then.
35282,PS2,6,629.56,630.0,0.44,4.0,You don't.
35282,PS2,6,630.04,631.64,1.6,3.0,Need to employ any workers.
35282,PS2,6,633.44,634.2,0.76,5.0,There's no building.
35282,PS2,6,634.92,637.32,2.4,2.0,So you need the workers for that part I think.
35282,PS2,6,638.16,638.24,0.08,6.0,The.
35282,PS2,6,641.56,645.12,3.56,3.0,"Workers that have been physically, yeah, you don't need the part, OK?"
35282,PS2,6,645.12,646.72,1.6,3.0,Should you do your part?
35282,PS2,6,646.72,649.44,2.72,6.0,I mean it was based on the logistics rule.
35282,PS2,6,649.6,654.92,5.32,2.0,Less employed people also no delivery issues as people have to come and get it the.
35282,PS2,6,659.0,661.04,2.04,6.0,Faster they can have.
35282,PS2,6,665.6,666.64,1.04,1.0,"This stuff the faster they have it, so the."
35282,PS2,6,666.64,666.76,0.12,6.0,More.
35282,PS2,6,668.12,692.92,24.8,2.0,"People that help out along the process, the more they will be able to get from it, IE the idea of an allowance, discounts, What I meant by like the allowance was or you could have, yeah."
35282,PS2,6,693.52,695.8,2.28,2.0,"Or discounts is more, right?"
35282,PS2,6,695.8,698.08,2.28,2.0,You've done 10 hours of work for us.
35282,PS2,6,698.08,702.4,4.32,2.0,Your family can have more than somebody who's only done 10 minutes of work.
35282,PS2,6,703.28,703.8,0.52,6.0,That's medieval.
35282,PS2,6,712.12,716.6,4.48,2.0,"Well, it gets customers involved in the process, so it makes them more 2 seconds."
36321,PS3,6,2.2,2.88,0.68,1.0,Oh my God.
36321,PS3,6,5.84,7.16,1.32,2.0,"Ban the word, sorry."
36321,PS3,6,12.48,18.12,5.64,3.0,"Oh, Minecraft, Reduce its Sprite, Maybe come up with a new word, yeah?"
36321,PS3,6,18.36,21.0,2.64,1.0,"Sorry, actually you can write that."
36321,PS3,6,21.0,22.16,1.16,1.0,"That's the easy one, but."
36321,PS3,6,22.28,25.36,3.08,4.0,There's no difference between the sorry and the new one.
36321,PS3,6,26.04,28.24,2.2,3.0,"Like you can say thank you, but it."
36321,PS3,6,32.2,32.8,0.6,4.0,Means sorry.
36321,PS3,6,33.52,34.96,1.44,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, actually hand gesture."
36321,PS3,6,34.96,36.12,1.16,5.0,"Yeah, you can, yeah."
36321,PS3,6,36.72,37.2,0.48,1.0,You can write.
36321,PS3,6,37.48,39.84,2.36,2.0,Substitute the word sorry by a hand gesture.
36321,PS3,6,39.84,39.96,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36321,PS3,6,40.44,42.2,1.76,4.0,"Just sorry, we do not speak it."
36321,PS3,6,44.32,49.12,4.8,6.0,I think we can sell some new microphone they be sorry be that's.
36321,PS3,6,50.64,52.04,1.4,1.0,Very beautiful.
36321,PS3,6,52.04,52.76,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, that's very."
36321,PS3,6,52.76,53.2,0.44,6.0,Creative.
36321,PS3,6,55.0,55.28,0.28,6.0,Yeah.
36321,PS3,6,63.72,64.44,0.72,5.0,"Yeah, so we."
36321,PS3,6,64.44,67.92,3.48,1.0,Should we should use the second one then yeah.
36321,PS3,6,68.56,68.92,0.36,2.0,But we.
36321,PS3,6,68.92,71.04,2.12,1.0,Have already given like 1000 ideas for the last.
36321,PS3,6,74.0,74.44,0.44,5.0,Not bad.
36321,PS3,6,74.8,75.84,1.04,5.0,Can you write censor?
36321,PS3,6,76.12,79.68,3.56,5.0,"Because yeah, to censor SCENSORCEN."
36321,PS3,6,80.68,81.36,0.68,6.0,SO.
36321,PS3,6,81.92,83.72,1.8,3.0,Why send?
36321,PS3,6,83.84,91.04,7.2,5.0,Send CEN 1st Yeah sensor.
36321,PS3,6,91.44,92.44,1.0,2.0,The word sorry.
36321,PS3,6,94.32,95.84,1.52,1.0,"That's a very cool idea, thank you."
36321,PS3,6,95.84,99.52,3.68,1.0,Never think of that.
35914,PS3,6,0.24,0.84,0.6,1.0,Weird ideas?
35914,PS3,6,1.8,6.28,4.48,2.0,Imagine the pandemic as Marge that is transmitting by saying the word sorry.
35914,PS3,6,6.56,9.44,2.88,2.0,Come up with one creative idea to reduce its speed.
35914,PS3,6,11.32,11.64,0.32,3.0,Reduce its.
35914,PS3,6,11.8,11.96,0.16,1.0,Speed.
35914,PS3,6,12.04,12.24,0.2,1.0,Sorry.
35914,PS3,6,16.0,16.16,0.16,3.0,OK.
35914,PS3,6,22.2,27.08,4.88,4.0,When me and my friends play Uno we have a rule where if you say sorry you get a penalty card.
35914,PS3,6,27.84,29.52,1.68,4.0,So I would just implement that nationwide.
35914,PS3,6,31.76,32.08,0.32,2.0,What would?
35914,PS3,6,32.28,32.76,0.48,3.0,You find.
35914,PS3,6,32.84,33.2,0.36,4.0,"People, yeah."
35914,PS3,6,34.24,34.36,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35914,PS3,6,35.52,35.92,0.4,1.0,Good fines.
35914,PS3,6,36.64,42.88,6.24,3.0,"I don't know in terms of the creativity though, you might need a more playful aspect."
35914,PS3,6,45.88,51.84,5.96,5.0,"I would do an advertising campaign with the synonyms for sorry so that people see them and they come, you know, more."
35914,PS3,6,51.96,54.56,2.6,5.0,They're more easily sort of like accessible from memory.
35914,PS3,6,57.36,57.8,0.44,2.0,Turn people.
35914,PS3,6,57.8,58.56,0.76,1.0,Into Americans.
35914,PS3,6,59.84,62.12,2.28,4.0,"Yeah, no one would ever apologise."
35914,PS3,6,62.4,70.8,8.4,3.0,"Have you ever heard of the Canadian stand off where you know somebody says sorry and then the other says sorry and like, Canadians are super polite, right?"
35914,PS3,6,70.84,74.68,3.84,3.0,"So it's like sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry could maybe."
35914,PS3,6,74.84,77.16,2.32,2.0,"But if they say sorry to each other, it's not going to spread the disease."
35914,PS3,6,77.44,78.88,1.44,2.0,It just has to be that if you're just look.
35914,PS3,6,79.0,80.76,1.76,4.0,A lot of Canadians in a room together.
35914,PS3,6,81.52,82.4,0.88,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35914,PS3,6,82.6,83.08,0.48,2.0,So we.
35914,PS3,6,83.08,83.88,0.8,4.0,Sacrificed them.
35914,PS3,6,84.08,88.24,4.16,2.0,"Contain the I guess like I don't know, endemic population."
35914,PS3,6,88.84,94.64,5.8,6.0,"I got a question, is this specific word sorry or any word related sorry we can we can find out what to substitute right?"
35914,PS3,6,95.04,96.0,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, I think, I think."
35914,PS3,6,96.0,96.4,0.4,1.0,Substitute.
35914,PS3,6,96.48,97.2,0.72,1.0,Definitely want to do.
35914,PS3,6,97.2,98.88,1.68,4.0,Like apologies or something would be fine.
35914,PS3,6,99.28,102.28,3.0,6.0,My dad like saying I said sorry.
35914,PS3,6,102.6,103.0,0.4,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35914,PS3,6,105.8,108.6,2.8,4.0,Do I need to be writing down these ideas all the way to?
35914,PS3,6,108.84,111.76,2.92,2.0,"One, because eventually we have to become like one idea."
35914,PS3,6,112.16,118.12,5.96,2.0,So it's better if we like decide on which exact plan and then maybe perfect that on that for a little bit.
35914,PS3,6,120.32,122.84,2.52,4.0,I think the advertising campaign is a good idea.
35914,PS3,6,122.88,124.2,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, giving."
35914,PS3,6,124.2,130.6,6.4,4.0,"People other things to say, maybe like implementing it into like sitcoms and entertainment as well."
35914,PS3,6,130.68,133.4,2.72,4.0,Just like never have anything to apologize.
35914,PS3,6,134.64,135.68,1.04,4.0,Apologize in a different way.
35914,PS3,6,135.92,136.68,0.76,5.0,"Yeah, that would be good."
35914,PS3,6,136.68,136.8,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35914,PS3,6,137.2,144.88,7.68,5.0,"Because otherwise, I think, like, we find it's very difficult to, like, find everybody who says sorry, and then you would end up like finding only the people you hear say sorry."
35914,PS3,6,145.16,145.44,0.28,5.0,Yeah.
35914,PS3,6,145.56,145.88,0.32,2.0,You still.
35914,PS3,6,145.88,147.32,1.44,5.0,Wouldn't limit the spread I.
35914,PS3,6,147.36,147.6,0.24,1.0,Guess.
35914,PS3,6,148.56,149.92,1.36,4.0,So more like finding.
35914,PS3,6,149.92,151.84,1.92,3.0,A synonymous word for sorry.
35914,PS3,6,152.8,152.92,0.12,1.0,And.
35914,PS3,6,153.16,153.64,0.48,3.0,"Kind of, yeah."
35914,PS3,6,153.68,156.32,2.64,3.0,It could even be like a a gesture like a.
35914,PS3,6,156.6,156.88,0.28,6.0,Yeah.
35914,PS3,6,156.88,157.12,0.24,3.0,A new.
35914,PS3,6,157.12,157.88,0.76,6.0,Gesture you don't have.
35914,PS3,6,157.88,159.6,1.72,3.0,"To say anything, you just."
35914,PS3,6,160.0,160.32,0.32,1.0,That'd be.
35914,PS3,6,160.32,160.64,0.32,5.0,Cool.

34326,PS3,3,1608.16,1617.88,9.72,1.0,"So, OK for the for the physically challenged people."
34326,PS3,3,1618.68,1621.2,2.52,2.0,"For the visually challenged people, we use the sound."
34326,PS3,3,1622.16,1622.8,0.64,1.0,Sound.
34326,PS3,3,1623.24,1624.0,0.76,2.0,The sound if.
34326,PS3,3,1624.0,1625.28,1.28,1.0,You work if you work.
34326,PS3,3,1625.48,1626.64,1.16,1.0,I mean sound.
34326,PS3,3,1627.04,1627.72,0.68,2.0,The sound effect.
34326,PS3,3,1627.72,1633.52,5.8,2.0,"We design the sound effect that means sorry like for example, could be one of them."
34326,PS3,3,1633.52,1634.68,1.16,3.0,But this is called ridiculous.
34326,PS3,3,1634.8,1637.0,2.2,3.0,"If I play the radio, sorry, does the radio get?"
34326,PS3,3,1638.16,1640.96,2.8,2.0,"Yeah, but you are the one playing the radio, so you get the C."
34326,PS3,3,1640.96,1644.56,3.6,3.0,So first in Bone you record the Sorry on the radio.
34326,PS3,3,1644.56,1645.56,1.0,3.0,It's just really reviewed.
34326,PS3,3,1645.56,1647.16,1.6,3.0,"You don't say it, but the machine says it."
34326,PS3,3,1647.4,1648.8,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, that's great."
34326,PS3,3,1649.0,1649.44,0.44,1.0,That's great.
34326,PS3,3,1650.08,1655.56,5.48,2.0,But but does it only mean that if you say it or you are the one triggering it?
34326,PS3,3,1655.68,1656.52,0.84,3.0,What did they say?
34326,PS3,3,1657.0,1659.16,2.16,3.0,They say I assume the person is the transmitter.
34326,PS3,3,1659.84,1664.36,4.52,3.0,"So if you I just play the recording machine, problem solved."
34326,PS3,3,1665.28,1667.52,2.24,3.0,"You don't even need to invite the sign language, everybody just."
34326,PS3,3,1668.64,1669.68,1.04,2.0,What about the deaf people?
34326,PS3,3,1671.56,1672.56,1.0,2.0,"Ah, you mean a sign?"
34326,PS3,3,1674.24,1675.08,0.84,3.0,"If I, if I, if."
34326,PS3,3,1675.44,1678.48,3.04,1.0,Machine if show the sign and also.
34326,PS3,3,1678.96,1682.72,3.76,3.0,If the person who has said sorry has already been infected.
34326,PS3,3,1683.2,1686.84,3.64,3.0,"OK, I'll record you on my machine when I see you."
34326,PS3,3,1686.84,1688.12,1.28,3.0,"Yeah, I want a girl's voice."
34326,PS3,3,1688.44,1688.92,0.48,1.0,You understand?
34326,PS3,3,1691.44,1692.24,0.8,3.0,What I'm saying I want a lady.

34326,PS3,3,1695.48,1696.52,1.04,3.0,Problem self.
34326,PS3,3,1696.96,1699.72,2.76,2.0,So we designed a machine that can either spell.
34326,PS3,3,1699.88,1702.6,2.72,1.0,It and announce sorry so it show.
34326,PS3,3,1702.84,1703.92,1.08,2.0,A sign for blind.
34326,PS3,3,1703.92,1705.8,1.88,1.0,"People for blind people, No."
34326,PS3,3,1705.88,1706.44,0.56,1.0,No for deaf.
34326,PS3,3,1706.48,1707.88,1.4,2.0,People for deaf people deaf.
34326,PS3,3,1708.04,1708.6,0.56,1.0,People.
34326,PS3,3,1708.6,1710.4,1.8,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34326,PS3,3,1711.8,1713.04,1.24,3.0,I can't believe they asked this question.
34326,PS3,3,1715.4,1716.84,1.44,2.0,Just to test your creativity.
34326,PS3,3,1719.92,1721.68,1.76,1.0,Create a gadget.
34326,PS3,3,1723.2,1724.68,1.48,2.0,"No, an AI machine."
34326,PS3,3,1726.16,1727.32,1.16,1.0,Say sorry you said AI.
34326,PS3,3,1728.0,1728.12,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34326,PS3,3,1729.44,1731.24,1.8,3.0,"Actually, AI can do this very easily now."
34326,PS3,3,1731.24,1734.76,3.52,2.0,An AI machine that would detect what kind of condition in fact.
34326,PS3,3,1735.8,1737.68,1.88,3.0,I can actually record these boys.
34326,PS3,3,1738.32,1739.32,1.0,3.0,He doesn't even have to be there.
34326,PS3,3,1739.32,1740.72,1.4,3.0,I can create a new speech that.
34326,PS3,3,1740.84,1741.4,0.56,2.0,Sounds like you.
34326,PS3,3,1741.56,1742.36,0.8,2.0,That sounds like me.
34326,PS3,3,1742.76,1744.4,1.64,2.0,So that's what he does with the music.
34326,PS3,3,1745.28,1745.56,0.28,3.0,App Yeah.
34326,PS3,3,1746.2,1747.4,1.2,3.0,So you don't have to be there anymore.
34326,PS3,3,1747.4,1748.52,1.12,3.0,That's what my computer's doing.
34326,PS3,3,1748.68,1758.32,9.64,2.0,"Now, right, we already called sorry on an AI microphone or something and we use it in replacement of humans saying it."
34326,PS3,3,1758.8,1759.04,0.24,1.0,Right.
34326,PS3,3,1760.32,1761.0,0.68,1.0,I love this idea.
34326,PS3,3,1762.04,1762.8,0.76,1.0,No more saying.
34326,PS3,3,1763.04,1764.92,1.88,2.0,AI and AI is the one getting sick.
34326,PS3,3,1766.24,1766.48,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34326,PS3,3,1768.44,1770.4,1.96,2.0,Are we competing with AI now or what?
34326,PS3,3,1772.24,1775.32,3.08,2.0,It just so we want to get AI sick too.
34326,PS3,3,1775.4,1777.64,2.24,2.0,"That's so funny, Oh my God."
34326,PS3,3,1782.04,1794.84,12.8,2.0,"I tend to think that a lot of people are just trying to become AI Duma, but the reality is that in fact, we have not even accessed the true capabilities of what the system can do yet."
34326,PS3,3,1795.44,1801.0,5.56,2.0,And people start to have like strong opinion about what and the do and don't and so on and so forth.
34326,PS3,3,1801.0,1804.64,3.64,2.0,So it's quite concerning.
34326,PS3,3,1805.56,1805.76,0.2,1.0,OK.
34326,PS3,3,1805.8,1806.4,0.6,1.0,Should we proceed?
34326,PS3,3,1806.72,1807.08,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, all."
34326,PS3,3,1807.84,1809.32,1.48,1.0,Right last.
34326,PS3,3,1809.56,1810.08,0.52,2.0,Question.
34326,PS3,3,1810.24,1810.8,0.56,2.0,Lovely.
34326,PS3,3,1811.2,1812.56,1.36,2.0,I like when it's last.
35260,PS1,6,0.64,5.64,5.0,1.0,The company should also provide its crew members you know depends regardless you are.
35260,PS1,6,7.44,12.12,4.68,2.0,Plastic Place is one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime.
35260,PS1,6,12.2,13.8,1.6,2.0,Please come up with one creative.
35260,PS1,6,13.84,14.08,0.24,3.0,Idea.
35260,PS1,6,14.36,15.92,1.56,2.0,To use plastic pollution.
35260,PS1,6,18.4,25.6,7.2,1.0,We use it most of time I guess 1st and the basic solution is use paper bags and you know the plastic alternatives.
35260,PS1,6,26.16,41.36,15.2,4.0,Well think about weirdly it just say say come up with create idea to tackle to reduce plastic pollution so we can increase other pollution to reduce plastic pollution.
35260,PS1,6,42.88,43.8,0.92,3.0,How would encounter that?
35260,PS1,6,45.16,55.52,10.36,4.0,"Like just nobody just stop using plastic, things start to use like wood, wood base or and the other base like just stop using plastic."
35260,PS1,6,57.84,60.52,2.68,1.0,"We can't, you said stop using plastic."
35260,PS1,6,60.8,61.2,0.4,1.0,Did you say?
35260,PS1,6,61.32,69.16,7.84,1.0,"Yeah, I think you know, I I know it sounds weird, but in my opinion, we cannot stop using plastic."
35260,PS1,6,69.4,71.2,1.8,1.0,Plastic is like our other self.
35260,PS1,6,72.0,73.0,1.0,4.0,"Yeah, that's, that's what I'm saying."
35260,PS1,6,73.2,73.8,0.6,4.0,"Yeah, I know, I know."
35260,PS1,6,73.88,74.84,0.96,4.0,I mean like I'm doing this.
35260,PS1,6,74.92,76.4,1.48,1.0,"Everything is about plastic, yeah."
35260,PS1,6,76.52,77.76,1.24,4.0,I think it's about plastic like.
35260,PS1,6,77.84,80.8,2.96,1.0,"So everything, even your specs."
35260,PS1,6,80.8,82.76,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, my phone."
35260,PS1,6,82.8,84.28,1.48,1.0,Your phone so far so.
35260,PS1,6,85.32,86.4,1.08,1.0,So what we can do?
35260,PS1,6,86.44,95.96,9.52,1.0,"In my opinion, we can reduce the usage of plastic as much as the efficient use, as as with the case with electricity and same with plastic."
35260,PS1,6,96.24,97.16,0.92,4.0,You are saying we use it?
35260,PS1,6,97.92,98.8,0.88,1.0,We use recycle.
35260,PS1,6,98.8,103.12,4.32,1.0,"Yes, we use recycle triple R Maybe I have studied about that."
35260,PS1,6,104.64,106.52,1.88,4.0,"But like I think it, we are already doing this."
35260,PS1,6,107.36,107.84,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, we are."
35260,PS1,6,107.96,108.32,0.36,1.0,"Yes, we are."
35260,PS1,6,108.32,108.44,0.12,1.0,But.
35260,PS1,6,110.32,114.56,4.24,2.0,I think we will be doing it at varying levels in different parts of the world.
35260,PS1,6,116.4,116.6,0.2,3.0,So.
35260,PS1,6,117.16,127.44,10.28,2.0,"Maybe a uniform approach to reduce, like using one country or one setting as an example and the rest of the world following that."
35260,PS1,6,127.44,130.2,2.76,1.0,Example is it about public awareness you are talking about?
35260,PS1,6,131.68,132.96,1.28,2.0,More like policy.
35260,PS1,6,133.64,140.44,6.8,1.0,"And policy, OK, you can't, in my opinion, you can't impose people what to do and not to."
35260,PS1,6,140.68,144.96,4.28,1.0,"Like, for example, in Japan, Japan is, you know, one of the best countries."
35260,PS1,6,145.04,146.08,1.04,1.0,It is the best example.
35260,PS1,6,146.24,150.68,4.44,1.0,"But you know, on the other hand, United States, people don't care about usage of plastic."
35260,PS1,6,150.68,156.72,6.04,1.0,"They just want to even the Donald Trump, he, you know, he just don't care about pollution."
35260,PS1,6,156.76,158.88,2.12,1.0,How about Singapore?
35260,PS1,6,158.88,159.28,0.4,1.0,Singapore.
35260,PS1,6,159.28,162.76,3.48,1.0,Singapore is efficient and especially in radio.
35260,PS1,6,162.92,164.28,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, recycling and yeah."
35260,PS1,6,164.32,165.8,1.48,4.0,"They got punished for that, but."
35260,PS1,6,169.08,169.32,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35260,PS1,6,169.84,199.56,29.72,1.0,"On the other hand, there is one issue, but with single, I mean, if, let's say, if the global third country, like global S country, especially Africa, India, I open this as although I'm Indian, that they're still developing global S yeah, global S you can say global S countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, this type of country which has, you know, low budget, low physical budget and, and this type of technology or for reusing plastic everywhere."
35260,PS1,6,199.68,203.72,4.04,1.0,"And you know this stuff, it is expensive, so."
35260,PS1,6,204.44,209.2,4.76,3.0,"Can we, can we say maybe you know how like people carbon, what's it called?"
35260,PS1,6,209.44,211.8,2.36,3.0,They offset their carbon.
35260,PS1,6,212.32,222.92,10.6,3.0,Could we kind of introduce like seeing policy idea like this idea of offsetting your plastic consumption as well as a company being able to like measure how much plastic?
35260,PS1,6,222.92,223.2,0.28,1.0,You.
35260,PS1,6,223.32,224.4,1.08,1.0,"You, it is."
35260,PS1,6,224.4,224.84,0.44,1.0,It has.
35260,PS1,6,225.16,230.0,4.84,1.0,"It has, if you read it has, it's called carbon tax in European Union."
35260,PS1,6,230.04,230.6,0.56,1.0,It exists.
35260,PS1,6,231.2,238.68,7.48,1.0,"There is a cap, you know, maybe 7 million of CO2, seven million tonne of CO2."
35260,PS1,6,238.72,241.4,2.68,1.0,Any company in Europe cannot produce more than that.
35260,PS1,6,241.84,244.8,2.96,1.0,"Let's say if they produce per tonne, is there any plastic?"
35260,PS1,6,245.16,245.32,0.16,2.0,Tax.
35260,PS1,6,248.04,252.4,4.36,1.0,"Plastic tax, To be honest, I don't know about that, but."
35260,PS1,6,255.84,257.28,1.44,3.0,Or how about like state insurance?
35260,PS1,6,257.28,258.72,1.44,3.0,"Because we're looking for creative idea, right?"
35260,PS1,6,258.72,260.24,1.52,3.0,There's got to be something I thought.
35260,PS1,6,260.24,261.64,1.4,3.0,There's got to be something that's silly like.
35260,PS1,6,263.04,279.16,16.12,1.0,"We can encourage people we can we can encourage as well as other people not to avoid plastic like in Germany if you have a water bottle, a middle water bottle if you purchase from store and you know once your bottle is running you."
35260,PS1,6,279.16,280.48,1.32,4.0,"Got a reward for that, right?"
35260,PS1,6,281.44,286.96,5.52,1.0,You there are some vending machine in which if you submit your water you will get 25.
35260,PS1,6,288.76,289.0,0.24,4.0,You got.
35260,PS1,6,289.0,289.8,0.8,3.0,"Cash back, yeah."
35260,PS1,6,290.28,291.36,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, it is something like that."
35260,PS1,6,291.48,292.4,0.92,1.0,So we can encourage that.
35260,PS1,6,292.4,292.92,0.52,1.0,And how are you?
35260,PS1,6,293.48,295.24,1.76,3.0,Increasing that monetary reward.
35260,PS1,6,295.44,302.92,7.48,3.0,Like I love scuba diving and I would love it if governments like subsidized scuba diving for marine pools like Lucifer Day.
35260,PS1,6,303.08,303.68,0.6,3.0,You know what I mean?
35260,PS1,6,304.32,311.4,7.08,1.0,But it's it is only happens in develop economies like Europe or UK.
35260,PS1,6,311.4,312.2,0.8,1.0,"No, not necessarily."
35260,PS1,6,312.8,313.28,0.48,3.0,Like you could.
35260,PS1,6,314.92,315.36,0.44,1.0,It it.
35260,PS1,6,315.56,317.0,1.44,3.0,It can't be exported elsewhere.
35260,PS1,6,317.48,318.24,0.76,3.0,I don't see why I don't.
35260,PS1,6,319.52,320.0,0.48,4.0,See why I'm just?
35260,PS1,6,320.0,321.16,1.16,3.0,"Thinking of a creative idea, you."
35260,PS1,6,321.52,322.84,1.32,4.0,"Know, I don't see why that yeah."
35260,PS1,6,324.64,325.76,1.12,1.0,Let's type there I mean.
35260,PS1,6,327.24,329.32,2.08,4.0,"So what was that idea again, like the cash back?"
35260,PS1,6,329.44,334.04,4.6,3.0,"Like state, state funded like I really think that could be."
35260,PS1,6,334.92,343.08,8.16,1.0,Or we can say if we can illustrate the idea that reward the people who use plastic efficiently.
35260,PS1,6,343.48,344.36,0.88,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35260,PS1,6,344.88,345.12,0.24,3.0,Yeah.

35474,PS1,6,311.6,313.44,1.84,3.0,You mean like no anymore?
35474,PS1,6,313.56,314.2,0.64,3.0,Begin more.

35474,PS1,6,387.52,387.84,0.32,3.0,Instead.
35474,PS1,6,388.2,388.8,0.6,5.0,Of the beans.

36291,PS5,3,4.72,16.28,11.56,1.0,"This is voluntary attrition happens when an employee decides to leave the company, resulting in the reduction of value."
36291,PS5,3,16.28,17.36,1.08,1.0,Talent in the works for.
36291,PS5,3,17.36,21.4,4.04,1.0,"OK, I need to I need to look at this."
36291,PS5,3,22.56,26.12,3.56,1.0,"No, because this is since I'm from education."
36291,PS5,3,26.12,28.6,2.48,1.0,Everything sounds like an education problem to me.
36291,PS5,3,31.92,32.96,1.04,1.0,Are you from economics?
36291,PS5,3,33.24,34.84,1.6,1.0,Because it's all interconnected.
36291,PS5,3,34.84,35.48,0.64,1.0,I swear.
36291,PS5,3,35.48,36.76,1.28,1.0,It's so interconnected.
36291,PS5,3,36.76,38.12,1.36,1.0,Like the biggest.
36291,PS5,3,38.16,39.04,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, you're right."
36291,PS5,3,39.04,45.8,6.76,1.0,"Because like, the biggest problem with this is like, good teachers will leave the school because they're not being paid well."
36291,PS5,3,46.24,50.32,4.08,1.0,"And then you lose talent and you're like, oh, no, but the children could learn from you."
36291,PS5,3,50.56,52.24,1.68,1.0,But we don't have the budget for you.
36291,PS5,3,52.56,53.24,0.68,1.0,What do we do?
36291,PS5,3,55.0,56.44,1.44,2.0,Scroll economy and you become battle.
36291,PS5,3,58.0,61.04,3.04,1.0,But paying higher is not the the most creative solution.
36291,PS5,3,61.04,67.56,6.52,1.0,"It's like we know like the the, the best companies are paying people the highest so that they can retain them."
36291,PS5,3,67.56,77.2,9.64,1.0,"Like that's the logic, OK, Voluntary attrition."
36291,PS5,3,77.2,79.24,2.04,1.0,I don't even know what the concept means.
36291,PS5,3,79.88,84.2,4.32,1.0,Reducing something's strength or effectiveness through sustained attack or pressure.
36291,PS5,3,84.76,85.68,0.92,2.0,For just people leaving.
36291,PS5,3,85.68,87.04,1.36,1.0,"A company, what is attrition?"
36291,PS5,3,87.04,87.4,0.36,1.0,Simple.
36291,PS5,3,88.04,89.16,1.12,1.0,"OK, got it."
36291,PS5,3,89.52,90.56,1.04,1.0,"Yes, that's what it means."
36291,PS5,3,91.08,91.32,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS5,3,91.32,94.8,3.48,1.0,Just basically decrease in numbers or strength for like the company.
36291,PS5,3,95.8,99.44,3.64,1.0,"OK, So you have reduced talent in the company then."
36291,PS5,3,99.44,103.36,3.92,1.0,So how do we stop voluntary employee attrition?
36291,PS5,3,104.76,108.4,3.64,2.0,"Emotional, like personal bond within the company."
36291,PS5,3,108.4,110.28,1.88,2.0,I have a unique culture like that.
36291,PS5,3,110.52,113.28,2.76,1.0,"Yeah, actually a unique culture is not a unique idea."
36291,PS5,3,113.28,116.12,2.84,1.0,"But let's look, let's talk about what is unique about it."
36291,PS5,3,116.72,131.12,14.4,1.0,"I think having incentives which are like, oh, I read this very recent article about how is it Japan or I'm not sure which country, but they started doing this thing for Gen."
36291,PS5,3,131.12,133.68,2.56,1.0,Z where they start having hangover.
36291,PS5,3,134.92,142.2,7.28,1.0,Basically they're accommodating hangovers where employees can like just drink and then show up late to work by noon.
36291,PS5,3,142.84,146.64,3.8,1.0,And like they're doing that to retain the the Gen.
36291,PS5,3,146.64,148.48,1.84,1.0,Z employees.
36291,PS5,3,149.76,150.28,0.52,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS5,3,150.4,170.28,19.88,1.0,"So something like that maybe like, yeah, unique provide provision of unique incentives such as which are more lifestyle oriented, which are more lifestyle oriented."
36291,PS5,3,171.08,181.72,10.64,1.0,"Example hangover late start to your day, to your office day."
36291,PS5,3,183.44,189.12,5.68,1.0,"OK, what else?"
36291,PS5,3,189.84,197.08,7.24,1.0,Let's come up with more ideas like that having.
36291,PS5,3,197.4,207.84,10.44,1.0,So I know that this is a huge problem about even talent and like women's life cycles integrated with like just childcare and stuff.
36291,PS5,3,208.24,217.32,9.08,1.0,"So a lot of workplaces don't usually have like crashes at the workplace, but what if they were to have crashes at the workplace?"
36291,PS5,3,217.56,218.6,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36291,PS5,3,218.76,221.12,2.36,2.0,I think that fits in with like more lifestyle.
36291,PS5,3,221.4,221.88,0.48,1.0,Orientation.
36291,PS5,3,221.88,225.28,3.4,1.0,"Yeah, well, how do you spell crashes suck?"
36291,PS5,3,231.52,232.4,0.88,1.0,Crash.
36291,PS5,3,232.6,233.28,0.68,1.0,Crash.
36291,PS5,3,233.92,242.48,8.56,1.0,"Yeah, that's have crashes at workplaces."
36291,PS5,3,244.08,251.56,7.48,1.0,"Yeah, that would, that would also make it more feminist, honestly, like both both the father and the mother, whoever wants to take the kid to the office can take them."
36291,PS5,3,253.52,255.92,2.4,1.0,"Yeah, etcetera, anything."
36291,PS5,3,255.92,256.52,0.6,2.0,Else I'm.
36291,PS5,3,260.16,278.48,18.32,1.0,"Sorry, that is actually something I have seen which would actually motivate because like I know somebody who had an office where their owners would get their dogs or they would have like a cat and then bring your bring your animal child to work kind of day."
36291,PS5,3,278.48,278.92,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, seriously."
36291,PS5,3,279.44,281.64,2.2,2.0,That fewer won't maybe not be attached so.
36291,PS5,3,281.72,283.28,1.56,1.0,Important but but have.
36291,PS5,3,283.68,285.68,2.0,2.0,Colleagues maybe have attachment.
36291,PS5,3,285.68,288.96,3.28,1.0,To like have have office pets.
36291,PS5,3,289.0,289.68,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, have office pets."
36291,PS5,3,290.64,293.88,3.24,1.0,"Yeah, I think that's that's that's good for this one."
36291,PS5,3,294.92,301.44,6.52,1.0,"What else can we think about apart from this to not to, to not let our colleague leave?"
36291,PS5,3,302.84,305.32,2.48,1.0,What if your colleagues and we know one of us wants to leave?
36291,PS5,3,305.32,306.24,0.92,1.0,What are we going to do?
36291,PS5,3,309.96,310.76,0.8,1.0,That's tough.
36291,PS5,3,321.68,323.12,1.44,1.0,I think it would help to.
36291,PS5,3,325.48,328.96,3.48,2.0,Maybe think of like why people leave and try to describe it.
36291,PS5,3,329.24,348.84,19.6,1.0,"Could be the pressure like what if there we were to create like an accountability system, which is which is not hierarchical and involves like the person who's who's giving us work, but also like you can give a feedback directly and be like, my creativity is suffering."
36291,PS5,3,349.16,350.48,1.32,1.0,"Don't, don't pressurize me."
36291,PS5,3,352.6,370.8,18.2,1.0,"Oh, there should be a there should be like an anonymous or like something like a barometer in office where like if you're feeling pressured any like for example, if you're 10 employees and there is like this one barometer on the wall and you can just press the button until like show pressure is increasing."
36291,PS5,3,371.12,374.84,3.72,1.0,"And then like the management can just look at it and be like, OK, we need to calm down."
36291,PS5,3,377.0,380.2,3.2,1.0,"Yeah, except like you just keep measuring it with the parameter."
36291,PS5,3,380.2,382.6,2.4,1.0,But like of course there can be false counts but.
36291,PS5,3,383.56,387.28,3.72,2.0,I know some common give like stocks of the company to employees.
36291,PS5,3,388.44,389.76,1.32,1.0,But that's not a very creative.
36291,PS5,3,389.76,390.32,0.56,1.0,It's a boring.
36291,PS5,3,390.32,391.56,1.24,1.0,I will not look at it.
36291,PS5,3,392.64,396.92,4.28,1.0,"I think this is like, if I have to look at it at the wall and I'll be like, oh, shit."
36291,PS5,3,396.92,398.56,1.64,1.0,Like our company's under pressure.
36291,PS5,3,398.8,404.28,5.48,1.0,"Like it also creates a sense of community because now I will know, oh, the pressure is high right now."
36291,PS5,3,404.28,408.92,4.64,1.0,"So I think I might want to take care of my colleagues as well and, like, not bother them."
36291,PS5,3,409.04,410.68,1.64,1.0,"Yeah, no."
36291,PS5,3,410.88,419.32,8.44,2.0,Like maybe have a like more flexible working like you can work work whenever you want basically at least you get your work done.
36291,PS5,3,419.96,421.88,1.92,1.0,"Yeah, I think that's a popular idea now."
36291,PS5,3,421.88,426.96,5.08,1.0,Like there are so many companies which have gone hybrid and just work from home.
36291,PS5,3,427.08,433.08,6.0,1.0,"I think that that is already there, So it won't be new."
36291,PS5,3,433.4,441.04,7.64,3.0,Or both the company make more leisure activities that can strengthen the friendship or the relationship between the colleagues.
36291,PS5,3,441.36,444.08,2.72,3.0,"Yeah, if your best friend in this company, you won't."
36291,PS5,3,445.04,445.2,0.16,1.0,Want.
36291,PS5,3,445.2,445.4,0.2,3.0,To leave.
36291,PS5,3,445.4,447.12,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, actually that's true."
36291,PS5,3,448.04,450.56,2.52,1.0,So let me type that one first.
36291,PS5,3,450.56,452.84,2.28,1.0,What is it so?
36291,PS5,3,455.84,458.28,2.44,1.0,So would that mean hiring like does that?
36291,PS5,3,458.52,459.8,1.28,3.0,More leisure activities.
36291,PS5,3,460.12,464.6,4.48,2.0,Have like more more when you have your own more which activity to take.
36291,PS5,3,465.08,469.96,4.88,1.0,"Like more friendship, promotion, promoting activities."
36291,PS5,3,471.24,471.44,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36291,PS5,3,471.84,477.76,5.92,1.0,More recreational activities that promote friendships.
36291,PS5,3,477.76,480.6,2.84,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
36291,PS5,3,482.52,492.28,9.76,1.0,"That promote friendship, which can decrease voluntary attrition."
36291,PS5,3,497.72,498.76,1.04,1.0,OK.
36291,PS5,3,500.2,503.2,3.0,1.0,And should I add the barometer idea?
36291,PS5,3,505.28,506.12,0.84,1.0,I like that one.
36291,PS5,3,507.6,545.52,37.92,1.0,"I mean, it's it's a fun way to like just look at pressure, have a wall, have a have an office pressure barometer on the wall in the common space, which measures and indicates how much I'm just."
36291,PS5,3,546.28,547.84,1.56,2.0,Imagine this one that invested.
36291,PS5,3,547.84,551.48,3.64,1.0,"That company which measures and indicates how, how."
36291,PS5,3,551.48,555.68,4.2,1.0,"No, no, no, that's fine."
36291,PS5,3,556.0,557.96,1.96,1.0,How stressful the environment is.
36291,PS5,3,562.92,594.0,31.08,1.0,Environment is and feeds no and and becomes feedback to support colleagues and promote care culture and reduce pressure from the bosses.
36291,PS5,3,596.52,598.2,1.68,1.0,I don't know if that makes sense.
36291,PS5,3,598.2,599.0,0.8,1.0,Does that makes sense?
36291,PS5,3,599.0,599.04,0.04,1.0,Oh.
36291,PS5,3,600.84,602.6,1.76,2.0,There's a typo care culture.
36291,PS5,3,603.56,604.36,0.8,1.0,"Oh yeah, it's car."
36291,PS5,3,605.4,605.96,0.56,1.0,Car culture.
36291,PS5,3,606.48,607.24,0.76,1.0,Give us a car.
36291,PS5,3,607.36,607.84,0.48,1.0,Thank you.
36291,PS5,3,611.24,611.92,0.68,1.0,What else?
36291,PS5,3,612.72,615.28,2.56,2.0,We got like one minute or something that shall we just?
36291,PS5,3,615.28,615.44,0.16,1.0,Pick.
36291,PS5,3,615.44,617.0,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, let's just finalize."
36291,PS5,3,617.8,620.16,2.36,1.0,I like the first one quite honestly.
36291,PS5,3,620.16,622.04,1.88,1.0,Like you can get so creative with that one.
36291,PS5,3,622.08,624.36,2.28,2.0,"I like the first one, but it seems a bit general."
36291,PS5,3,624.56,625.44,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, it does."
36291,PS5,3,625.96,628.28,2.32,2.0,"I like the third one, but it seems not that useful."
36291,PS5,3,628.76,629.12,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS5,3,629.36,638.12,8.76,1.0,"Like it's more I think we should eliminate something from idea 3, which is like, let's not, let's not focus on the pressure."
36291,PS5,3,638.36,642.16,3.8,1.0,Let's focus on how can you keep the barometer low.
36291,PS5,3,644.88,645.48,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS5,3,646.56,656.44,9.88,1.0,"No, like if you have that indication monitoring, but but it's like communal monitoring because you're not really monitoring because you are the one pressing the barometer."
36291,PS5,3,656.44,657.0,0.56,2.0,"OK, right."
36291,PS5,3,658.32,663.32,5.0,1.0,"And you are the one looking at it and going like OK, we need to calm down South."
36291,PS5,3,663.68,665.64,1.96,1.0,Creating accountability with the Barometer.
36291,PS5,3,666.76,703.6,36.84,1.0,"Final idea, creating accountability with self reported pressure levels of colleagues in the office using the barometer and reducing reducing negative office culture."
36291,PS5,3,706.2,708.12,1.92,1.0,Negative office culture.
36291,PS5,3,708.8,712.16,3.36,1.0,"OK, cool."
36291,PS5,3,712.64,717.08,4.44,1.0,"Wow, this was none of them, but it combined all of them, Yeah."
35323,PS4,3,4.16,17.48,13.32,1.0,This is very different kind of question illegal distribution of resources.
35323,PS4,3,28.95,34.44,5.49,2.0,"I think the first one, we can put some online open platform so everyone can access it."
35323,PS4,3,34.64,44.24,9.6,2.0,"So no matter, they're in a good educational quality, but everyone can still access it."
35323,PS4,3,47.52,59.88,12.36,1.0,"I think also like providing more and at least like in the context of where I went to school, there's a lot of people who like pay for private counsellors or private tutors or something."
35323,PS4,3,59.88,67.16,7.28,1.0,So maybe having those as like freely available takes away the advantage of being able to pay.
35323,PS4,3,69.48,76.36,6.88,1.0,"Like, yeah, we had at my high school, we had like 4 college counselors for like 800 students."
35323,PS4,3,77.08,80.56,3.48,1.0,"And then obviously if you get one just for like a private one, it's a lot better."
35323,PS4,3,81.8,88.84,7.04,1.0,But I guess making the like baseline access a lot higher would reduce inequality.
35323,PS4,3,134.66,134.78,0.12,2.0,None.
35323,PS4,3,143.24,144.68,1.44,1.0,This is such a big problem.
35323,PS4,3,146.96,147.76,0.8,2.0,It's happening.
35323,PS4,3,148.24,148.8,0.56,1.0,Yeah.
35323,PS4,3,153.6,167.48,13.88,2.0,"Yeah, I think you can add to encourage the policy makers to to make policy or the distribution of the knowledge resources."
35323,PS4,3,169.32,189.58,20.26,1.0,To do you feel good you want to add anything else?
35323,PS4,3,216.1,218.54,2.44,1.0,I'm really curious what the AI is going to say for this.
35323,PS4,3,220.5,222.58,2.08,1.0,I'm afraid it might be much better.
35323,PS4,3,225.26,230.74,5.48,3.0,I'm thinking like for this higher level public schools open more sites at other places around the world.
35323,PS4,3,231.3,238.66,7.36,3.0,"Like like I know like Nottingham University, they have two sites in like East Region and I feel like."
35323,PS4,3,238.66,238.94,0.28,1.0,That.
35323,PS4,3,239.38,240.62,1.24,3.0,Helps to solve this problem.
35323,PS4,3,242.28,242.84,0.56,1.0,So.
35323,PS4,3,244.64,246.48,1.84,3.0,Like to open more sites internationally?
35323,PS4,3,248.28,257.8,9.52,1.0,"Expansion of, I don't know, high performing academic institutions to more international sites."
35323,PS4,3,257.84,258.12,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35323,PS4,3,258.16,258.28,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35323,PS4,3,261.24,261.32,0.08,2.0,All.
35323,PS4,3,266.16,266.92,0.76,3.0,"Right, let's go."
34498,PS1,3,0.0,621.44,2.96,1.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime.
34498,PS1,3,621.88,625.52,3.64,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic pollution.
34498,PS1,3,626.44,628.04,1.6,2.0,Rename plastic to something else.
34498,PS1,3,628.92,629.24,0.32,3.0,Rename.
34498,PS1,3,633.2,635.72,2.52,1.0,"I mean, OK, creative idea."
34498,PS1,3,635.8,637.16,1.36,1.0,What's a creative idea?
34498,PS1,3,638.12,638.84,0.72,2.0,Go to space.
34498,PS1,3,638.84,641.32,2.48,2.0,We found a meteor rod which has got bacteria on it.
34498,PS1,3,641.52,643.8,2.28,2.0,"Bring that back because that bacteria, we've seen enough."
34498,PS1,3,643.84,646.32,2.48,1.0,"Are you doing that enough, alien?"
34498,PS1,3,646.32,649.76,3.44,2.0,"Movies, and they'll probably use this as some sort of like fuel to live."
34498,PS1,3,650.6,651.52,0.92,1.0,What if?
34498,PS1,3,653.32,654.84,1.52,1.0,"Well, that is creative, I'll give you that."
34498,PS1,3,661.0,671.24,10.24,1.0,"Everyone in society gets like one good bag, one good like food container, one good coffee cup and then they get discounts everywhere."
34498,PS1,3,671.32,672.4,1.08,1.0,I guess that's not that creative.
34498,PS1,3,672.4,674.04,1.64,2.0,"They're kind of doing that right now, yeah."
34498,PS1,3,674.04,675.24,1.2,3.0,"They're doing it right now, yeah."
34498,PS1,3,676.88,678.8,1.92,2.0,Something absolutely outlandish.
34498,PS1,3,678.8,679.04,0.24,2.0,"Yeah, you're."
34498,PS1,3,679.04,680.68,1.64,1.0,Crazy outlandish.
34498,PS1,3,680.68,681.56,0.88,1.0,That's pretty good.
34498,PS1,3,685.76,690.84,5.08,3.0,"Maybe we can just say like if you if you use plastic, you go to jail."
34498,PS1,3,691.36,694.4,3.04,1.0,Why do we keep going back on punitive approaches?
34498,PS1,3,695.56,699.6,4.04,3.0,"When yeah, I mean, that's really effective."
34498,PS1,3,699.68,700.88,1.2,3.0,Punitive is very active.
34498,PS1,3,701.88,703.08,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, fear mongering."
34498,PS1,3,703.16,703.64,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
34498,PS1,3,703.64,709.16,5.52,1.0,What if we what if we did a combination of going to space and getting plastic eating bacteria?
34498,PS1,3,709.68,720.16,10.48,1.0,"And also we come up with like, like Katy Perry, but anti plastic, like a crazy pop star who's just like all of her songs are singing against plastic and she's like dressed it won't."
34498,PS1,3,720.16,720.64,0.48,3.0,Work.
34498,PS1,3,720.84,721.28,0.44,3.0,"Yeah, it."
34498,PS1,3,721.36,722.8,1.44,2.0,Doesn't matter if there's no.
34498,PS1,3,723.48,725.2,1.72,1.0,What if it's like a Sabrina Carpenter?
34498,PS1,3,725.2,733.4,8.2,1.0,Like please please please no plastic tonight guys make.
34498,PS1,3,733.4,736.32,2.92,3.0,"It I, I, I, I think we should go punitive."
34498,PS1,3,736.68,736.96,0.28,1.0,OK.
34498,PS1,3,737.32,741.0,3.68,3.0,"Just like if you use plastic, it's almost like you use drugs."
34498,PS1,3,741.64,742.2,0.56,2.0,So if we if.
34498,PS1,3,742.2,743.8,1.6,1.0,You think chatty BT will go in the?
34498,PS1,3,744.08,744.8,0.72,3.0,I don't think so.
34498,PS1,3,744.88,745.04,0.16,3.0,So.
34498,PS1,3,745.08,752.24,7.16,2.0,"If we if we work under the assumption that there's, you know, infinite number of universes that we haven't yet."
34498,PS1,3,752.24,753.32,1.08,1.0,Discovered OK.
34498,PS1,3,754.2,755.2,1.0,2.0,It's fairly plausible.
34498,PS1,3,755.2,762.96,7.76,2.0,I think somewhere in that universe there's going to be somewhere where there's a Harry Potter universe and people have spells and stuff.
34498,PS1,3,762.96,777.12,14.16,2.0,"So surely we could just find that, you know, wherever that is, ask them to come here, and then just, you know, use a spell to change plastic into humanoid things that can then go and recycle themselves."
34498,PS1,3,777.2,779.0,1.8,1.0,"Oh wow, sentience."
34498,PS1,3,779.16,779.8,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34498,PS1,3,779.92,780.72,0.8,2.0,"I mean, they may take."
34498,PS1,3,780.72,782.6,1.88,1.0,I I think that's the most creative.
34498,PS1,3,782.6,783.24,0.64,1.0,So do we.
34498,PS1,3,783.96,784.4,0.44,3.0,We have to.
34498,PS1,3,784.88,787.28,2.4,3.0,We can just be creative without say.
34498,PS1,3,787.52,789.12,1.6,2.0,It doesn't need to make any sense.
34498,PS1,3,789.36,790.16,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, I think so."
34498,PS1,3,790.76,791.28,0.52,1.0,That's pretty.
34498,PS1,3,791.44,793.0,1.56,2.0,"Good, it's a chance it does."
34498,PS1,3,793.08,794.12,1.04,2.0,It could exist.
34498,PS1,3,794.4,795.16,0.76,3.0,"It could, yeah."
34498,PS1,3,795.2,795.32,0.12,3.0,It's.
34498,PS1,3,795.8,796.8,1.0,2.0,A very slim chance.
34498,PS1,3,796.84,799.4,2.56,1.0,"OK, so how do we phrase this?"
34498,PS1,3,801.32,805.28,3.96,3.0,So we create spells to remove plastic.
34498,PS1,3,808.56,809.48,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, that's not bad."
34498,PS1,3,809.48,811.36,1.88,1.0,"Drawing upon, I think would be better."
34498,PS1,3,816.44,821.68,5.24,2.0,It is plausible that there exists a world out there in which spells exist.
34498,PS1,3,821.96,822.56,0.6,3.0,Work.
34498,PS1,3,839.04,840.0,0.96,1.0,We'll make this science.
34498,PS1,3,846.44,859.8,13.36,2.0,"Now, well, therefore what we should do is basically take the entire world's monetary supply, give it to NASA so that they can start sending space missions to the world while we all starve."
34498,PS1,3,859.8,864.28,4.48,2.0,"We will find, we'll find this world and then bring them back."
34498,PS1,3,864.28,867.32,3.04,2.0,"And what humans are left, we'll be able to."
34498,PS1,3,883.96,885.08,1.12,3.0,"Oh, there's a word count."
34498,PS1,3,885.48,886.36,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, I just realized."
34498,PS1,3,886.52,891.64,5.12,2.0,That I was just counting up and down.
34498,PS1,3,892.16,896.32,4.16,2.0,Oh Warlock.
34498,PS1,3,897.16,898.2,1.04,2.0,What is What is a Warlock?
34498,PS1,3,898.6,901.72,3.12,1.0,"I'm an alien warlock, a male witch."
34498,PS1,3,902.96,903.48,0.52,1.0,"Oh, OK."
34498,PS1,3,905.52,905.8,0.28,2.0,Is it?
34498,PS1,3,906.16,906.44,0.28,2.0,"Yeah, I."
34498,PS1,3,906.44,907.88,1.44,1.0,Didn't know that witch and warlock I.
34498,PS1,3,908.6,908.76,0.16,2.0,Don't.
34498,PS1,3,909.08,911.28,2.2,1.0,Know that guys gotta read more?

34498,PS1,3,986.12,987.76,1.64,3.0,How do what?
34498,PS1,3,987.92,990.72,2.8,1.0,Can't because it'll take itself to the recycling facility.

34498,PS1,3,992.4,995.24,2.84,2.0,And then just put in after that.
34498,PS1,3,996.56,1003.08,6.52,3.0,Why don't we just ask this warlock to just make all plastic pollution disappears?
34498,PS1,3,1003.08,1003.36,0.28,3.0,We're still.
34498,PS1,3,1003.36,1004.4,1.04,2.0,Going to need the plastic we'll.

34498,PS1,3,1008.24,1008.76,0.52,1.0,Because then.
34498,PS1,3,1008.84,1010.16,1.32,1.0,But what if you create more?
34498,PS1,3,1010.44,1011.68,1.24,3.0,"Yes, ask them to."
34498,PS1,3,1012.28,1012.6,0.32,2.0,Just do.

34498,PS1,3,1019.56,1024.32,4.76,2.0,"You know, enslaved him and it's just they're going casting spells in plastic you."
34498,PS1,3,1024.32,1025.04,0.72,3.0,Should do that.
34498,PS1,3,1025.56,1027.44,1.88,3.0,"Yeah, that's not recycle."
34498,PS1,3,1027.44,1028.6,1.16,1.0,OK to give.
34498,PS1,3,1028.8,1029.8,1.0,1.0,So no sentience.
34498,PS1,3,1029.8,1031.44,1.64,1.0,The plastics don't get sentience.
34498,PS1,3,1031.64,1034.88,3.24,3.0,"No, just to to get to make the plastic disappear."
34498,PS1,3,1035.84,1037.12,1.28,1.0,But if it disappears.
34498,PS1,3,1037.32,1038.96,1.64,2.0,Then we'll forever have no plastic.
34498,PS1,3,1038.96,1039.72,0.76,3.0,Position disappear.
34498,PS1,3,1039.72,1044.44,4.72,1.0,"Yeah, but let's say you have like a plastic bowl and then he weighs his wand and then your soup is just on the ground."
34498,PS1,3,1045.24,1046.56,1.32,3.0,After the after you use it.
34498,PS1,3,1046.56,1047.24,0.68,1.0,"OK, Yeah."
34498,PS1,3,1048.12,1049.36,1.24,2.0,To how many times can you use it?
34498,PS1,3,1049.4,1050.04,0.64,2.0,Only once.
34498,PS1,3,1050.24,1053.24,3.0,3.0,"Yeah, once that's OK, it's going to increase the consumption."
34498,PS1,3,1053.48,1053.96,0.48,2.0,You're right.
34498,PS1,3,1053.96,1055.4,1.44,2.0,You're right helping the world economy.
34498,PS1,3,1055.4,1056.48,1.08,3.0,Recover exactly.
34498,PS1,3,1056.52,1058.48,1.96,2.0,That we've now spent on this space mission.
34498,PS1,3,1059.08,1059.92,0.84,3.0,I mean how?
34498,PS1,3,1060.68,1062.08,1.4,2.0,Because we have to produce more plastic.
34498,PS1,3,1063.24,1065.52,2.28,3.0,Because we just need to reduce the plastic pollution.
34498,PS1,3,1066.6,1068.68,2.08,3.0,We don't have to reduce the use of plastic.
34498,PS1,3,1077.44,1079.56,2.12,3.0,"Yeah, economy growth."
34498,PS1,3,1092.48,1097.2,4.72,1.0,That's pretty creative for drawing upon the theory of the multiverse.
34498,PS1,3,1097.2,1101.68,4.48,1.0,It is plausible that a world exists wherein Harry Potter style spells are efficacious.
34498,PS1,3,1101.68,1107.08,5.4,1.0,"Thus, we will leverage the global monetary supply to launch a research program to find this magical universe."
34498,PS1,3,1107.08,1114.88,7.8,1.0,"Send a delegation to that planet, bring back an alien warlock witch to the earth and have him her cast a spell to make all plastics disappear after use."
34498,PS1,3,1114.92,1115.76,0.84,2.0,After a single use.
34498,PS1,3,1116.0,1125.24,9.24,1.0,"After a single use, this will mean that more plastic production is required, boosting the global economy after the economic ravages of our space quests."
34498,PS1,3,1125.56,1127.08,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, circular, circular."
34498,PS1,3,1129.32,1129.88,0.56,1.0,Next.
34498,PS1,3,1131.44,1132.32,0.88,3.0,"This is pretty nice, yeah."
34498,PS1,3,1132.56,1133.8,1.24,2.0,This is pretty nice.
34498,PS1,3,1134.4,1134.56,0.16,1.0,Really.
34498,PS1,3,1135.0,1136.28,1.28,1.0,"Taking them on a tail, Yeah."
34498,PS1,3,1137.12,1138.48,1.36,2.0,Everyone's questioning me more.
34498,PS1,3,1139.28,1140.88,1.6,2.0,"I'm thinking like, where did you come up with these guys?"
34498,PS1,3,1141.6,1142.32,0.72,1.0,"OK, ready."
34498,PS1,3,1142.96,1143.08,0.12,1.0,OK.
34785,PS6,6,15.28,17.04,1.76,1.0,So the one creative idea to interview.
34785,PS6,6,19.4,19.92,0.52,2.0,That's interesting.
34785,PS6,6,19.92,20.44,0.52,2.0,I like this.
34785,PS6,6,21.96,22.16,0.2,2.0,OK.
34785,PS6,6,23.72,27.92,4.2,1.0,"So I guess one thing is how do you incentivize someone to do this, right?"
34785,PS6,6,28.56,30.12,1.56,2.0,Can you put a monetary incentive?
34785,PS6,6,30.92,31.2,0.28,3.0,No.
34785,PS6,6,32.12,33.64,1.52,2.0,Monetary is bad source of all evil.
34785,PS6,6,34.2,35.96,1.76,4.0,"No, no, it has limited outcomes."
34785,PS6,6,36.12,37.32,1.2,3.0,Like people do it to a point.
34785,PS6,6,37.36,38.48,1.12,5.0,"To do it to a point, yeah."
34785,PS6,6,38.68,45.04,6.36,5.0,What if your the the water current or the water heat would depend on your singing.
34785,PS6,6,45.12,47.0,1.88,5.0,"So if you don't sing, it gets really cold."
34785,PS6,6,47.16,51.16,4.0,5.0,You get really cold water in winter and somewhere you get really hot.
34785,PS6,6,51.8,53.92,2.12,5.0,Forced to sing to get the other way.
34785,PS6,6,54.92,60.36,5.44,4.0,"Until people get just used to getting burnt or actually frozen, it's just like this is the way of life now."
34785,PS6,6,61.4,69.96,8.56,2.0,"I think it's hard when you put like a metric, especially metric, you know, like that because similar to what you said, as soon as you create a metric, it ceases to be a good metric for what's designed to measure or people will exploit it."
34785,PS6,6,69.96,74.0,4.04,2.0,"If we someone in your case, it might be someone who will come in and be like, you know, making one tone."
34785,PS6,6,74.68,76.44,1.76,2.0,"Does it still reap the benefits, you know?"
34785,PS6,6,78.36,87.4,9.04,1.0,Maybe we can have like 20 minutes playlist on Spotify of the best songs like to be sung in the shower and then you just.
34785,PS6,6,87.4,89.32,1.92,5.0,What if not everyone likes the same songs?
34785,PS6,6,89.32,91.6,2.28,5.0,"Then you have to select your own Spotify pages, right?"
34785,PS6,6,91.88,94.08,2.2,1.0,I mean the Spotify the AI would give you.
34785,PS6,6,94.24,95.12,0.88,5.0,"Oh, based on your based."
34785,PS6,6,95.36,114.0,18.64,1.0,"On your maybe, and then they would be like, and then they would be like, oh, we have a new feature like get your own Shava playlist and then if it will pop up, maybe some people would enter be like, oh, let's see like something I mean, I'm not sure yeah, it does not require money or anything, but it would be like, oh, let's see what."
34785,PS6,6,114.6,115.0,0.4,3.0,What happens?
34785,PS6,6,115.32,116.64,1.32,3.0,You could play into this part of.
34785,PS6,6,116.64,122.8,6.16,4.0,"People being like, OK, I guarantee you, we can play you songs for 20 minutes and you will sing to one of them."
34785,PS6,6,122.8,131.24,8.44,4.0,"And so people will then kind of see it as a competition to try and listen to, and then potentially they'll probably sing along with one or two and then you'll be like, hah, got you."
34785,PS6,6,132.28,144.28,12.0,5.0,Maybe also introduce karaoke shower setup or like you so like you can sell those like tell that this is a new setup that we are like like it's student accommodation.
34785,PS6,6,144.28,145.28,1.0,5.0,One thing is you carry.
34785,PS6,6,145.4,145.8,0.4,5.0,OK yeah.
34785,PS6,6,145.84,152.32,6.48,5.0,And maybe make it cheaper so that people are more encouraged to buy those than the regular ones something.
34785,PS6,6,153.52,154.44,0.92,3.0,You're spreading.
34785,PS6,6,154.44,155.68,1.24,6.0,False information about.
34785,PS6,6,155.68,156.04,0.36,2.0,I thought.
34785,PS6,6,156.04,157.32,1.28,3.0,"About that, yeah, in the shower."
34785,PS6,6,157.68,158.08,0.4,6.0,Forcing.
34785,PS6,6,159.52,160.72,1.2,2.0,Giving you cancer in 20 years.
34785,PS6,6,161.44,161.8,0.36,2.0,Fear.
34785,PS6,6,161.8,163.2,1.4,2.0,Use fear as the motivating factor.
34785,PS6,6,163.2,164.6,1.4,5.0,"As in, if you don't sing, you get."
34785,PS6,6,164.6,164.96,0.36,2.0,Cancer.
34785,PS6,6,165.08,165.28,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
34785,PS6,6,165.8,166.32,0.52,2.0,Fake news.
34785,PS6,6,166.32,166.92,0.6,2.0,Inject fake news.
34785,PS6,6,166.92,168.28,1.36,2.0,Because it doesn't have to be ethical.
34785,PS6,6,168.28,173.68,5.4,2.0,"You know, that's an interesting idea, but."
34785,PS6,6,174.28,174.8,0.52,5.0,Even guys.
34785,PS6,6,175.4,176.08,0.68,1.0,So that's what they did.
34785,PS6,6,176.08,178.76,2.68,1.0,So that's what they did for World War 2.
34785,PS6,6,179.04,187.52,8.48,1.0,"Like the British figured out radars and then the people were like, how how did the planes know how they can fly so well in the dark?"
34785,PS6,6,187.68,191.16,3.48,1.0,"And the British people and the British government said, oh, it's because we all eat carrots."
34785,PS6,6,191.16,191.56,0.4,1.0,Carrots.
34785,PS6,6,191.8,193.12,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, really good in the dark."
34785,PS6,6,193.12,197.12,4.0,1.0,"Actually, they were just spreading propaganda and nobody would know they discovered radars."
34785,PS6,6,197.16,197.32,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
34785,PS6,6,199.36,200.84,1.48,1.0,"OK, let's we just have."
34785,PS6,6,200.88,201.6,0.72,5.0,To one idea.
34785,PS6,6,202.4,202.48,0.08,1.0,So.
34785,PS6,6,203.04,206.12,3.08,2.0,What about viral marketing people?
34785,PS6,6,206.28,208.24,1.96,2.0,"You know how powerful it is with the power of TikTok, right?"
34785,PS6,6,208.48,210.16,1.68,2.0,People were eating Tide pods at one point.
34785,PS6,6,210.76,213.56,2.8,2.0,"People were doing, that's so true, eating cinnamon, right?"
34785,PS6,6,213.56,219.08,5.52,2.0,"So that is the power that social media could give to a malicious actor, right?"
34785,PS6,6,219.16,220.88,1.72,2.0,"But we're doing it for for the good reasons, right?"
34785,PS6,6,221.12,224.0,2.88,2.0,"And one way would be to do like a challenge, right?"
34785,PS6,6,224.0,225.12,1.12,2.0,Sing in the shower challenge.
34785,PS6,6,225.16,226.68,1.52,5.0,Cold ice ice puppy.
34785,PS6,6,226.72,228.16,1.44,2.0,Channels similar to that exactly.
34785,PS6,6,228.16,229.24,1.08,5.0,Sing in the shower challenge.
34785,PS6,6,231.12,231.48,0.36,2.0,Exactly.
34785,PS6,6,232.24,232.6,0.36,5.0,But then.
34785,PS6,6,232.84,233.84,1.0,6.0,But that's short lived.
34785,PS6,6,234.64,234.96,0.32,2.0,That's.
34785,PS6,6,235.12,239.2,4.08,4.0,"True, it doesn't say that it has to be a long lived, it just says come up with a way."
34785,PS6,6,240.32,240.6,0.28,5.0,Let's do.
34785,PS6,6,240.6,241.4,0.8,5.0,"OK, wait, wait a minute."
34785,PS6,6,241.4,241.68,0.28,5.0,So.
34785,PS6,6,241.68,245.28,3.6,1.0,Like this I mean I can see it happening with all the celebrities doing it.
34785,PS6,6,245.48,248.92,3.44,1.0,It would create like some trash momentum like some.
34785,PS6,6,249.2,251.2,2.0,5.0,And then you tell them that it's actually really good for.
34785,PS6,6,251.2,252.4,1.2,2.0,Health and they're already locked in and.
34785,PS6,6,252.4,253.6,1.2,5.0,"They're already locked in, yeah."
34785,PS6,6,253.88,258.8,4.92,4.0,So why don't you get the presidents of every single nation in the world to do this?
34785,PS6,6,258.8,264.68,5.88,4.0,"As an example of this is how we are making change, which then encourages everyone else to kind of do it."
34785,PS6,6,264.68,267.4,2.72,4.0,And then you have a leadership board worldwide.
34785,PS6,6,267.4,267.8,0.4,3.0,Which?
34785,PS6,6,268.08,274.72,6.64,4.0,"Ranks people and just on voice I'm seeing like yeah, it gets into your whistles."

35200,PS4,3,83.32,87.2,3.88,2.0,"But yeah, yeah."
35200,PS4,3,88.64,95.52,6.88,1.0,Because I I I have a Africa friend and he told me he got the full scholarship from the government.
35200,PS4,3,95.52,97.12,1.6,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, actually."
35200,PS4,3,97.16,97.44,0.28,2.0,OK.

35200,PS4,3,169.08,172.4,3.32,2.0,"OK, so I don't really understand the question."
35200,PS4,3,172.52,174.56,2.04,2.0,Can you explain the question?
35200,PS4,3,175.6,183.76,8.16,1.0,I can't wait for it educationally in quality is unequal distribution for the resources.
35200,PS4,3,183.96,188.44,4.48,1.0,"Oh, for example, like this is the city A, this is the city B."
35200,PS4,3,188.52,191.88,3.36,1.0,"You can see the city B is more stronger, more higher."
35200,PS4,3,192.12,203.8,11.68,1.0,"I mean, they have the many, many good resources, for example, like Oxford, Cambridge, but like the poorer, like weight area is they do not have any good resources."
35200,PS4,3,204.64,209.32,4.68,1.0,So it means they have the long distance and the distribution.
35200,PS4,3,209.36,211.64,2.28,1.0,It means that is the good one.
35200,PS4,3,211.64,231.36,19.72,1.0,"So that's the low 1, the inequality, the unbalanced that is the education we call because like because for example, like the way develop area compared to developing and they're kind of different."
35200,PS4,3,232.0,232.36,0.36,1.0,They're more.
35200,PS4,3,232.36,234.04,1.68,2.0,Rich what?
35200,PS4,3,234.04,237.72,3.68,1.0,"We have to do with it, I think the other way."
35200,PS4,3,237.76,242.76,5.0,1.0,"We can ask the server part to help us, for example, like the government."
35200,PS4,3,243.56,244.24,0.68,2.0,So the government.
35200,PS4,3,244.24,246.48,2.24,1.0,Found maybe a good way to do that.
35200,PS4,3,247.8,250.12,2.32,1.0,Or is it encouraged to encourage?
35200,PS4,3,253.6,255.88,2.28,1.0,"Yeah, supported dictionary and found."
35200,PS4,3,255.96,256.36,0.4,2.0,By.
35200,PS4,3,259.04,260.28,1.24,1.0,"Yeah, by the government funding."
35200,PS4,3,270.96,278.0,7.04,1.0,"I think online, online platform is one of very like low courses with low cost."
35200,PS4,3,278.24,281.12,2.88,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, normal you don't have to put that down."
35200,PS4,3,281.48,281.68,0.2,1.0,OK.
35200,PS4,3,283.52,284.36,0.84,1.0,Is there any way?
35200,PS4,3,290.56,291.32,0.76,2.0,Oh so.

35200,PS4,3,297.0,298.16,1.16,1.0,The second way is you.
35200,PS4,3,298.24,302.52,4.28,1.0,You're going to send in a teacher from from the higher?
35200,PS4,3,302.56,303.84,1.28,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35200,PS4,3,303.84,305.44,1.6,1.0,We can also send the students.
35200,PS4,3,305.44,315.08,9.64,1.0,Students from from rural areas also fund by the government because the government funding is also the for the tax.
35200,PS4,3,315.36,315.6,0.24,2.0,Yes.
35200,PS4,3,316.0,323.64,7.64,1.0,Actions and the tension is everyone the income tax and growth tax because it's mostly.
35200,PS4,3,324.44,325.84,1.4,2.0,The government that can.
35200,PS4,3,326.12,328.28,2.16,1.0,Everyone have to pay for the tax.
35200,PS4,3,335.68,347.04,11.36,1.0,"To know they, they, they do have, I remember because some of the students from their housing is a poor city, right?"
35200,PS4,3,347.08,358.2,11.12,1.0,"I mean, compared to the large, large city and the student, they do not have the chance to go to the large city even for the childhood I mean."
35200,PS4,3,359.32,362.44,3.12,2.0,They should like have like the excursion program.
35200,PS4,3,362.52,363.04,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35200,PS4,3,363.48,364.56,1.08,2.0,Excursion like.

35200,PS4,3,388.89,404.76,15.87,2.0,Or maybe like this school can actually like the headmaster or whatever can actually be be partnered with this.
35200,PS4,3,405.72,408.92,3.2,2.0,You can have this partner or this that OK.
35200,PS4,3,412.6,414.48,1.88,1.0,"Oh, I see you got good idea."
35200,PS4,3,414.68,428.04,13.36,1.0,"I think like like some of this like teacher in from the poorest city, they can go to the largest city and and to learn something knowledge and after maybe three or two years, they just go back to the college."
35200,PS4,3,428.52,434.44,5.92,1.0,"Yeah, go, go back to their cities and just reward to their student, transfer to this student."
35200,PS4,3,437.48,443.48,6.0,1.0,"Yeah, but some to be honest, like some of it's Asia, they leave from the courses, they don't go back."
35200,PS4,3,443.64,445.48,1.84,2.0,They have a contract they will have to do like.
35200,PS4,3,445.6,446.44,0.84,1.0,That because.

35200,PS4,3,449.52,454.28,4.76,2.0,So it's just like you going for a job and you have like a fixed term contract.
35200,PS4,3,454.6,468.48,13.88,2.0,"So you've been transferred to another, another country or another company just to get the ideas and get the listing and be transferred back to your country to get to, you know, that's a."

34813,PS3,3,370.48,373.96,3.48,3.0,They're not being a good please come up with 1 clear idea to reduce the spread.
34813,PS3,3,374.68,376.8,2.12,3.0,That's that's that is a creative question I have to admit is.
34813,PS3,3,380.12,381.4,1.28,1.0,There a way to make everyone mute?
34813,PS3,3,383.52,385.48,1.96,2.0,"Yeah, I suppose we can just cut everyone's tongues off."
34813,PS3,3,385.48,389.96,4.48,2.0,That's very achievable.
34813,PS3,3,389.96,391.6,1.64,2.0,I don't know how people will enjoy it.
34813,PS3,3,393.08,393.84,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, I kind of like that."

34813,PS3,3,401.64,401.68,0.04,3.0,A.
34813,PS3,3,401.92,403.96,2.04,2.0,Creative way to reduce its spread.
34813,PS3,3,403.96,405.84,1.88,1.0,Cut off all English because.
34813,PS3,3,408.0,411.12,3.12,2.0,"I'm in like a good portion of the world, but I mean, yeah, who needs them?"
34813,PS3,3,411.88,420.36,8.48,1.0,Terrible people did.
34813,PS3,3,420.36,426.04,5.68,2.0,"Everyone say it in one instant, then it can't spread anymore after that."
34813,PS3,3,427.16,431.08,3.92,2.0,"But let's both doesn't really help the point of a town, which is to reduce its spread."
34813,PS3,3,431.48,432.52,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, that's true."
34813,PS3,3,432.52,432.8,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
34813,PS3,3,436.32,440.24,3.92,3.0,"Because I guess this almost implies that you, it's not clear, like, how long."
34813,PS3,3,440.68,445.12,4.44,3.0,"Like if you have a time horizon that you know, you wait maybe two weeks after everyone says sorry."
34813,PS3,3,445.12,446.6,1.48,3.0,Then after that the pandemic dies off.
34813,PS3,3,447.36,450.16,2.8,3.0,People go back to seeing sources like a temporary measure maybe.
34813,PS3,3,451.0,453.52,2.52,2.0,"If someone says the word sorry, you put them in prison."
34813,PS3,3,455.08,458.72,3.64,3.0,"You chop off their tongues like that's, that's the, that's the penalty."
34813,PS3,3,458.72,463.48,4.76,3.0,"Like, you know, when people would steal back in, in the day, they'd chop off your hands, you know, but that's your tongue."
34813,PS3,3,463.48,465.36,1.88,3.0,"And that's if you say sorry, that's."
34813,PS3,3,466.08,466.56,0.48,2.0,Pretty good.
34813,PS3,3,468.8,472.92,4.12,2.0,"Remove the word Sorry from all documentation worldwide, you can't even type it in."
34813,PS3,3,472.92,473.48,0.56,2.0,You can't.
34813,PS3,3,474.2,475.44,1.24,2.0,It's not a dictionary.
34813,PS3,3,476.4,483.6,7.2,3.0,"The only thing with that is that people that might sort of like trigger discussions about that, like, oh, did you hear they removed the word sorry and not insane."
34813,PS3,3,483.6,489.68,6.08,3.0,"It was just coughing, you know, it's almost like a policy."
34813,PS3,3,489.68,492.52,2.84,3.0,"You need that sort of fast acting policy, you know."
34813,PS3,3,495.44,496.76,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, I mean, Fiat does that pretty quick."
34813,PS3,3,496.76,497.36,0.6,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34813,PS3,3,509.12,511.8,2.68,3.0,"Yeah, I kind of think a few tactic is probably best in this case."
34813,PS3,3,512.52,512.84,0.32,2.0,"OK, so."
34813,PS3,3,512.96,524.36,11.4,3.0,"Let's say I sort of like that idea with the punishment, because the punishment approach is probably realistic, practical, right?"
34813,PS3,3,524.36,525.4,1.04,3.0,It's probably going to do its job.
34813,PS3,3,525.8,531.16,5.36,3.0,"But then you could sort of demonstrate creativity by choosing A suitable punishment, right?"
34813,PS3,3,535.56,536.4,0.84,3.0,So what would that?
34813,PS3,3,537.04,537.12,0.08,1.0,Be.
34813,PS3,3,538.72,544.08,5.36,3.0,"Like chopping someones up the car off or for the punishment, like punishing some of the same story."
34813,PS3,3,544.84,546.32,1.48,3.0,"That part is probably obvious, yeah."
34813,PS3,3,546.6,550.84,4.24,3.0,"But I think it's like, what do you do in terms of the criminalization, right?"
34813,PS3,3,551.68,554.44,2.76,2.0,The two big toes removed so that the car will happen anymore.
34813,PS3,3,565.08,565.8,0.72,1.0,While you execute.
34813,PS3,3,571.12,572.6,1.48,2.0,"OK, well then we cut off the It's a funny."
34813,PS3,3,572.92,600.0,27.08,3.0,"It's a funny sort of, I mean, there's something to be said about like kind of what you said earlier about like everyone's saying sorry at the same time, if everyone is infected, how's it going to spread?"
34813,PS3,3,600.12,602.2,2.08,3.0,"Yeah, I think that's a nice."
34813,PS3,3,602.2,604.28,2.08,3.0,That's a nice angle of attack.
34813,PS3,3,610.64,610.84,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
34813,PS3,3,610.84,615.84,5.0,3.0,"You have to really like strike the fear, you know every even thinking about it already, you know, is a risk."
34813,PS3,3,620.08,620.6,0.52,2.0,That's pretty good.
35764,PS5,6,28.67,31.91,3.24,1.0,"OK, the ideas."
35764,PS5,6,33.87,47.24,13.37,2.0,"Other employees cut their hours, go part time, so they protect that one person and everyone keeps the talent that they have specifically got How?"
35764,PS5,6,50.04,51.32,1.28,3.0,Many people would be willing to do that.
35764,PS5,6,52.36,55.04,2.68,2.0,"Sometimes people are just looking, my experience."
35764,PS5,6,55.04,60.88,5.84,2.0,Sometimes people are just looking for a reason to cut hours and it might be it might work.
35764,PS5,6,66.4,70.72,4.32,1.0,"So sorry, what was the so how do we how do we go about it?"
35764,PS5,6,70.72,75.64,4.92,1.0,"So we're saying every for every person that leaves the company, we would cut the hours of the."
35764,PS5,6,75.64,75.92,0.28,2.0,Others.
35764,PS5,6,75.96,76.12,0.16,2.0,No.
35764,PS5,6,76.12,82.28,6.16,2.0,This one is just saying come up with one creative idea to stop people losing.
35764,PS5,6,84.72,87.84,3.12,2.0,"Yeah, just we, we."
35764,PS5,6,87.96,90.68,2.72,2.0,"You'd have to do it for each specific case, wouldn't you?"
35764,PS5,6,92.68,92.84,0.16,1.0,Right.
35764,PS5,6,99.93,106.17,6.24,2.0,"OK, some sort of bonus for staying in the company a certain amount of time, so if someone doesn't decide to leave."
35764,PS5,6,108.45,110.69,2.24,4.0,Pay rise.
35764,PS5,6,110.73,111.41,0.68,5.0,"Yeah, but like what?"
35764,PS5,6,111.41,112.01,0.6,2.0,What are?
35764,PS5,6,112.09,114.45,2.36,5.0,What are the actual reasons that people are deciding to leave?
35764,PS5,6,114.49,119.53,5.04,5.0,"Is it because, you know, maybe like, for one thing, the salary, the salary package isn't competitive enough?"
35764,PS5,6,120.45,122.97,2.52,5.0,"Is there like, you know, dynamic issues with ventures?"
35764,PS5,6,124.44,126.2,1.76,5.0,Is it like a toxic work environment?
35764,PS5,6,126.64,133.32,6.68,5.0,I guess like the first steps might be to try to locate the the the various causes of people's decision to leave.
35764,PS5,6,133.72,138.28,4.56,1.0,"And that's a that's the logical way of approaching, But we're asked to provide a creative that."
35764,PS5,6,138.72,140.64,1.92,5.0,Doesn't mean that you have to be irrational to be creative.
35764,PS5,6,142.08,146.76,4.68,1.0,"No, but I I like the idea of that time accumulation."
35764,PS5,6,147.08,149.2,2.12,1.0,"The longer you stay, the more incentive you get."
35764,PS5,6,149.68,153.36,3.68,1.0,So that is just like a simple exponential calculation.
35764,PS5,6,153.64,153.96,0.32,5.0,It doesn't.
35764,PS5,6,154.44,157.6,3.16,2.0,"Matter, and that doesn't necessarily involve monetary gain."
35764,PS5,6,157.6,161.88,4.28,2.0,It could be if you're there for five years you get an extra 2 days off or something.
35764,PS5,6,176.12,189.52,13.4,4.0,"Before they enter the company, whatever they are doing, just say it's confidential asking to sign a confidential agreement and they will not be able to find another job of a similar kind after for example, but that's common carrot."
35764,PS5,6,189.96,192.8,2.84,2.0,And carrot and stick it's not.
35764,PS5,6,192.8,194.76,1.96,4.0,Going anywhere it's irrational or not.
35764,PS5,6,196.76,197.12,0.36,5.0,It's illegal.
35764,PS5,6,197.44,200.08,2.64,5.0,"Well, I mean, I'm not sure about Pierre, but in this statement it would have been."
35764,PS5,6,200.16,201.36,1.2,5.0,So in some states it would have been.
35764,PS5,6,201.56,203.88,2.32,4.0,"Yeah, I mean, it's already happening, so it's not creative."
35764,PS5,6,207.52,221.72,14.2,3.0,"Maybe you could think about when you're hiring the talent in the 1st place to try and come up with ways, a creative way, I guess, but in some ways to try and make sure that the people you're hiring where that are actually the right fit."
35764,PS5,6,222.0,226.48,4.48,3.0,"And I'll just come in and say, because there's a lovely bonus in five years and then they'll take it and leave."
35764,PS5,6,228.48,232.4,3.92,3.0,"So, you know, trying to something about the culture of the work trying to."
35764,PS5,6,233.24,233.44,0.2,6.0,Yeah.
35764,PS5,6,234.96,238.36,3.4,6.0,I'm also thinking about can we like modify the payment scheme?
35764,PS5,6,238.36,244.04,5.68,6.0,Like make some percentage of the payment to be kept by the company and normally if.
35764,PS5,6,245.12,245.84,0.72,4.0,"The company, yeah."
35764,PS5,6,245.88,246.76,0.88,6.0,That's the pension.
35764,PS5,6,247.08,249.2,2.12,6.0,"If they leave the company, they lose their pension."
35764,PS5,6,249.56,253.36,3.8,6.0,"If they stay in the company until the retirement, they get the full pension."
35764,PS5,6,254.2,254.96,0.76,6.0,That kind of thing.
35764,PS5,6,257.28,259.04,1.76,4.0,"That's also done in practice, but."
35764,PS5,6,259.88,260.12,0.24,6.0,Yeah.
35764,PS5,6,261.24,261.96,0.72,4.0,"OK, so."
35764,PS5,6,262.08,264.0,1.92,6.0,What happens to the pension when they leave?
35764,PS5,6,264.76,265.44,0.68,4.0,I don't remember.
35764,PS5,6,265.52,269.44,3.92,4.0,So I was actually offered a job when I was graduating as an undergraduate.
35764,PS5,6,269.44,280.52,11.08,4.0,"So they, they told me that after, if I serve eight years, so some part of my, yeah, some part of my salary go to another like a fund and after, if I serve eight years, I'll get 100% of them."
35764,PS5,6,280.88,284.72,3.84,4.0,"But if I left early, I'll only get like, say 25% or 50% twenty."
35764,PS5,6,284.72,285.44,0.72,6.0,5% on.
35764,PS5,6,285.68,288.56,2.88,4.0,"Yeah, but not all my salary, but just part of my salary."
35764,PS5,6,288.56,288.96,0.4,4.0,How?
35764,PS5,6,289.0,289.36,0.36,4.0,How?
35764,PS5,6,289.44,289.88,0.44,6.0,How how?

35764,PS5,6,290.2,290.96,0.76,6.0,What's the percentage?
35764,PS5,6,291.8,294.2,2.4,4.0,It's like 20% of my salary goes to the.
35764,PS5,6,294.2,296.72,2.52,3.0,# and influence or decision as to whether to take the job.
35764,PS5,6,296.84,297.36,0.52,6.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35764,PS5,6,297.36,298.88,1.52,4.0,"I'm talking this, yeah."
35764,PS5,6,298.88,302.64,3.76,4.0,"So of course, of course I didn't take it because I wouldn't, I didn't want to serve a company."
35764,PS5,6,302.96,303.16,0.2,4.0,So OK.
35764,PS5,6,305.0,305.12,0.12,6.0,Yeah.
35764,PS5,6,305.12,311.04,5.92,6.0,"But but if you really enter the company, do you think that thing will like keep you in the company?"
35764,PS5,6,311.04,311.32,0.28,6.0,Yeah.
35764,PS5,6,311.36,320.44,9.08,4.0,"That will but there are lots of other I mean to be creative then we might think of some unusual ways I mean so for example, so."
35764,PS5,6,320.56,328.04,7.48,5.0,"That in different teams and they do like everyone on the team States and like everyone gets so like kind of like comfort, comfort mentalized."
35764,PS5,6,328.6,329.52,0.92,6.0,"Yeah, I think that's."
35764,PS5,6,329.52,333.68,4.16,5.0,"And so obviously some of the people will be like they're putting it in the efforts in, in terms of yeah."
35764,PS5,6,333.84,335.36,1.52,1.0,"Yeah, it's a loyalty competition, yeah."
35764,PS5,6,335.68,336.12,0.44,6.0,"Yeah, no."

35764,PS5,6,341.88,342.48,0.6,1.0,Idea of a.
35764,PS5,6,344.04,345.72,1.68,4.0,Competition if everyone.
35764,PS5,6,345.72,345.96,0.24,1.0,In their.
35764,PS5,6,345.96,347.24,1.28,4.0,Team stands they.

35764,PS5,6,353.12,354.2,1.08,1.0,"No, I think the court is long enough."
35764,PS5,6,354.96,355.32,0.36,5.0,"OK, Yeah."
35764,PS5,6,356.36,362.08,5.72,4.0,"So to be creative, if I were the boss, I would create a company school, company accommodation company, everything."
35764,PS5,6,362.6,368.0,5.4,4.0,"So once an employee comes here, they will leave in a company accommodation and their children go to a company school."
35764,PS5,6,368.0,368.28,0.28,4.0,You know you.
35764,PS5,6,368.32,368.44,0.12,5.0,Should.

35764,PS5,6,378.44,379.72,1.28,4.0,This is you're actually never creative.
35764,PS5,6,380.56,381.36,0.8,1.0,That's not creative.
35764,PS5,6,381.36,381.52,0.16,1.0,That's.
35764,PS5,6,382.88,383.88,1.0,4.0,"What they're doing, Yeah."
35764,PS5,6,384.6,384.96,0.36,1.0,Apple Park.

35764,PS5,6,391.48,392.28,0.8,1.0,With this company.
35764,PS5,6,392.52,397.48,4.96,5.0,Editions very team members team.
35764,PS5,6,399.12,402.36,3.24,4.0,Just make the companies present for every single team in their life.
35764,PS5,6,402.36,404.16,1.8,4.0,"You should watch it, but yet."
35764,PS5,6,408.68,410.76,2.08,1.0,"The loyalty competition, that'd be pretty good."
35764,PS5,6,410.88,414.76,3.88,1.0,It's like a battle Royale for you're loyalty to the company for.
35764,PS5,6,414.8,420.96,6.16,3.0,"Staying in the company, if you were to get offered say $20,000 pounds a year more."
35764,PS5,6,422.08,422.32,0.24,4.0,You know.
35764,PS5,6,423.36,425.76,2.4,3.0,The with the team loyalty like keep you loud.
35764,PS5,6,426.52,427.96,1.44,3.0,"So guys, I'm off."
35764,PS5,6,427.96,429.12,1.16,3.0,I'm going to go get paid more.
35764,PS5,6,433.08,437.12,4.04,4.0,So some companies also issue stock shares if they are on the market.
35764,PS5,6,437.32,443.04,5.72,4.0,"So they they offer stock shares, but they, the employee can't sell them after, for example, eight years."
35764,PS5,6,443.68,447.76,4.08,4.0,"And then if they leave the company, those stock shares will just be given back to the company."
35764,PS5,6,448.04,448.68,0.64,4.0,That's what people are.
35764,PS5,6,448.76,449.08,0.32,1.0,Doing.
35764,PS5,6,449.68,451.2,1.52,4.0,But that's not great if it's already done.
35764,PS5,6,454.84,459.0,4.16,1.0,"But no, I I like what?"
35764,PS5,6,459.48,469.6,10.12,1.0,"I'm sorry if I didn't say what she was saying about like, yeah, because in a way you're, you're part of a team that's not like endangered to sign a contract."
35764,PS5,6,469.64,472.88,3.24,1.0,We're actually working with your fellow colleagues.
35764,PS5,6,474.56,474.68,0.12,4.0,And.
35764,PS5,6,474.68,476.44,1.76,6.0,Everyone will just become nicer to.
35764,PS5,6,477.52,477.6,0.08,1.0,You.
35764,PS5,6,486.12,488.48,2.36,5.0,"People with activities, well, it."
35764,PS5,6,488.84,496.4,7.56,2.0,"Could be accurate or it could be bonuses like access to health, extra health benefits."
35764,PS5,6,496.4,496.68,0.28,2.0,It's.
35764,PS5,6,500.8,502.56,1.76,3.0,"Probably make clear that it's, you know?"
35764,PS5,6,502.92,503.88,0.96,5.0,"Yeah, I feel like a team."
35764,PS5,6,505.32,506.76,1.44,3.0,"No, all members of the team stay."
35764,PS5,6,512.72,516.52,3.8,5.0,"Yeah, and."
35764,PS5,6,516.52,517.76,1.24,2.0,The team has to say.
35764,PS5,6,531.56,531.68,0.12,4.0,None.
35764,PS5,6,558.96,559.96,1.0,5.0,You want to change the wording?
35764,PS5,6,561.4,562.68,1.28,4.0,In the team on the.
35764,PS5,6,563.36,563.96,0.6,5.0,Team sorry 2nd.
35764,PS5,6,564.44,564.88,0.44,4.0,Last time.
35764,PS5,6,565.96,567.4,1.44,5.0,"On in the team, which is finally."
35764,PS5,6,577.57,578.61,1.04,4.0,I'm happy to move on to your.
35764,PS5,6,579.17,579.37,0.2,5.0,Next.
35764,PS5,6,579.77,580.05,0.28,1.0,Question.
35764,PS5,6,580.09,581.69,1.6,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
35764,PS5,6,582.81,584.85,2.04,5.0,Let me just read over one last time.
35932,PS3,6,6.48,11.12,4.64,1.0,"OK, that's great."
35932,PS3,6,11.12,15.56,4.44,1.0,This is giving like Harry Potter like the word that you can't pronounce.
35932,PS3,6,22.72,35.64,12.92,1.0,"OK, I have a thought like how about just change the education system and teach all the children like from very young age to act straightforward, not be apologetic and just be like direct."
35932,PS3,6,35.68,39.12,3.44,1.0,"You know, a lot of companies have this kind of culture like you."
35932,PS3,6,39.16,43.72,4.56,1.0,"You either you either like super competitive culture, you either survive or you leave."
35932,PS3,6,44.44,49.16,4.72,1.0,"So maybe maybe by doing that changing education, they will stop saying that word."
35932,PS3,6,49.92,50.52,0.6,1.0,That's a good thing.
35932,PS3,6,50.56,53.8,3.24,1.0,But then I think the word might be a little what if?
35932,PS3,6,56.2,58.08,1.88,2.0,We change the word yeah as.
35932,PS3,6,58.48,58.52,0.04,3.0,A.
35932,PS3,6,59.56,62.72,3.16,3.0,"Yeah, replace it with something else, but then."
35932,PS3,6,63.44,65.04,1.6,2.0,Older generations will still use it though.
35932,PS3,6,65.56,66.28,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, that's right."
35932,PS3,6,66.6,69.44,2.84,1.0,What about the the people who are already affected by it?
35932,PS3,6,70.04,71.96,1.92,1.0,I think it would like try and make the world.
35932,PS3,6,71.96,73.04,1.08,1.0,I think that the most.
35932,PS3,6,73.4,86.28,12.88,1.0,"I mean, psychology speaking, you probably have more insight into that, but I think that's kind of making that word have a like a bad association in people's brain with like if they associate that that word with like actually something conditioning."
35932,PS3,6,86.44,86.8,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,86.84,89.12,2.28,1.0,And so conditioning kind of the condition.
35932,PS3,6,89.32,91.92,2.6,1.0,"I don't know how, but like, do you think that that's where is really bad?"
35932,PS3,6,91.92,98.64,6.72,1.0,"And so they don't see it and they don't feel like, because I feel like just banning the word might make people actually want."
35932,PS3,6,98.64,107.12,8.48,1.0,"Yeah, more the whole I go, I'm seeing maybe like, what is it called Pavel's conditioning?"
35932,PS3,6,107.12,117.68,10.56,1.0,"Like you condition the world with radioactivity or with something really dark, something really horrible, and then you constantly advertise it to the public."
35932,PS3,6,117.88,119.68,1.8,1.0,So gradually they will stop using it.
35932,PS3,6,119.68,126.12,6.44,1.0,"They will associate the word with fear or with with disgust, and then they will stop using."
35932,PS3,6,127.44,130.64,3.2,1.0,"Yeah, I mean, that would be the most effective way I can."
35932,PS3,6,130.68,131.56,0.88,1.0,And it can be good.
35932,PS3,6,131.56,134.2,2.64,1.0,"But then, I don't know, hearing me think you can make it."
35932,PS3,6,134.2,139.28,5.08,1.0,This is kind of like maybe not the most regressive way to to implement.
35932,PS3,6,140.52,141.88,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, but it's already emerged."
35932,PS3,6,141.88,146.2,4.32,1.0,"So the advertising or the education, they might take long."
35932,PS3,6,146.2,149.8,3.6,1.0,So what should we do now to stop the the spread?
35932,PS3,6,150.24,154.8,4.56,4.0,"Maybe something more compulsory, because if you are compulsory advertising it you."
35932,PS3,6,154.8,155.24,0.44,1.0,Still have.
35932,PS3,6,155.24,157.52,2.28,4.0,To express the word so it's.
35932,PS3,6,157.68,158.08,0.4,1.0,Actually.
35932,PS3,6,161.48,164.6,3.12,1.0,But who will monitor if you say that word privately at home?
35932,PS3,6,164.92,166.64,1.72,1.0,Who will stop you from?
35932,PS3,6,168.84,171.44,2.6,5.0,"That's not easy because sorry, is used thousands of times a."
35932,PS3,6,171.52,171.8,0.28,1.0,"Day, OH."
35932,PS3,6,172.0,172.12,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,172.64,173.48,0.84,1.0,This is hard.
35932,PS3,6,179.44,184.6,5.16,1.0,Or just invent a new way of breathing things.
35932,PS3,6,185.04,189.68,4.64,1.0,"And so people, when they read the word sorry, we actually start pronouncing things differently."
35932,PS3,6,189.68,191.12,1.44,1.0,And so it kind of changed.
35932,PS3,6,191.36,203.36,12.0,1.0,"And so when you're really sorry, I know you say like, so T instead of sorry, or that's the idea in the new English language is going to be pronounced T, and you just have to get used to it."
35932,PS3,6,203.36,204.72,1.36,1.0,And then people get educated.
35932,PS3,6,204.72,207.0,2.28,1.0,"But at first, like, we kind of force people to."
35932,PS3,6,207.68,207.92,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,208.36,210.08,1.72,4.0,"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea."
35932,PS3,6,210.08,212.92,2.84,4.0,You can change the pronunciation like indirectly.
35932,PS3,6,212.92,216.2,3.28,4.0,"For example, if you change the pronunciation of the."
35932,PS3,6,216.32,217.48,1.16,3.0,Letter O or.
35932,PS3,6,218.16,218.28,0.12,1.0,Y.
35932,PS3,6,218.68,227.6,8.92,4.0,Then you simultaneously change people how how people say sorry and also all the related words without like even referring to the word sorry itself.
35932,PS3,6,227.96,230.24,2.28,1.0,"Yeah, they'll be in so very good."
35932,PS3,6,230.6,230.96,0.36,2.0,You can't.
35932,PS3,6,231.04,233.28,2.24,2.0,You only have to change like 2 letters around.
35932,PS3,6,233.52,238.2,4.68,1.0,"As well Yeah and I mean if people want to pronounce it, they just like no one is going to understand them."
35932,PS3,6,238.2,241.08,2.88,1.0,"So there is like any point in like actually pronouncing it, sorry."
35932,PS3,6,241.52,245.4,3.88,1.0,"So people would just like, yeah, most more likely to just like not say."
35932,PS3,6,246.04,246.12,0.08,4.0,It.
35932,PS3,6,247.2,251.24,4.04,6.0,But there's only one concern that some people just say it unconsciously.
35932,PS3,6,251.24,251.88,0.64,6.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35932,PS3,6,252.0,252.28,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,253.96,254.04,0.08,4.0,They.
35932,PS3,6,254.04,254.32,0.28,1.0,Didn't.
35932,PS3,6,254.52,255.28,0.76,6.0,Notice they're saying.
35932,PS3,6,255.56,258.6,3.04,1.0,"Sorry, sorry I."
35932,PS3,6,259.48,261.24,1.76,6.0,Haven't found any idea to solve this.
35932,PS3,6,262.36,264.52,2.16,1.0,I would say it's like a step kind of program.
35932,PS3,6,264.52,274.76,10.24,1.0,"It's like if it's immediate in the first time, the word could be banned, but then try implement at the same time measures that are going to like make it easier for people to actually switch in the long run."
35932,PS3,6,274.76,290.96,16.2,1.0,"Whether it's like school education, starting to pronounce it differently, kind of educating people on the fact that they shouldn't pronounce it and the reason why like, but in the first time, I think that like just kind of banning the world would be a good thing so we don't have a new pandemic."
35932,PS3,6,295.68,302.36,6.68,4.0,So the solution could be at the really beginning we ban the word itself and then we like we change the like.
35932,PS3,6,302.36,308.04,5.68,4.0,"For example, we change the pronunciation of certain letters to prevent it from the longer term."
35932,PS3,6,308.64,309.36,0.72,2.0,Should write that on.
35932,PS3,6,309.84,310.4,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35932,PS3,6,313.0,313.32,0.32,2.0,So.
35932,PS3,6,313.32,315.04,1.72,3.0,"At first the word should be banned, right?"
35932,PS3,6,317.28,320.52,3.24,1.0,"And like, maybe like place fines for people who say it."
35932,PS3,6,320.64,329.48,8.84,1.0,"Like you can report anyone who says it And then yeah, I have to pay like, I don't know, some money like they were the 1 getting sick."
35932,PS3,6,329.48,340.68,11.2,1.0,"So I mean, because if it's transmitted by saying the word sorry, I don't know whether it's like the person who has it who transmits it to someone else by saying sorry in this case, it's like pretty bad."
35932,PS3,6,340.68,352.0,11.32,1.0,"Or if you're the one who's catching it when you say sorry, in that sense, it's like, I mean, you're getting kind of finished yourself by anything, then getting there."
35932,PS3,6,352.44,361.6,9.16,1.0,"So it's like, yeah, so."
35932,PS3,6,362.28,363.84,1.56,3.0,Put a little breathing in the word.
35932,PS3,6,365.56,367.0,1.44,5.0,Pronounce it something different.
35932,PS3,6,367.6,367.84,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,369.84,376.52,6.68,1.0,Like use gestures later on find another pronunciation or find gestures to replace the word like emoji.
35932,PS3,6,377.92,380.0,2.08,1.0,Anything else aside from the word itself.
35932,PS3,6,380.84,382.28,1.44,1.0,Just maybe gestures is good.
35932,PS3,6,386.4,390.72,4.32,1.0,I would also like try and use media to bring awareness to the people in the first time.
35932,PS3,6,390.76,404.28,13.52,1.0,So like use both at the same time like awareness and then also like finishing method like reporting and actually.
35932,PS3,6,404.28,410.92,6.64,4.0,How do we like how do we warn people through media without saying the word sorry so say the.
35932,PS3,6,412.36,412.56,0.2,1.0,Word.
35932,PS3,6,412.56,413.76,1.2,1.0,"Sorry, but you can write it."
35932,PS3,6,414.08,414.36,0.28,1.0,Oh yeah.
35932,PS3,6,416.52,416.84,0.32,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35932,PS3,6,417.68,419.48,1.8,1.0,And because it's like transmission of the disease.
35932,PS3,6,419.48,423.08,3.6,1.0,"I mean, if someone is saying it in the in the police war, they're filming."
35932,PS3,6,423.08,424.16,1.08,4.0,Saying it.
35932,PS3,6,424.56,426.4,1.84,1.0,So we can actually like.
35932,PS3,6,426.88,427.96,1.08,4.0,"Ban, Yeah."
35932,PS3,6,427.96,428.28,0.32,1.0,There is.
35932,PS3,6,428.52,429.44,0.92,1.0,"There are some, yeah."
35932,PS3,6,432.24,441.0,8.76,5.0,"Even if the strict actions are taken, those are saying sorry, very much strict actions that people will be aware that they should not say just because."
35932,PS3,6,441.48,442.4,0.92,1.0,Something or hard.
35932,PS3,6,442.56,443.12,0.56,4.0,Fine.
35932,PS3,6,443.12,443.8,0.68,1.0,Or something.
35932,PS3,6,443.8,444.16,0.36,1.0,And yeah.
35932,PS3,6,445.4,448.32,2.92,5.0,So consciously they will try to avoid that word.
35932,PS3,6,448.32,448.8,0.48,5.0,Sorry.
35932,PS3,6,449.12,449.4,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,449.96,452.96,3.0,4.0,"Oh, and also maybe erase or replace."
35932,PS3,6,453.2,453.92,0.72,1.0,The sorry.
35932,PS3,6,454.08,459.4,5.32,4.0,Word used before like older movies were like media recordings.
35932,PS3,6,460.12,460.52,0.4,1.0,Oh yeah.
35932,PS3,6,462.2,469.44,7.24,3.0,"Yeah, how?"
35932,PS3,6,469.44,497.44,28.0,1.0,"Do you spell subconsciously subconscious CIO and actually coming from that like kind of a mix of both on social media, kind of like using advocates that are trying to like if we create a new word or a new pronunciation, kind of like strong people with messages that are saying that other word And so even in this subconscious."
35932,PS3,6,497.44,498.28,0.84,3.0,They're going to like.
35932,PS3,6,498.76,501.08,2.32,1.0,Immediately think of the other new words.
35932,PS3,6,501.6,506.56,4.96,1.0,"And so even when you say sorry, like without thinking about it, it's going to be unconsciously coming."
35932,PS3,6,506.68,506.8,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,506.88,511.0,4.12,1.0,"Yeah, I think that's it."
35932,PS3,6,513.2,513.36,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS3,6,518.04,519.24,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, I think."
35932,PS3,6,519.68,520.6,0.92,3.0,"It's good, that good, yeah."
36143,PS5,3,0.32,1.92,1.6,1.0,I've got 12 minutes for this one.
36143,PS5,3,3.4,8.12,4.72,1.0,"Have this employee decide to leave the company resulting in reduction value, talent and workforce."
36143,PS5,3,8.12,12.44,4.32,1.0,Book on with some credit to start voluntary employee attrition.
36143,PS5,3,13.84,14.0,0.16,2.0,Oh gosh.
36143,PS5,3,14.36,14.64,0.28,2.0,OK.
36143,PS5,3,16.56,18.08,1.52,3.0,Do we need to take notes for this?
36143,PS5,3,18.36,19.08,0.72,2.0,I don't think so.
36143,PS5,3,19.56,23.08,3.52,2.0,We come up with a thing and then I guess you write it down.
36143,PS5,3,23.24,25.56,2.32,2.0,So we have to come with one solution.
36143,PS5,3,25.64,25.8,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
36143,PS5,3,25.84,25.96,0.12,1.0,OK.
36143,PS5,3,26.08,26.8,0.72,1.0,We can move it through that.
36143,PS5,3,29.48,36.76,7.28,2.0,"OK, So what could be a reason people decided to leave the company?"
36143,PS5,3,37.32,38.6,1.28,1.0,I guess the salary.
36143,PS5,3,38.76,40.4,1.64,2.0,The salary I think is a big one.
36143,PS5,3,40.48,45.8,5.32,1.0,And and consistent study they we're going to compare with AI and we're going to come up with a more creative.
36143,PS5,3,46.08,46.84,0.76,2.0,Creative idea.
36143,PS5,3,47.16,47.48,0.32,1.0,So.
36143,PS5,3,47.88,49.72,1.84,2.0,"We're going to take out the box, yeah."
36143,PS5,3,49.88,51.0,1.12,1.0,So just just write it down.
36143,PS5,3,51.4,57.8,6.4,2.0,"I guess like is thinking like out-of-the-box, like there might be one that's just boring but good."
36143,PS5,3,58.68,62.28,3.6,2.0,"Yeah, So think."
36143,PS5,3,62.32,64.2,1.88,3.0,Of the chances of promotion.
36143,PS5,3,65.4,66.6,1.2,2.0,"That's a good one, yeah."
36143,PS5,3,66.6,68.56,1.96,2.0,If they feel like it's just sort of a dead end job.
36143,PS5,3,68.6,70.8,2.2,1.0,Chance of the promo.
36143,PS5,3,70.84,70.96,0.12,3.0,So.
36143,PS5,3,71.08,89.72,18.64,2.0,"These are like the reasons I guess we've got to come up with like the oh, like some structure or policy to stop people from leaving as much stop voluntary."
36143,PS5,3,90.64,92.12,1.48,2.0,You could stop them.
36143,PS5,3,93.84,98.56,4.72,1.0,"So what we have right now is increased salary chance, chance of the promotion, yeah."
36143,PS5,3,98.68,99.0,0.32,2.0,"Yeah, once."
36143,PS5,3,100.32,101.08,0.76,1.0,You go on 10 minutes.
36143,PS5,3,106.12,114.2,8.08,2.0,I guess you should keep an eye on what other it your competition in like the local area I guess.
36143,PS5,3,114.48,114.8,0.32,1.0,Keep eyes.
36143,PS5,3,114.84,119.28,4.44,2.0,"So when you're thinking about increasing the salary, you're trying to benchmark it to other."
36143,PS5,3,122.56,123.24,0.68,1.0,Keep us on what?
36143,PS5,3,124.08,129.08,5.0,2.0,On keep your eye on like what other employee employers are offering.
36143,PS5,3,129.64,129.72,0.08,3.0,You.
36143,PS5,3,130.44,131.52,1.08,1.0,Mean OK.
36143,PS5,3,132.64,141.64,9.0,2.0,"Just this is if we were to increase, so I guess also increasing benefits in other cases."
36143,PS5,3,145.68,149.28,3.6,2.0,"I think it needs to be contextual, like yeah."
36143,PS5,3,150.24,151.48,1.24,1.0,How about building welfare?
36143,PS5,3,152.04,152.32,0.28,2.0,Sorry.
36143,PS5,3,152.76,154.8,2.04,1.0,Building better welfare system.
36143,PS5,3,154.84,159.16,4.32,2.0,"Yeah, I guess that's like if we were the government, we should try and do that."
36143,PS5,3,159.16,166.6,7.44,2.0,"It might be a bit hard for a company, but yeah, like healthcare or the healthcare insurance."
36143,PS5,3,170.04,173.24,3.2,2.0,"Childcare is another big one, though."
36143,PS5,3,173.24,173.72,0.48,2.0,It's hard to go.
36143,PS5,3,173.72,178.92,5.2,2.0,"It's like creative this, but it's like these are all like quite basic."
36143,PS5,3,180.88,182.72,1.84,3.0,I think the working environment is also.
36143,PS5,3,182.72,183.08,0.36,2.0,Important.
36143,PS5,3,183.64,186.16,2.52,3.0,"Oh yeah, how you get along with your."
36143,PS5,3,186.92,188.52,1.6,2.0,"That's the basic one, yeah."

36143,PS5,3,194.32,194.64,0.32,1.0,Should I?
36143,PS5,3,194.64,195.08,0.44,1.0,"It's a, it's a."
36143,PS5,3,195.16,195.84,0.68,1.0,It's a control.
36143,PS5,3,196.16,196.32,0.16,2.0,Z.
36143,PS5,3,196.72,198.84,2.12,1.0,"Control Z No, it doesn't work."
36143,PS5,3,199.92,200.44,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, today."
36143,PS5,3,203.04,206.24,3.2,1.0,"OK, a chance of promotion, building a healthcare."
36143,PS5,3,207.16,210.6,3.44,3.0,Other in compare with other employees.
36143,PS5,3,210.8,211.28,0.48,2.0,That was it.
36143,PS5,3,221.5,222.1,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36143,PS5,3,222.1,222.66,0.56,1.0,What's it say?
36143,PS5,3,222.82,223.98,1.16,1.0,The environment maybe?
36143,PS5,3,224.34,239.08,14.74,2.0,"One thing we should just in general do that would cover all of these just to serve employees and ask them what they want because like, you know, like employees might be kind."
36143,PS5,3,239.4,240.04,0.64,3.0,To their.
36143,PS5,3,240.36,242.04,1.68,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, Adapt to their needs."
36143,PS5,3,242.04,258.24,16.2,2.0,"Yeah, because and I suppose, like you could say, oh, increasing the salary, that's really expensive for the company or the benefits, but it's going to be much more expensive to hire a new person who doesn't understand and has to learn the company."
36143,PS5,3,258.48,261.08,2.6,2.0,You have to wait months and months to find the right person.
36143,PS5,3,264.68,264.88,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36143,PS5,3,265.56,266.28,0.72,1.0,So what should I write down?
36143,PS5,3,268.28,268.84,0.56,2.0,Perhaps.
36143,PS5,3,269.28,275.96,6.68,2.0,"Yeah, survey employees to find out their needs, their needs."
36143,PS5,3,275.96,277.8,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, I don't know how you do that."
36143,PS5,3,277.8,278.96,1.16,1.0,Sorry about.
36143,PS5,3,279.12,281.44,2.32,2.0,"That I'm feeling like I don't, yeah."
36143,PS5,3,282.04,283.8,1.76,1.0,How about employee certification?
36143,PS5,3,284.12,284.36,0.24,1.0,OK.
36143,PS5,3,284.36,285.52,1.16,1.0,The needs for employee is it?

36143,PS5,3,285.88,298.12,12.24,3.0,"Because we have personal needs like if I cannot raise my salary, maybe I want more prevention like like like like substitute for my commute fees."
36143,PS5,3,298.48,306.16,7.68,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, I guess all of these require spending money on the part of the company."
36143,PS5,3,306.2,308.08,1.88,2.0,I don't really know how.
36143,PS5,3,308.48,322.44,13.96,2.0,"I guess one thing is if it's a culture problem within the company, like maybe there's a boss who's really awful, maybe an anonymous survey could be good so people feel, you know, that they can."
36143,PS5,3,322.44,338.2,15.76,2.0,"And then at least if it was so to do with that, they felt like, oh, I'm leaving even though the salary's good, but because my boss is all full, then like that, at least you could there's a way you can deal with that that doesn't involve, that doesn't require other the factories."
36143,PS5,3,339.92,342.4,2.48,2.0,How do we how do we build this stand into one thing?
36143,PS5,3,342.88,344.0,1.12,1.0,"OK, just write it down."
36143,PS5,3,344.52,346.84,2.32,2.0,"Because like, they're safe to come up with one create."
36143,PS5,3,347.08,349.04,1.96,1.0,OK 11 create idea.

36143,PS5,3,354.32,354.8,0.48,1.0,Just one.
36143,PS5,3,355.24,359.44,4.2,2.0,So I I guess maybe the survey would be the best.
36143,PS5,3,359.64,360.08,0.44,1.0,To start.
36143,PS5,3,360.76,363.84,3.08,2.0,And then adapt to that.
36143,PS5,3,363.96,366.72,2.76,2.0,"It's very creative, but it feels like I."
36143,PS5,3,366.8,375.6,8.8,3.0,Think you can leave the like our previous notes so that we can we can generate our ideas.
36143,PS5,3,376.72,378.44,1.72,2.0,"Yeah, it will be out for the next time."
36143,PS5,3,381.28,385.6,4.32,1.0,Great to survey about the need for certification.
36143,PS5,3,385.6,388.4,2.8,1.0,Anonymous for employee.
36143,PS5,3,395.52,407.2,11.68,2.0,And then maybe from that builds A voluntary employee efficient strategy or something to improve the benefits.
36143,PS5,3,409.76,425.0,15.24,2.0,"Yeah, I guess you could also, if you wanted to make it more personal, you could maybe like interview like just maybe once a year, sit down with the employee individually and just ask them, you know, are you happy at this company?"
36143,PS5,3,425.08,425.92,0.84,2.0,What can we do?
36143,PS5,3,426.48,430.4,3.92,2.0,"And maybe, maybe the employee would say, yeah, I want a triple increase in my salary."
36143,PS5,3,430.4,436.04,5.64,2.0,"And then they go, OK, we can't do that, but it could be good to know the specific needs of the the."
36143,PS5,3,437.36,439.08,1.72,1.0,The keywords and needs right?
36143,PS5,3,439.76,440.72,0.96,1.0,The keyword is me.

36143,PS5,3,451.56,460.36,8.8,3.0,"Yeah, I think once we know about the needs of the employees, we might need collaboration of different department."
36143,PS5,3,460.76,461.76,1.0,2.0,"OK, Yeah."
36143,PS5,3,461.96,475.08,13.12,3.0,"Let's say if the employee employee wants higher salary or more efficient collaboration or working efficiency, they might need the help from different."

36284,PS4,3,67.44,68.8,1.36,2.0,But right now it's already mandatory.
36284,PS4,3,68.8,70.16,1.36,2.0,"OK, so wait, so academic."
36284,PS4,3,71.16,72.2,1.04,2.0,So right now it's not already.
36284,PS4,3,72.2,74.6,2.4,1.0,On a global basis or like a national basis?
36284,PS4,3,74.76,76.4,1.64,2.0,"I don't think it really, I mean it could be anything really."
36284,PS4,3,77.44,81.32,3.88,2.0,"I guess if you if you come up with an idea for the national setting, then you can try to scale it up if you really want."
36284,PS4,3,81.4,84.8,3.4,2.0,"But so it's already mandatory to have it to be educated, right?"
36284,PS4,3,84.8,86.68,1.88,2.0,"That's already mandatory at a certain age, I believe."
36284,PS4,3,86.84,88.8,1.96,2.0,So can we like?
36284,PS4,3,94.0,97.2,3.2,1.0,So we're talking about disadvantaged and marginalized groups.
36284,PS4,3,98.08,117.56,19.48,1.0,"What what where do what disadvantaged and marginalized groups have access to something like a like a some some, some, some technological, I don't know, like."
36284,PS4,3,120.16,122.48,2.32,2.0,Are you asking what might they have access to already?
36284,PS4,3,122.48,122.92,0.44,2.0,Yes.
36284,PS4,3,123.2,132.8,9.6,1.0,"What piece of technology or like any resource that disadvantage of margin like groups have access to it, right?"
36284,PS4,3,132.8,133.2,0.4,3.0,Now.
36284,PS4,3,133.6,139.68,6.08,1.0,So as to use it as a as a channel for for delivering educational material.
36284,PS4,3,140.44,141.0,0.56,2.0,"Well, OK, Tik."
36284,PS4,3,141.56,141.92,0.36,3.0,T.O.K.
36284,PS4,3,143.2,144.72,1.52,1.0,But do like like disadvantage.
36284,PS4,3,144.72,150.64,5.92,2.0,"That's also part of the disadvantage, right, 'cause if you're, I guess if you're quiet, I don't know if that's, I guess the least, well, I'm not sure if the least."
36284,PS4,3,150.64,162.88,12.24,2.0,"But like a lot of like if you think about at least the like the conventional poverty kind of issue that would be delivering it in the open, like in the physical space, because then everyone would be able to, I guess presume like they would be able to be there without need for like access to digital materials, right."
36284,PS4,3,162.88,164.6,1.72,2.0,But I'm not sure if that's actually equitable or not.
36284,PS4,3,164.6,164.92,0.32,2.0,I'm not sure.
36284,PS4,3,167.76,168.24,0.48,2.0,Deliver.
36284,PS4,3,168.24,173.96,5.72,2.0,"OK, So we'll deliver education via widely accessible digital."
36284,PS4,3,174.28,177.84,3.56,2.0,"I mean, I guess the radio a lot of people have that's probably a very, very old."
36284,PS4,3,177.84,178.56,0.72,1.0,TV.
36284,PS4,3,179.28,179.64,0.36,1.0,TV.
36284,PS4,3,179.64,180.52,0.88,1.0,Maybe not everyone.
36284,PS4,3,185.28,193.56,8.28,2.0,"So I guess we have to find, I guess places where everyone gathers, even if like regardless of their income or whatever, just some kind of like I."
36284,PS4,3,194.72,195.04,0.32,1.0,Don't know.
36284,PS4,3,195.04,195.28,0.24,1.0,"Oh, my God."
36284,PS4,3,195.28,200.08,4.8,1.0,"I'm gonna go back to like, religion, educating church, educating people."
36284,PS4,3,200.08,200.84,0.76,1.0,"No, no."
36284,PS4,3,202.12,205.72,3.6,3.0,Is there any difference between academic resources and educational resources?
36284,PS4,3,205.88,206.64,0.76,1.0,"No, I was thinking."
36284,PS4,3,206.64,208.4,1.76,2.0,"I mean, yeah, yeah."
36284,PS4,3,210.04,211.76,1.72,2.0,What does that mean of academic?
36284,PS4,3,212.24,215.08,2.84,1.0,"Academic resources means like access to journals, books."
36284,PS4,3,216.08,217.08,1.0,2.0,'Cause I would say more thank you.
36284,PS4,3,217.12,218.24,1.12,1.0,Or physical.
36284,PS4,3,218.24,219.44,1.2,3.0,"Yeah, 'cause it's a higher education."
36284,PS4,3,220.4,221.4,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, it could be any education."
36284,PS4,3,221.4,222.48,1.08,1.0,"Actually, it could be anything."
36284,PS4,3,222.48,223.88,1.4,1.0,Academic resources could be anything.
36284,PS4,3,224.32,230.08,5.76,2.0,"I mean, obviously a very boring idea is like to make it free, but then like, I mean, that's not, not not creative at all."
36284,PS4,3,230.64,233.68,3.04,2.0,"I, I maybe there's like an incentive to use or something."
36284,PS4,3,233.96,237.64,3.68,1.0,But also the disadvantage that what does we What does it mean disadvantage?
36284,PS4,3,237.64,240.2,2.56,1.0,Disadvantage means physically disadvantaged.
36284,PS4,3,240.48,242.2,1.72,2.0,"I was thinking mostly poverty, but it could also be."
36284,PS4,3,242.2,249.48,7.28,1.0,"Physical poverty, but it could also like neurodiversity related disadvantaged."
36284,PS4,3,249.92,255.68,5.76,1.0,"No, I think no yeah, I think it's I think it it's about economy here right."
36284,PS4,3,256.28,258.28,2.0,1.0,"It could be any it says disadvantage, it doesn't."
36284,PS4,3,258.28,260.6,2.32,1.0,It's not saying like disability or.
36284,PS4,3,261.36,265.0,3.64,2.0,"So marginalized groups could be anyone, it could be like raised, it could be anything, right."
36284,PS4,3,265.2,266.68,1.48,2.0,"So that's it's a bit different, yeah."
36284,PS4,3,267.6,273.0,5.4,2.0,"I mean, I guess if we're talking about like neurodiversity, then you could try to improve it because like in that case, people are not educated in the world."
36284,PS4,3,273.0,274.72,1.72,1.0,"No, let's just make an assumption that we were talking."
36284,PS4,3,274.72,275.28,0.56,2.0,About poverty.
36284,PS4,3,275.56,282.88,7.32,1.0,Poverty or access and not like any sort of disability if like physical or mental disability.
36284,PS4,3,287.52,287.72,0.2,2.0,Access.
36284,PS4,3,287.72,292.0,4.28,2.0,"So I guess you could think about what is it, digital, whatever."
36284,PS4,3,292.08,300.12,8.04,2.0,"OK, so including this one, yeah, yeah, I'm trying."
36284,PS4,3,300.36,301.76,1.4,2.0,This is quite difficult.
36284,PS4,3,304.76,315.56,10.8,2.0,"So I suppose you could get, you could educate some people in the community and then allow train them to educate other people who primarily wouldn't necessarily come to education themselves."
36284,PS4,3,315.84,324.2,8.36,2.0,"Could you could create that kind of, you know, that kind of system, you know, just to train, train the, you know, people in the community to dedicate each other, but that."
36284,PS4,3,324.36,325.8,1.44,1.0,What was happening in the past?
36284,PS4,3,325.88,332.88,7.0,1.0,"I mean, how did marginalized groups that wanted to educate themselves were educated themselves like."
36284,PS4,3,333.04,333.36,0.32,2.0,Through I guess.
36284,PS4,3,334.76,347.0,12.24,1.0,"OK, what what are what are ways to, you know, access this community's in an efficient and cost efficient, cost effective way?"
36284,PS4,3,349.96,360.68,10.72,2.0,"I, I guess, I mean, that's probably due to like if you think or in the past when very few people were going to university, right, That probably changed due to, well, maybe improved living standards for some people."
36284,PS4,3,360.68,365.8,5.12,2.0,I mean you earn more but also possibly the reduced cost of the education itself which is quite boring though as I'm not sure.
36284,PS4,3,366.44,368.4,1.96,1.0,Now the the question is how?
36284,PS4,3,369.24,373.56,4.32,1.0,Please come up with that creative video to overcome inequality in education.
36284,PS4,3,373.68,393.92,20.24,1.0,"That does not necessarily mean that providing equal education to anyone, but also maybe recognizing that some groups are disadvantaged or disabled in terms of having access to educational resources and therefore give them some sort of a premium when they applied to universities."
36284,PS4,3,394.48,394.84,0.36,2.0,Or.
36284,PS4,3,395.32,402.96,7.64,1.0,"Or like bonus, like give them bonuses recognizing the fact that they were bullshit."
36284,PS4,3,403.0,403.68,0.68,1.0,I'm saying bullshit.
36284,PS4,3,405.32,406.96,1.64,2.0,"I mean, so that I guess that is practice, right?"
36284,PS4,3,406.96,410.76,3.8,2.0,"Like in terms of like admissions, right, of like, oh, you were in the yeah, that's OK."
36284,PS4,3,410.76,413.24,2.48,2.0,"So, you know, use what is it called?"
36284,PS4,3,413.96,415.6,1.64,1.0,Equity and equality in.
36284,PS4,3,417.48,419.64,2.16,2.0,Contextual person.
36284,PS4,3,420.16,426.12,5.96,2.0,"I mean, I OK, so it's like a really radical idea."
36284,PS4,3,426.12,435.84,9.72,2.0,"I'm trying to think you think about like that, that traditional, I'm not gonna search it up 'cause I can't do that, that graphic."
36284,PS4,3,435.84,437.88,2.04,2.0,"You need to think about inequality and like, what's equity?"
36284,PS4,3,437.88,441.12,3.24,2.0,"So that the inequality is like, no, sorry, sorry."
36284,PS4,3,441.2,442.8,1.6,2.0,Equality is like everyone having.
36284,PS4,3,442.8,444.88,2.08,2.0,"So let's say there are two, three people of different heights."
36284,PS4,3,445.44,449.44,4.0,2.0,And so I guess equality would be having everyone on the same like stool they're standing.
36284,PS4,3,449.44,455.68,6.24,2.0,"And then whereas if it's equity, it would be the, the taller person has like a very short stool and this, this, this shorter person has like a very tall stool."
36284,PS4,3,455.84,457.44,1.6,2.0,And so eventually they're reaching the same point.
36284,PS4,3,458.36,460.08,1.72,2.0,So what is the equivalent of that in the sense?
36284,PS4,3,462.84,463.76,0.92,1.0,Personalization.
36284,PS4,3,464.36,464.76,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
36284,PS4,3,464.76,474.36,9.6,2.0,"But then we're talking about like, is it that they need the different educational, like is their education meant to be different or is it just that some people are meant to get more access because they're traditionally isn't it?"
36284,PS4,3,474.4,475.2,0.8,2.0,I'm not sure which one it is.
36284,PS4,3,475.2,475.64,0.44,2.0,It's different.
36284,PS4,3,477.04,479.64,2.6,1.0,You're talking about whether this is inequity or inequality.
36284,PS4,3,479.8,481.48,1.68,2.0,"I mean, I'm guessing it's inequity, right?"
36284,PS4,3,481.48,482.76,1.28,2.0,Because it wouldn't be it.
36284,PS4,3,484.28,485.84,1.56,2.0,"Oh, it says here, it says inequality."
36284,PS4,3,485.88,486.56,0.68,2.0,Never mind.
36284,PS4,3,493.64,494.4,0.76,1.0,I'm so tired.
36284,PS4,3,495.0,500.0,5.0,2.0,"It's quite difficult, I guess."
36284,PS4,3,500.04,500.84,0.8,2.0,"I mean, I don't know."
36284,PS4,3,500.84,510.8,9.96,2.0,"I guess the smaller problem is like the fact that some people, you know, they have no access to food when they go to school and that might be a barrier to their actual learning."
36284,PS4,3,511.16,512.48,1.32,2.0,So could we do anything about that?
36284,PS4,3,512.48,514.08,1.6,2.0,That's like a smaller problem within the problem.
36284,PS4,3,515.04,517.96,2.92,1.0,"No, but it's like an equal distribution of academic resources."
36284,PS4,3,518.2,522.48,4.28,1.0,So the matter is like the one step before that it's they don't have the resources.
36284,PS4,3,522.48,524.0,1.52,1.0,It's not that they're not using the.
36284,PS4,3,524.0,526.04,2.04,2.0,"Resources, I mean, in that case, it sounds really going all the time."
36284,PS4,3,526.04,531.8,5.76,2.0,"Maybe we should probably think about like the, you know, what's it called, how we deliver the education."
36284,PS4,3,531.8,535.2,3.4,2.0,"In that case, we probably have to focus on like this kind of thing, right, 'cause otherwise, yeah, I don't."
36284,PS4,3,535.68,538.12,2.44,2.0,"Oh my gosh, what's this?"
36284,PS4,3,538.12,538.24,0.12,2.0,OK.
36284,PS4,3,540.44,543.04,2.6,2.0,So are there any other ways to deliver?
36284,PS4,3,543.12,554.4,11.28,1.0,"Change the way we deliver education and deliver education through radio or, you know, things like that."
36284,PS4,3,554.52,554.8,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36284,PS4,3,554.8,555.48,0.68,1.0,Or podcasts.
36284,PS4,3,555.48,556.64,1.16,2.0,Or I have a stupid obviously.
36284,PS4,3,556.76,561.4,4.64,2.0,So what if you can implant things in the brain that provide education.
36284,PS4,3,561.48,566.2,4.72,2.0,This is very and prioritize people who are traditionally disadvantaged in the implantation.
36284,PS4,3,566.6,567.56,0.96,1.0,Of this who's gonna pay for?
36284,PS4,3,568.32,570.24,1.92,2.0,"The IT doesn't matter who the pay is, the creativity."
36284,PS4,3,572.36,573.92,1.56,1.0,That's why I said how realistic we should be.
36284,PS4,3,584.12,596.28,12.16,3.0,"I'm not sure if there is any difference between academic resources and academic opportunities or chances by by, for example, the contextual offers provided to SO."
36284,PS4,3,596.28,597.28,1.0,2.0,"That's the chances, right?"
36284,PS4,3,597.64,599.28,1.64,3.0,"Yes, it is a chance."
36284,PS4,3,599.28,599.8,0.52,2.0,That's different.
36284,PS4,3,599.92,600.2,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36284,PS4,3,602.08,611.48,9.4,2.0,"So I guess in that case, it's like more, it's kind of making the distribution more equal so that in the future they'll have more resources, even though if they're in the past they were disadvantaged."
36284,PS4,3,611.52,612.76,1.24,2.0,That's like a evening out.
36284,PS4,3,613.16,614.96,1.8,2.0,"But yeah, I don't know if it's the same."
36284,PS4,3,614.96,616.24,1.28,2.0,"I mean, I'm leaning towards 2 right now."
36284,PS4,3,616.24,617.4,1.16,2.0,I'm not sure how we can improve.
36284,PS4,3,617.4,620.12,2.72,1.0,It let's do 2 guys.
36284,PS4,3,620.12,620.32,0.2,1.0,I don't.
36284,PS4,3,620.32,620.88,0.56,2.0,Think we can?
36284,PS4,3,621.24,621.52,0.28,1.0,Come is.
36284,PS4,3,622.12,623.6,1.48,2.0,"That it OK, we didn't fail."
36284,PS4,3,624.0,627.68,3.68,2.0,"OK, How did I?"
36175,PS6,3,2.64,7.64,5.0,1.0,I mentioned a new research that they discovered that singing the Java treatment is always good for health.
36175,PS6,3,8.2,12.52,4.32,1.0,Please come up with a great idea to encourage people to do this.
36175,PS6,3,13.76,19.24,5.48,2.0,Is this for like the public ad like?
36175,PS6,3,20.32,22.56,2.24,1.0,I guess maybe that's up to us.
36175,PS6,3,24.72,26.08,1.36,2.0,Just have some answers.
36175,PS6,3,26.36,33.92,7.56,1.0,"Like I guess it could either be and like, I guess there's many different routes we could get on, right?"
36175,PS6,3,33.92,39.44,5.52,1.0,"We could get on like some kind of product like product, isn't it product or it could be like a like a campaign or not."
36175,PS6,3,41.2,42.32,1.12,2.0,Singing shower.
36175,PS6,3,42.32,43.2,0.88,2.0,Like a shower.
36175,PS6,3,43.2,44.44,1.24,2.0,"Karaoke, yeah."
36175,PS6,3,44.84,45.36,0.52,2.0,Microphone.
36175,PS6,3,46.44,47.84,1.4,2.0,Like waterproof microphone?
36175,PS6,3,47.84,48.12,0.28,2.0,"Yeah, seems."
36175,PS6,3,49.04,49.24,0.2,1.0,Like a.
36175,PS6,3,49.92,50.04,0.12,2.0,Good.
36175,PS6,3,50.64,64.28,13.64,1.0,"Time, but just like write everything we OK, we have like 12 minutes I think so we can discuss and then we can like because we want to come up with the most creative idea so we can keep chatting for that."
36175,PS6,3,66.4,69.2,2.8,1.0,I mean one creative idea.
36175,PS6,3,69.2,70.32,1.12,1.0,"I mean, what are we trying to do?"
36175,PS6,3,70.32,71.48,1.16,1.0,Are we trying to be the most creative?
36175,PS6,3,71.48,74.6,3.12,1.0,Are we trying to be the most sensible?
36175,PS6,3,80.52,82.6,2.08,1.0,"OK, well, how would the character, What would it be?"
36175,PS6,3,83.4,83.8,0.4,1.0,Karaoke's.
36175,PS6,3,83.8,87.04,3.24,1.0,"Normally they're like multiple people, right?"
36175,PS6,3,87.4,90.88,3.48,1.0,"Yeah, you'll just be doing it to yourself, like just sets."
36175,PS6,3,93.64,94.56,0.92,2.0,Like a like a robot.
36175,PS6,3,94.8,99.08,4.28,2.0,"Like instead of a karaoke machine, it's this robot standing there singing with you."
36175,PS6,3,99.08,103.88,4.8,2.0,"I don't know, but like with your compliment, musical compliment."
36175,PS6,3,104.16,105.0,0.84,1.0,"A robot, yeah."
36175,PS6,3,106.28,107.52,1.24,1.0,It's just like the music.
36175,PS6,3,107.52,110.0,2.48,1.0,It's kind of speakers.
36175,PS6,3,112.92,119.96,7.04,1.0,Would it be like some kind of like competitive to be like somehow like automatically score your same?
36175,PS6,3,120.28,121.08,0.8,2.0,Medicine.
36175,PS6,3,123.04,128.08,5.04,1.0,I wonder whether whether it would work to like have it sort of like automatically scores your performance.
36175,PS6,3,128.84,130.36,1.52,1.0,"So it's like competitive, so like a."
36175,PS6,3,130.4,132.8,2.4,2.0,"Competitive, like making it a video game."
36175,PS6,3,133.48,134.0,0.52,1.0,"Maybe, yeah."
36175,PS6,3,134.68,148.2,13.52,2.0,Interactive like game with a robot like some sort of gaming device like in in the shower yeah shower Xbox karaoke version I'm.
36175,PS6,3,152.44,153.72,1.28,1.0,Just I think that's a good idea.
36175,PS6,3,156.52,159.52,3.0,1.0,Maybe let's discuss a couple of that.
36175,PS6,3,160.68,161.76,1.08,1.0,"If not, we can just go for that."
36175,PS6,3,162.64,163.72,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, just go for that."
36175,PS6,3,164.16,165.52,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36175,PS6,3,166.12,166.76,0.64,1.0,So what should I say?
36175,PS6,3,166.76,186.4,19.64,1.0,So can you spell karaoke?
36175,PS6,3,186.48,188.6,2.12,1.0,"Karaoke, yes."
36175,PS6,3,193.36,201.68,8.32,1.0,And with what to mic speakers?
36175,PS6,3,206.88,208.24,1.36,1.0,"I guess we'd need a screen as well, right?"
36175,PS6,3,208.24,208.44,0.2,1.0,I want.
36175,PS6,3,212.28,215.16,2.88,2.0,The projector projected on the.
36175,PS6,3,215.64,215.76,0.12,1.0,Wall.
36175,PS6,3,215.76,220.28,4.52,1.0,"If it's like light, the shower's quite light there, so you probably wouldn't be able to think it needs to be some kind of display."
36175,PS6,3,220.64,221.92,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, just display with his face."
36175,PS6,3,222.04,225.64,3.6,2.0,"Oh, look at VRVR goggles."
36175,PS6,3,226.12,227.04,0.92,3.0,"Wait, VR in the shower?"
36175,PS6,3,227.04,227.96,0.92,3.0,Are you going to be showering?
36175,PS6,3,231.16,248.76,17.6,1.0,Speakers and monitor like display for lyrics and I mean how do we make it last 20 minutes?
36175,PS6,3,248.76,251.4,2.64,1.0,I guess you just like has a timer.
36175,PS6,3,257.08,276.04,18.96,1.0,"I guess maybe we need to have it like unlock something and like, yeah, 20 minute time once that is reached continuous, what would be like if I level up or something?"
36175,PS6,3,278.44,280.4,1.96,2.0,Some sort sort of reward?
36175,PS6,3,281.56,282.0,0.44,1.0,How would it?
36175,PS6,3,282.0,282.64,0.64,1.0,What would it be then?
36175,PS6,3,282.76,283.04,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36175,PS6,3,283.76,284.56,0.8,2.0,Like what?
36175,PS6,3,284.72,288.68,3.96,2.0,"I don't really do games, but sort of rewards are there in games."
36175,PS6,3,288.96,293.68,4.72,1.0,"Too many games, but I guess like usually it'd be some kind of like currency I guess, that you can use, yeah."
36175,PS6,3,293.92,294.88,0.96,2.0,Maybe gaming currency?
36175,PS6,3,295.92,299.08,3.16,1.0,But you could you can maybe use it to like unlock new songs maybe?
36175,PS6,3,299.84,301.28,1.44,2.0,"Oh, new era, new."
36175,PS6,3,304.16,307.96,3.8,1.0,"Songs My son is Reach, yeah."
36175,PS6,3,308.28,311.52,3.24,2.0,Like like songs that will not be available on like.
36175,PS6,3,311.88,333.64,21.76,1.0,Credits to unlock new songs next time OK just to make we could like you could also multiple users have some kind.
36175,PS6,3,334.12,334.8,0.68,2.0,Like maybe not.
36175,PS6,3,335.2,335.92,0.72,1.0,Leaderboard.
36175,PS6,3,336.96,339.24,2.28,1.0,"Oh yeah, it could be, oh, it doesn't need to be just in the house."
36175,PS6,3,340.12,345.84,5.72,1.0,I could use it and it could be a leaderboard.
36175,PS6,3,347.44,350.52,3.08,1.0,"I mean, is it just like who's singing the most or is it who's singing the best?"
36175,PS6,3,354.2,355.6,1.4,2.0,Some sort of ranking criteria?
36175,PS6,3,355.6,365.68,10.08,1.0,"That yeah, using a what to make it ranking criteria."
36175,PS6,3,372.16,374.8,2.64,1.0,So there needs to be some like AI.
36175,PS6,3,376.32,378.28,1.96,2.0,Baseball and AI model.
36175,PS6,3,394.09,395.77,1.68,1.0,"OK, good."
36175,PS6,3,395.93,396.25,0.32,1.0,Happy.
36175,PS6,3,397.13,397.49,0.36,1.0,All right.
34231,PS5,6,11.56,23.92,12.36,1.0,"Yeah, one creative ideas."
34231,PS5,6,32.12,32.8,0.68,3.0,Voluntary.
34231,PS5,6,32.84,33.28,0.44,1.0,Employee.
34231,PS5,6,34.84,35.96,1.12,4.0,Value talents in.
34231,PS5,6,37.28,38.08,0.8,5.0,It OK so.
34231,PS5,6,39.32,50.84,11.52,1.0,"One idea to stop them from leaving, getting the company and either we have preventative measures that prevent them from wanting to, so we stop it at the start of the problem."
34231,PS5,6,50.84,53.56,2.72,1.0,So we don't want make them don't want to quit in the 1st place.
34231,PS5,6,54.08,59.4,5.32,1.0,"Or once they want to quit, we we discover that and then we stop them."
34231,PS5,6,59.6,63.52,3.92,1.0,"So it's like 2 sort 2 ideas, you know what I mean?"
34231,PS5,6,63.72,68.04,4.32,1.0,"Like before they want to quit, you make it good enough that they don't even think about wanting to quit."
34231,PS5,6,68.96,71.76,2.8,3.0,"Recently there was a Chinese tech company that used cheerleaders, right?"
34231,PS5,6,72.0,72.8,0.8,3.0,"You can, yeah."
34231,PS5,6,74.44,76.8,2.36,3.0,"Cheerleaders for the for, Yeah."
34231,PS5,6,76.8,82.48,5.68,3.0,"So cheerleaders in the office for software engineers in our own idea, I think."
34231,PS5,6,82.68,86.52,3.84,6.0,I think makes sense to understand versus psychology beyond why they started.
34231,PS5,6,87.0,92.4,5.4,4.0,"So yeah, I guess the first thing is really to understand the reason behind it because they're living voluntarily."
34231,PS5,6,92.64,95.28,2.64,4.0,So there must be a reason first.
34231,PS5,6,95.28,100.16,4.88,4.0,Obviously understand what's happening are are they getting hired by someone else?
34231,PS5,6,100.16,104.24,4.08,4.0,Are they getting better offers because it's talking about rates?
34231,PS5,6,104.32,104.52,0.2,4.0,No.
34231,PS5,6,104.68,109.4,4.72,4.0,"Oh no, are they, is it, is it because we're, we're not doing good enough?"
34231,PS5,6,109.48,112.52,3.04,4.0,"Or is, is it because there's some change in the industry?"
34231,PS5,6,112.52,117.68,5.16,4.0,"So first, it's definitely to understand the reason and we can do different things to to do that."
34231,PS5,6,117.92,142.8,24.88,4.0,"There can be service, there can be HR one to one talks to the people who are living and also to the people who are still in the company just to understand what's happening, you know, So first is to understand, let's say research and then based on the specific reason were trends that's happening, Let's say if there's a market, there's a new company that's hiring from our company, then then we might want to stop it, you know, talk to them."
34231,PS5,6,143.2,163.36,20.16,4.0,"In fact, I saw this news that when Microsoft no with Adobe tries to hire, hire people from Apple when Steve Jobs was still there, Steve Jobs simply sent an e-mail to Adobe addressing this issue and says if you don't stop, we will pay more to hire people from Adobe to Apple."
34231,PS5,6,164.48,165.8,1.32,4.0,And that really just stopped them.
34231,PS5,6,165.96,171.24,5.28,4.0,"That just stopped Adobe HR to hire anyone from, you know, like these people from from Apple."
34231,PS5,6,171.44,174.12,2.68,4.0,"So the first thing is really to understand what's going on, I guess."
34231,PS5,6,175.04,176.12,1.08,1.0,Where are they leaving to?
34231,PS5,6,176.12,177.04,0.92,1.0,Why are they leaving?
34231,PS5,6,177.16,177.4,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,177.56,178.72,1.16,4.0,Why and where exactly?
34231,PS5,6,179.56,179.92,0.36,5.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,179.92,181.4,1.48,5.0,Also we need to motivate them to stay.
34231,PS5,6,181.4,185.76,4.36,5.0,"You know, one thing that's happening quite a lot recently is the employee shared schemes."
34231,PS5,6,185.76,189.08,3.32,5.0,"Have you had that show the companies give shares, right?"
34231,PS5,6,189.72,190.12,0.4,5.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,190.8,202.44,11.64,5.0,So it motivates them to stay in the company and they want to do the company well because the search share is going to go up another price like and there's some companies say that you can only get your shares after being with us for four years or five years.
34231,PS5,6,202.72,204.76,2.04,5.0,They have friends who are in this kind of schemes.
34231,PS5,6,205.12,212.16,7.04,5.0,"They're not interested to live because of that, because you want to take the shirts in four years, five years time, and we want to be able to work as well."
34231,PS5,6,212.36,214.12,1.76,4.0,I just had AI don't know.
34231,PS5,6,214.48,214.92,0.44,6.0,It could be.
34231,PS5,6,215.2,215.64,0.44,4.0,Creative.
34231,PS5,6,215.68,225.76,10.08,4.0,"I don't know if it is so if I we want to know what happened to them of course we can do research on ourself, but the best, the most direct solution is to let the employee tell us right?"
34231,PS5,6,226.52,233.6,7.08,4.0,"But they won't tell us because we we don't want to do a face to face because they won't be telling the truth, right."
34231,PS5,6,233.96,240.88,6.92,4.0,"So if there could somehow the company could somehow build a trusted shudong, what is it called?"
34231,PS5,6,241.56,260.0,18.44,4.0,Like a like a like place where where employees can complain or just tell company fully anonymous not traceable at all that why are they considered living and the company promise that they will act upon it then I don't know my work.
34231,PS5,6,260.04,271.12,11.08,1.0,So basically another HR department that is that is different from regular HR because regular HR is for the company or for the people you're thinking about creating a department.
34231,PS5,6,272.6,274.4,1.8,4.0,"I think it's more like just events, OK."
34231,PS5,6,275.08,275.52,0.44,3.0,That's the thing.
34231,PS5,6,275.52,275.72,0.2,3.0,What?
34231,PS5,6,276.56,278.24,1.68,2.0,We see like in daily life.
34231,PS5,6,278.28,280.44,2.16,3.0,"Like, I mean, we direct the conversation, right?"
34231,PS5,6,280.44,282.08,1.64,3.0,"Yes, psychology is important."
34231,PS5,6,282.08,283.64,1.56,3.0,We are not examining the psychology.
34231,PS5,6,284.2,286.08,1.88,3.0,We are coming up with a crazy idea to stop this.
34231,PS5,6,286.24,288.44,2.2,3.0,"Like yes, we need to know what happens and how do we stop it, but."
34231,PS5,6,288.44,289.16,0.72,2.0,Can we like?
34231,PS5,6,289.36,290.12,0.76,4.0,Even 10 times.
34231,PS5,6,290.12,291.12,1.0,5.0,One of the reason now they're.
34231,PS5,6,291.24,291.48,0.24,3.0,Kind.
34231,PS5,6,291.52,292.32,0.8,1.0,Of crazy like yeah.
34231,PS5,6,292.32,293.52,1.2,3.0,Sound of the world kind of thing.
34231,PS5,6,293.52,294.72,1.2,3.0,So that is what we are looking at.
34231,PS5,6,294.76,299.96,5.2,3.0,"It's a given discussion like RSU works, THR works, but these are things that that already exist, right?"
34231,PS5,6,299.96,319.92,19.96,2.0,"Can we do this like we recruit someone secretly like putting them into like each department and they are actually collecting data from the daily interaction with the employees like they are acting they are on this like their social media manager, but they're not actually they are acting as a collect point that's."
34231,PS5,6,321.24,321.4,0.16,5.0,What?
34231,PS5,6,322.08,322.36,0.28,4.0,"They do, yeah."
34231,PS5,6,324.44,326.12,1.68,4.0,Also for personal account it's hard to trace.
34231,PS5,6,326.4,332.08,5.68,1.0,"Yeah, and Even so like they don't they don't necessarily will tell their employees."
34231,PS5,6,332.64,335.36,2.72,1.0,"I'll tell the other friends that oh, I'm leaving for X company, Y company."
34231,PS5,6,335.48,337.28,1.8,1.0,"Usually some just like go, but."
34231,PS5,6,338.28,349.04,10.76,3.0,There is a company in Singapore that does something very wrong because employees find so fun they don't want to leave and that's what they do is they actually employees take part in many challenges like so they have a YouTube channel they are caught that's that's not local.
34231,PS5,6,349.24,353.4,4.16,3.0,"Not sure if you guys saw that, but basically they they take part in like they go overseas St."
34231,PS5,6,353.4,357.2,3.8,3.0,they take video mini blogs and posts on YouTube and then become like funny content for everybody else.
34231,PS5,6,357.2,361.44,4.24,3.0,And then they become like mini celebrities everyone to leave because every day going to work is just having fun.
34231,PS5,6,361.76,369.68,7.92,3.0,So you know one day you go in you're made to eat like 10 KG or during kind of thing next day you sunny monitor flying to Bali kind of thing and all for social media content.
34231,PS5,6,369.68,371.24,1.56,3.0,So that's that's literally their their job.
34231,PS5,6,371.24,371.88,0.64,3.0,That's what they do.
34231,PS5,6,372.24,378.88,6.64,3.0,"So yeah, so many of them, like, because they recently did a series like 1010 years ago asking why do you leave and stuff."
34231,PS5,6,379.24,381.12,1.88,3.0,Many of them said they couldn't leave.
34231,PS5,6,381.12,386.48,5.36,3.0,"Like they actually extended their that they know they should have left a long time ago, but they didn't leave simply because it was too fun."
34231,PS5,6,386.48,387.52,1.04,3.0,"It felt like college, everything."
34231,PS5,6,387.64,388.16,0.52,3.0,"Yes, yes."
34231,PS5,6,388.16,388.96,0.8,3.0,So that's something you can do.
34231,PS5,6,389.04,390.96,1.92,1.0,"So make it feel like college, like make it have fun."
34231,PS5,6,391.84,393.72,1.88,5.0,"Yeah, also flexibility as well."
34231,PS5,6,393.84,397.56,3.72,5.0,"I think for me, I wouldn't leave a job if I could work from wherever I want."
34231,PS5,6,397.56,403.92,6.36,5.0,You know for example work anytime I want and I can make my own schedule around the day not having to go in the office.
34231,PS5,6,404.28,404.4,0.12,4.0,So.
34231,PS5,6,404.4,404.84,0.44,5.0,Flexible.
34231,PS5,6,404.84,405.24,0.4,5.0,We have 5.
34231,PS5,6,405.24,406.32,1.08,4.0,Minutes flexible.
34231,PS5,6,406.32,407.4,1.08,4.0,We have to write it down.
34231,PS5,6,410.12,414.2,4.08,1.0,We still haven't figured out one idea like one idea.
34231,PS5,6,415.32,416.72,1.4,5.0,"One of them, of people, one."
34231,PS5,6,417.04,417.64,0.6,5.0,Just one.
34231,PS5,6,417.88,418.28,0.4,5.0,Just one.
34231,PS5,6,420.0,422.56,2.56,1.0,I haven't written anything because we need to decide on which one so.
34231,PS5,6,423.24,424.36,1.12,5.0,How many we've had so far?
34231,PS5,6,424.36,425.16,0.8,2.0,I want the college.
34231,PS5,6,425.72,429.0,3.28,1.0,Like I'm just thinking about how Google retains their employees like free food.
34231,PS5,6,429.2,429.56,0.36,4.0,OK.
34231,PS5,6,429.56,441.12,11.56,4.0,"So it's basically you pay a lot of course, and then you have the best, you have really good benefits, which is culture is a part of the benefit because you just say that and prestige is."
34231,PS5,6,441.48,442.64,1.16,1.0,Not really an idea.
34231,PS5,6,442.76,443.48,0.72,1.0,You can't like say.
34231,PS5,6,443.48,443.96,0.48,3.0,"Yeah, no, no."
34231,PS5,6,444.12,445.88,1.76,3.0,But prestige is definitely a country effect.
34231,PS5,6,445.88,446.32,0.44,3.0,"I mean, what?"
34231,PS5,6,446.76,450.44,3.68,3.0,"What can solidify that that prestige maybe like, but yeah."
34231,PS5,6,451.08,452.24,1.16,4.0,Another thing that could be fun.
34231,PS5,6,452.24,452.88,0.64,2.0,Can we do that?
34231,PS5,6,452.88,465.32,12.44,2.0,"If they want to leave, they can leave like, but can you return the retain their their their job And can, because it's like you can try for like half a year or something and you can you can come back later if you feel like you want to."
34231,PS5,6,465.8,466.12,0.32,5.0,Come no.
34231,PS5,6,466.68,468.2,1.52,1.0,"That's officially because they're still left, yeah."
34231,PS5,6,468.2,468.68,0.48,4.0,They're still left.
34231,PS5,6,469.16,471.8,2.64,1.0,"Yeah, like the point is we need to stop them from leaving in the 1st."
34231,PS5,6,471.88,481.48,9.6,4.0,"Place there was this fun case like you said, actually, if if you allow customers, if you allow employees to do what they want to do, which let's say within the company they start at Scihar."
34231,PS5,6,481.48,485.16,3.68,4.0,"So in small teams, let's say we started a small project just for ourselves."
34231,PS5,6,485.28,485.44,0.16,4.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,485.68,492.24,6.56,4.0,"But then if you encourage that, you're less likely to leave because you're working on something for yourself, right?"
34231,PS5,6,492.48,496.24,3.76,4.0,"If you leave this team and you go to another company, you won't be able to do this anymore."
34231,PS5,6,496.92,500.48,3.56,5.0,How much they all collectively leave us a team to carry on this project.
34231,PS5,6,502.08,505.8,3.72,1.0,Living with your coworkers is not the best idea.
34231,PS5,6,505.96,509.96,4.0,5.0,"Yes, I think this was mentioned."
34231,PS5,6,510.56,513.2,2.64,1.0,"A few units ago in India, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
34231,PS5,6,513.24,514.32,1.08,1.0,We didn't spend a course like that.
34231,PS5,6,514.76,515.0,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,515.16,522.24,7.08,1.0,So allowing them for freedom to pursue the own pursuit like pursue their own interest or projects.
34231,PS5,6,522.32,523.44,1.12,4.0,Not even a log.
34231,PS5,6,523.68,526.64,2.96,4.0,"Encouraging like have hackathons, have that culture."
34231,PS5,6,527.08,544.44,17.36,4.0,"Build that culture in the company where you encourage your employee to work on a side hustle project as teams from time to time and encourage them to report it to the company if it's actually promising, honestly, the the company can even consider to invest in it, right?"
34231,PS5,6,545.32,547.16,1.84,4.0,"But if not, they, it's their own project."
34231,PS5,6,548.16,561.6,13.44,4.0,"The reason why we do this is because we, we believe there's a chance that because they're working on things they want to work on, there's a less chance, there's a better chance they want to stay in the, in our organization so that they can still work with their colleagues."
34231,PS5,6,562.88,563.12,0.24,4.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,563.6,568.76,5.16,4.0,"Also, build a better culture where people are taking initiatives, you know, not just listening to their boss."
34231,PS5,6,569.72,571.08,1.36,5.0,Should go without them as a final.
34231,PS5,6,572.68,575.32,2.64,3.0,"No, I like 1 because it says creative of mind."
34231,PS5,6,575.32,577.72,2.4,3.0,"It's just everywhere, you know, like interesting example."
34231,PS5,6,577.8,580.72,2.92,3.0,You know what happens to you when you what you try and quit.
34231,PS5,6,580.88,582.44,1.56,3.0,You know what's the yakuza like?
34231,PS5,6,582.64,583.4,0.76,3.0,Japanese gangster?
34231,PS5,6,583.4,584.6,1.2,3.0,Do you know what happened if you try and quit?
34231,PS5,6,585.2,585.88,0.68,3.0,So what's OK?
34231,PS5,6,585.88,590.24,4.36,3.0,"So the quitting ceremony involves you taking a leaf from the top down, and then they'll bash you in the leaf."
34231,PS5,6,592.08,593.0,0.92,3.0,"Leave your life, you get to go."
34231,PS5,6,593.16,593.84,0.68,5.0,This is.
34231,PS5,6,593.84,594.48,0.64,5.0,This is creative.
34231,PS5,6,595.4,604.0,8.6,5.0,This is and.
34231,PS5,6,604.4,605.44,1.04,3.0,Then you color your pinky.
34231,PS5,6,606.48,606.68,0.2,3.0,Really.
34231,PS5,6,606.68,607.48,0.8,3.0,That's what they are going.
34231,PS5,6,607.48,608.2,0.72,5.0,To do yes so.
34231,PS5,6,610.48,611.6,1.12,3.0,"They punch you, they hit you."
34231,PS5,6,620.08,621.32,1.24,3.0,"It's the most creative, right?"
34231,PS5,6,621.32,622.16,0.84,3.0,Not the most logical.
34231,PS5,6,622.2,622.72,0.52,3.0,"So it's like, yeah."
34231,PS5,6,624.64,636.0,11.36,5.0,"If you live with some of your head, that's funny this you need to know the resources as well."
34231,PS5,6,636.0,652.8,16.8,5.0,"I mean, do you think this idea you had, because most startups, most business go have the resources that are money, maybe it's Google, yes, big companies and they can allow freedom to employee, I mean a lot of free stuff, but it's going to be the case for every kind of business and average business."
34231,PS5,6,652.96,656.88,3.92,4.0,"I mean, you don't, I don't think the the company actually pays a lot."
34231,PS5,6,656.88,663.56,6.68,4.0,"So what you what you really do is like once a month or once a few months, let's say you host a hackathon which passes for a day."
34231,PS5,6,663.68,664.6,0.92,5.0,Or it's quite and.
34231,PS5,6,664.6,669.88,5.28,4.0,"Then and then you just, you're all you're doing is not stopping your employee from doing their own thing."
34231,PS5,6,670.28,673.76,3.48,4.0,"So like, and it's not like they will do it during work time."
34231,PS5,6,674.0,678.24,4.24,4.0,"You might voluntarily do it after work, like the group up and do it yourself."
34231,PS5,6,678.48,679.48,1.0,4.0,That's fully possible.
34231,PS5,6,679.76,689.36,9.6,4.0,"And there's no reason for it to stop them because first, there's a good chance that they can bring it up to the companies and the company can consider invest in them or turn it into internal project and grow it."
34231,PS5,6,689.84,692.36,2.52,4.0,"Second, if they do want to leave, then they're just good talents."
34231,PS5,6,692.36,693.12,0.76,4.0,They'll leave anyway.
34231,PS5,6,693.2,696.72,3.52,4.0,This is just how you track attracts.
34231,PS5,6,697.16,700.76,3.6,4.0,I mean maintain like the individual members within the groups.
34231,PS5,6,701.04,702.24,1.2,4.0,"Yes, I think so."
34231,PS5,6,702.36,712.84,10.48,2.0,"This is quite a good strategy, but I think this strategy only addressed those people who leave the company for their own pursuit of business or venture, I thought."
34231,PS5,6,712.84,713.12,0.28,1.0,We can't.
34231,PS5,6,713.12,713.88,0.76,1.0,Maybe we can't have.
34231,PS5,6,713.88,714.56,0.68,1.0,"I know, I'm just saying I."
34231,PS5,6,714.56,715.08,0.52,2.0,Agree with that.
34231,PS5,6,715.12,716.6,1.48,2.0,We're just going to put it.
34231,PS5,6,717.2,718.16,0.96,2.0,I'm just saying.
34231,PS5,6,718.48,719.32,0.84,6.0,15 seconds to.
34231,PS5,6,719.68,721.84,2.16,1.0,"Alright, next, have you just done?"
34231,PS5,6,722.32,722.48,0.16,6.0,Yeah.
34231,PS5,6,722.8,723.12,0.32,5.0,That's fine.
34231,PS5,6,723.28,723.56,0.28,5.0,Thank you.
34231,PS5,6,724.44,725.08,0.64,5.0,That was fun.
34231,PS5,6,725.08,725.4,0.32,5.0,OK.
35192,PS5,3,1.28,3.16,1.88,1.0,I think we came up with more than one idea.
35192,PS5,3,3.68,4.24,0.56,2.0,"Oh, OK."
35192,PS5,3,7.32,8.4,1.08,1.0,Voluntary attrition.
35192,PS5,3,20.56,23.08,2.52,2.0,"So that's basically when people quit, OK?"
35192,PS5,3,23.64,25.96,2.32,2.0,So how to keep people from quitting?
35192,PS5,3,27.04,27.48,0.44,2.0,OK.
35192,PS5,3,31.48,33.76,2.28,1.0,Troubleshooting beforehand.
35192,PS5,3,34.4,35.52,1.12,2.0,"Yeah, having like."
35192,PS5,3,35.56,43.6,8.04,1.0,Appraisals where you discuss with staff what the issues are and work towards addressing them.
35192,PS5,3,43.6,51.68,8.08,1.0,"I mean, even the step of asking people could make them feel hard and stick around to see if they would be changed."
35192,PS5,3,51.8,52.12,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35192,PS5,3,53.04,61.88,8.84,2.0,"So regular appraisals or, you know, just meetings, you know, just whatever."
35192,PS5,3,61.96,66.4,4.44,2.0,"I'll know what they're called and yeah, go ahead in my."
35192,PS5,3,66.4,72.68,6.28,3.0,Experience employee who would like to quit or suddenly would like to quit.
35192,PS5,3,73.12,84.64,11.52,3.0,"Most of the reason that is related to the humans interaction, not the content of the book, the content of the work."
35192,PS5,3,84.64,103.04,18.4,3.0,"We can, yeah, of course we can try to improve the content of the work and I think probably, oh, let's just share that my experience, but I have, I haven't have the creative idea."
35192,PS5,3,104.92,116.96,12.04,1.0,"Yeah, so you're saying people quit because of the work, not the workload, but because of interactions with different people, usually the bosses, I guess."
35192,PS5,3,117.76,118.04,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS5,3,118.6,119.64,1.04,2.0,"Oh, well, yeah, I guess."
35192,PS5,3,119.72,129.2,9.48,2.0,"And also, I suppose other colleagues, you know, if like they're not able to work as a team, well, with somebody like maybe somebody's too bossy or somebody's, you know, whatever."
35192,PS5,3,130.92,144.32,13.4,2.0,"So I like in general, like maybe, yeah, like, like you said, like regular appraisals to find out how they're doing and, you know, how they can improve and how the employee can help them in whatever way."
35192,PS5,3,144.84,152.68,7.84,2.0,"Maybe like easy, easier ways to resolve any types of conflicts between people so that it's not too difficult."
35192,PS5,3,152.68,155.96,3.28,2.0,"You know, that or they don't feel like they're, there's no one there to help them."
35192,PS5,3,155.96,165.84,9.88,2.0,"You know, that there should be a way for me to go to my manager and say I have a problem with this or that, but then we have to find a creative way."
35192,PS5,3,167.56,169.64,2.08,2.0,"Yeah, it's a creative way."
35192,PS5,3,172.56,183.04,10.48,1.0,"Well, OK, it's having anonymous feedback, sort of creative it."
35192,PS5,3,185.72,195.52,9.8,2.0,"Could be, I suppose, creative way."
35192,PS5,3,195.52,199.8,4.28,2.0,"I mean like in the end a lot of people quit or decide to, you know, leave."
35192,PS5,3,200.8,206.52,5.72,2.0,"Well, sometimes they leave because they got found a better job somewhere else, more money or something."
35192,PS5,3,208.28,210.32,2.04,2.0,But maybe some people could because they're unhappy.
35192,PS5,3,211.12,214.8,3.68,2.0,So ways to make their job more enjoyable or happy.
35192,PS5,3,214.8,243.0,28.2,2.0,"Maybe we can just focus on one thing and like a creative way to do like that or do something, you know, you know, to have like, you know, team bonding, you know, going out to do some game or you know, like like laser tag, you know, whatever, or bowling or something, you know, something creative like like a team building activity so that they want to stay."
35192,PS5,3,243.0,256.0,13.0,2.0,"And because it's a good company, not just because you make good money, but because you enjoy the job, you enjoy your colleagues, and you like to see them both in work and then outside."
35192,PS5,3,256.08,258.36,2.28,3.0,"Of work, yes, yes, that's helpful that's."
35192,PS5,3,282.09,282.37,0.28,2.0,Helpful.
35192,PS5,3,282.37,282.49,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS5,3,282.49,291.52,9.03,2.0,"Like, you know, it has to be something, you know, that would try to help all the time, right?"
35192,PS5,3,291.52,310.76,19.24,2.0,"Because, you know, like we every like week on week, you know, because if yeah, you have it, like I say, a Christmas party now, but then after Christmas there's nothing, you know, until like next summer, you know, we have to figure out some way to like keep people interested in the work all year round and not want to leave."
35192,PS5,3,311.52,316.36,4.84,3.0,"Yeah, I think probably food is good."
35192,PS5,3,318.36,322.16,3.8,3.0,So like by week we can have a pizza time.
35192,PS5,3,322.96,323.24,0.28,2.0,And.
35192,PS5,3,323.56,348.48,24.92,3.0,"During the pizza time, you can or you can also either invite your family member to join or any, any, any friend to join and probably just one afternoon and yeah, have a relaxed time."
35192,PS5,3,348.48,357.52,9.04,3.0,I I believe that just bi weekly and the one afternoon is will not damage our our business.
35192,PS5,3,358.96,364.96,6.0,2.0,"Yeah, I think that might be more worth it than if you suddenly someone quits and you have to hire another."
35192,PS5,3,364.96,378.08,13.12,2.0,"But you know, someone, you know, that's that the company might feel it's worth it to spend however much just to have some food or, you know, other than losing a good worker for, you know, forever, I don't know."
35192,PS5,3,378.28,379.2,0.92,1.0,How regular did?
35192,PS5,3,379.6,386.64,7.04,3.0,"You say by by week, like a two week, OK, because per week is too too frequent."
35192,PS5,3,387.76,399.64,11.88,2.0,"But like I've heard of other companies, many companies that do like casual Fridays or something where they don't have to wear, you know, the work uniform and you know, and they have, you know, like my, like what I'm like my wife."
35192,PS5,3,399.64,408.28,8.64,2.0,"This company has like drinks and nibbles, you know, so they have even alcoholic drinks that the company provides like at, you know, five, 4:00 on Friday afternoon or something."
35192,PS5,3,409.56,411.84,2.28,2.0,So I think weekly could be possible.
35192,PS5,3,412.2,413.84,1.64,2.0,"Depends on what, what, what it is."
35192,PS5,3,413.84,421.56,7.72,2.0,"Yes, yes, 'cause then, you know, some people might be not available one week, you know?"
35192,PS5,3,422.96,423.08,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS5,3,423.08,427.92,4.84,2.0,"And then if they don't, if they miss it that week, then they have to wait another two weeks or one month, you know."
35192,PS5,3,428.12,434.28,6.16,2.0,"But if you have it week on week, then you, you know, some people come this week, some people come this week, you know, I don't know."
35192,PS5,3,435.76,435.88,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35192,PS5,3,440.0,445.56,5.56,2.0,"But really like, I guess in this project task for us, the budget is not an issue."
35192,PS5,3,445.56,447.12,1.56,2.0,So we can do anything really.
35192,PS5,3,447.28,451.88,4.6,2.0,"It can be every week, it can be whatever like."
35192,PS5,3,452.64,463.4,10.76,3.0,"Like like we can give the coupon, give the employee the coupon."
35192,PS5,3,464.52,465.48,0.96,2.0,Employee of the Week.

35192,PS5,3,476.08,478.4,2.32,2.0,"But in the end, people do like to be recognized."
35192,PS5,3,479.0,479.48,0.48,2.0,Oh yeah.
35192,PS5,3,479.48,485.48,6.0,2.0,"Even if they're not financially rewarded, like, you know, like a, you know, like a 20 LB voucher for this every week."
35192,PS5,3,485.76,498.4,12.64,2.0,"Like, even if it's just, you know, verbal recognition or something, you know, people, people, some people might appreciate that, you know, like they, they know that they're appreciated at work, you know?"
35192,PS5,3,498.88,499.8,0.92,3.0,"Yes, I agree."
35192,PS5,3,500.2,500.32,0.12,3.0,Yes.

35192,PS5,3,543.44,549.0,5.56,3.0,"Yeah, and I think it's almost necessary for every workplace."

35192,PS5,3,554.68,557.8,3.12,1.0,"So that's that's another idea, I think."

35592,PS1,6,1.48,4.48,3.0,1.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of our life and.
35592,PS1,6,5.8,6.52,0.72,2.0,Creative idea.
35592,PS1,6,17.76,29.52,11.76,2.0,"Well, I could think of like common things that we use that are plastic that we could replace with something else or somehow not need to use them anymore."
35592,PS1,6,30.2,34.16,3.96,2.0,"Like sort of like the plastic bag, plastic straw thing, something similar to that."
35592,PS1,6,35.36,49.32,13.96,3.0,"I think packaging is a huge thing because for example, in UK supermarkets, they package cucumbers just because, just so they can cure the barcode on it."
35592,PS1,6,49.32,52.72,3.4,3.0,"You can scan it and I'm like, you know, it's just a cucumber, right?"
35592,PS1,6,52.72,53.2,0.48,3.0,You can just.
35592,PS1,6,53.4,53.52,0.12,2.0,I.
35592,PS1,6,53.68,58.36,4.68,3.0,Can just buy it without the packaging and I end up like and I'm throwing the plastic away.
35592,PS1,6,58.36,58.6,0.24,3.0,You don't.
35592,PS1,6,58.64,59.64,1.0,2.0,Even need bar codes as well.
35592,PS1,6,59.84,61.2,1.36,2.0,"You don't have like, Wayne's codes, The package."
35592,PS1,6,62.4,63.48,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's plastic."
35592,PS1,6,63.84,65.16,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, plastic, yeah, like."
35592,PS1,6,66.08,72.16,6.08,3.0,"Plastic, Yeah, yeah, it's basically a nylon thingy around the cucumber just so you can have the bar code."
35592,PS1,6,72.16,79.32,7.16,3.0,"And I was like, you can like either weigh them or I can, I can pay them like per cucumber."
35592,PS1,6,79.76,79.88,0.12,2.0,Like.
35592,PS1,6,79.96,80.28,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, like."
35592,PS1,6,80.6,81.8,1.2,3.0,20P or something?
35592,PS1,6,83.36,85.96,2.6,3.0,"So just like monetary punishments, right?"
35592,PS1,6,87.0,88.28,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, you could do."
35592,PS1,6,88.72,90.4,1.68,3.0,But is that creative just?
35592,PS1,6,91.36,93.6,2.24,2.0,"Yeah, that's what we were struggling with today."
35592,PS1,6,93.84,94.84,1.0,4.0,It has to be creative.
35592,PS1,6,94.88,95.36,0.48,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35592,PS1,6,96.76,97.08,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35592,PS1,6,97.32,102.32,5.0,2.0,"It's not necessarily like the sensible idea, it's just like what is creative?"
35592,PS1,6,103.12,107.96,4.84,5.0,"Yeah, I don't know if I may just give a hint about this plastic waste."
35592,PS1,6,108.28,110.6,2.32,5.0,I did something on it one time.
35592,PS1,6,111.56,113.72,2.16,5.0,So I'm from Africa.
35592,PS1,6,113.72,121.52,7.8,5.0,"So the way we use plastic is unlike here, like you go to the seashore, you see a lot of plastics."
35592,PS1,6,122.12,127.32,5.2,5.0,We decided to start collecting them and recycle them into building materials.
35592,PS1,6,128.88,131.24,2.36,5.0,So that way we able to call.
35592,PS1,6,131.48,136.32,4.84,5.0,"However, my notion to plastic is we should just stop it at all."
35592,PS1,6,137.72,139.2,1.48,5.0,The production has to stop plastic.
35592,PS1,6,140.4,140.56,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35592,PS1,6,141.72,148.84,7.12,5.0,"There are other ways, sustainable ways, but people are not exploring the sustainable way so."
35592,PS1,6,149.96,150.72,0.76,2.0,How would you do that?
35592,PS1,6,150.72,152.76,2.04,2.0,Like without causing chaos?
35592,PS1,6,153.32,155.04,1.72,2.0,Like how would you like sort of?
35592,PS1,6,155.04,157.48,2.44,5.0,Stop stopping the plastic.
35592,PS1,6,157.52,157.88,0.36,5.0,Yeah.
35592,PS1,6,158.08,160.4,2.32,5.0,But that chaos I think is is a policy.
35592,PS1,6,160.76,164.16,3.4,2.0,"But like you'd have to like sort of transition to using other stuff, so like not."
35592,PS1,6,164.64,164.8,0.16,5.0,Really.
35592,PS1,6,164.96,167.32,2.36,5.0,Because I think we have oceans around the world.
35592,PS1,6,168.08,177.88,9.8,5.0,"So studies, not even studies people have implemented whether you see it, yeah, muscle, yeah, muscle, yeah, to provide plastic."
35592,PS1,6,179.0,180.48,1.48,5.0,And these are sustainable materials.
35592,PS1,6,180.88,183.08,2.2,2.0,But much more expensive like.
35592,PS1,6,184.08,186.0,1.92,5.0,I think production of plastic is quite.
35592,PS1,6,186.0,186.68,0.68,3.0,Expensive too.
35592,PS1,6,187.2,187.84,0.64,5.0,"OK, you have to have the."
35592,PS1,6,187.88,189.28,1.4,2.0,Machines and all that's creative.
35592,PS1,6,189.28,189.68,0.4,3.0,However.
35592,PS1,6,190.0,191.0,1.0,5.0,That's by the way.
35592,PS1,6,191.64,193.4,1.76,2.0,"No, no, that's that's not what I do."
35592,PS1,6,193.4,196.72,3.32,5.0,"Yeah, but the creative way now to reduce it, it is happening."
35592,PS1,6,196.72,197.64,0.92,5.0,People don't want to stop.
35592,PS1,6,198.24,199.44,1.2,5.0,So how do we copy it?
35592,PS1,6,200.88,210.56,9.68,3.0,"I mean, you could they give incentives to plastic making companies to change to sustainable waste."
35592,PS1,6,210.56,212.8,2.24,3.0,So maybe like the chaos.
35592,PS1,6,212.8,216.48,3.68,3.0,Will be a bit limited so you you don't close them down.
35592,PS1,6,216.48,216.76,0.28,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35592,PS1,6,216.96,219.6,2.64,2.0,"You just transfer it, but you give them incentives to transition."
35592,PS1,6,219.6,220.4,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, that'll be fine."
35592,PS1,6,221.16,221.88,0.72,3.0,So maybe.
35592,PS1,6,222.4,224.24,1.84,2.0,What sort of what sort of incentives?
35592,PS1,6,225.44,229.12,3.68,3.0,"I mean, first of all, you'll have to present them with an alternative."
35592,PS1,6,229.12,241.44,12.32,3.0,"So maybe research on more sustainable ways, like funding research on more sustainable ways in a way that can be used later."
35592,PS1,6,243.32,245.4,2.08,3.0,So more like practical research.
35592,PS1,6,245.68,258.6,12.92,3.0,"Not only I mean both, you would need both and like semi semi fund the transition maybe or like would use tax on."
35592,PS1,6,259.92,260.28,0.36,5.0,That.
35592,PS1,6,260.32,262.64,2.32,3.0,Would do the transition.
35592,PS1,6,263.12,263.28,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35592,PS1,6,267.72,268.2,0.48,6.0,What do you think?
35592,PS1,6,268.24,270.12,1.88,6.0,I was thinking of the same actually.
35592,PS1,6,270.12,295.64,25.52,6.0,"Like I think for an extended period of time, maybe 5 to 10 years, we could have like more funding for sustainable alternatives so that more companies and more researchers are on the on board the idea and they can be higher economies of scale, like when more companies work together on a product and possibly reduce the cost of the material after a while."
35592,PS1,6,297.08,297.56,0.48,2.0,Should we go with?
35592,PS1,6,297.92,299.6,1.68,4.0,"Yeah, I think we all agree with the farming."
35592,PS1,6,300.72,301.16,0.44,2.0,Part SO.
35592,PS1,6,322.84,323.36,0.52,2.0,Anything else?
35592,PS1,6,326.28,326.8,0.52,2.0,Yeah.
35592,PS1,6,327.36,327.92,0.56,2.0,Is that it?
35592,PS1,6,328.16,328.32,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35592,PS1,6,328.44,333.12,4.68,2.0,Cool to switch over to from plastic.
35592,PS1,6,333.12,340.6,7.48,2.0,Plastic to recycling to Yeah to stay.
35773,PS1,3,0.48,2.84,2.36,1.0,"I will be terrible at typing, so if you want to do the typing."
35773,PS1,3,2.88,4.4,1.52,2.0,"OK, I."
35773,PS1,3,4.52,5.8,1.28,3.0,Don't mind my it's terrible.
35773,PS1,3,6.68,6.92,0.24,2.0,T.
35773,PS1,3,7.44,9.6,2.16,1.0,Rex Mine's very terse sentence.
35773,PS1,3,10.68,11.2,0.52,3.0,Plastic race.
35773,PS1,3,11.2,12.44,1.24,3.0,It's one of the biggest provincial.
35773,PS1,3,13.72,14.6,0.88,1.0,Ban plastic.
35773,PS1,3,15.24,15.64,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,26.08,31.2,5.12,2.0,Well we are starting to do that aren't we with like carry backs and things costing money.
35773,PS1,3,32.56,42.08,9.52,1.0,"So charge big corporations for using plastic packaging, make it penalise."
35773,PS1,3,42.08,45.4,3.32,2.0,"I can penalise corporations, large corporations, so."
35773,PS1,3,47.96,48.92,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, that's banning, Yeah."
35773,PS1,3,49.68,50.0,0.32,2.0,I'm sorry.
35773,PS1,3,50.2,50.56,0.36,1.0,Banning.
35773,PS1,3,51.72,52.0,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,58.08,59.2,1.12,2.0,Creative ideas.
35773,PS1,3,59.72,62.52,2.8,1.0,"Yeah, I mean, the issue is it's a global."
35773,PS1,3,63.08,63.2,0.12,2.0,It's.
35773,PS1,3,63.2,64.2,1.0,1.0,"A global problem, right?"
35773,PS1,3,64.2,73.56,9.36,1.0,"So, you know, if, say, the EU were to penalize large corporations and then just move all their plastic things elsewhere."
35773,PS1,3,74.6,75.0,0.4,2.0,Yes.
35773,PS1,3,76.72,78.52,1.8,1.0,Which means to the next step is what already happens.
35773,PS1,3,79.08,83.52,4.44,1.0,"Plastic waste goes to, you know, places in South Asia."
35773,PS1,3,90.2,99.36,9.16,2.0,"So we need to incentivize rather than punishing, we need to incentivize people to use other things."
35773,PS1,3,117.68,121.12,3.44,2.0,To use to reduce plastic pollution.
35773,PS1,3,121.72,129.76,8.04,2.0,"So maybe it's easy, maybe make it easier for people to put things in to recycling straight away."
35773,PS1,3,130.16,135.08,4.92,1.0,"Yeah, maybe everyone could have bins."
35773,PS1,3,136.4,144.36,7.96,1.0,"I was going to come up and say you could be rewarded for the amount of your waste that you recycle for them, but it's."
35773,PS1,3,145.6,148.64,3.04,2.0,"But it's supposed, well, we're not supposed to work that out."
35773,PS1,3,148.64,151.32,2.68,2.0,We're supposed to come up with a with a creative.
35773,PS1,3,151.32,156.48,5.16,1.0,"Object bins that weigh what you put in there, but then you just put something really heavy into the recycle."
35773,PS1,3,172.26,172.7,0.44,3.0,One picked up.
35773,PS1,3,172.7,178.68,5.98,3.0,"But you already said you talked about like a bean, a bean that people put stuff in and then they get rewarded."
35773,PS1,3,178.88,179.76,0.88,3.0,Kind of like the German.
35773,PS1,3,179.76,182.4,2.64,3.0,"The, the, the German, the, the fan system, right?"
35773,PS1,3,182.4,182.52,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,184.56,184.8,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,189.12,191.08,1.96,1.0,I tried to introduce something like that in Scotland.
35773,PS1,3,191.12,197.48,6.36,1.0,I don't know if they did people were very unhappy or the producers bottles were very unhappy.
35773,PS1,3,198.64,198.92,0.28,3.0,Oh.
35773,PS1,3,201.96,202.6,0.64,1.0,For some reason.
35773,PS1,3,234.84,235.0,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,235.0,236.48,1.48,2.0,"When I went to Croatia, they."
35773,PS1,3,235.69,235.81,0.12,2.0,None.
35773,PS1,3,264.44,272.24,7.8,3.0,"I mean, even glass bottles, I think I was at this place like the Curry wasp and then I just gave back the the the glass bottle and then that person gave me back like the change."
35773,PS1,3,274.44,277.88,3.44,1.0,"Maybe again, like a little leaderboard system of quite good for that sort of thing."
35773,PS1,3,278.24,283.48,5.24,1.0,It's like if you're the top recycler in your street or something.
35773,PS1,3,283.64,283.76,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,285.64,305.88,20.24,2.0,"It used to be that like that glass bottles when I was, when I was much younger, you used to get everything in a glass bottle, but you took the glass bottle and as a child you took, you took the glass bottle back round to the corner shop and you got 10 P And I can do that."
35773,PS1,3,306.12,309.28,3.16,2.0,I mean it was 10P10P was worth a lot in those days did.
35773,PS1,3,309.32,309.96,0.64,1.0,It just fade out.
35773,PS1,3,311.24,329.12,17.88,2.0,Or because people stopped using glass bottles because they were too expensive and use plastic bottles because of easier to transport and all the reasons you use plastic bottles but actually used to get money back and it worked perfectly because all the local kids went around collecting people's.
35773,PS1,3,329.48,334.52,5.04,2.0,As she's saying it's a sub economy that no one actually policed in those days.
35773,PS1,3,334.8,337.2,2.4,2.0,Just said do you want your bottles taken back to shop missus?
35773,PS1,3,337.6,339.36,1.76,2.0,Yep there you go.
35773,PS1,3,340.92,343.32,2.4,2.0,Because they didn't want to dispose of them and you got tempered.
35773,PS1,3,363.71,369.51,5.8,2.0,And can couldn't you positively promote the use of glass bottles by that something?
35773,PS1,3,370.15,380.63,10.48,2.0,Can you say here's your bottle of Coke in a plastic bottle and that costs £1.50 and a bottle of Coke in a glass bottle costs £1.50 as well?
35773,PS1,3,380.83,386.96,6.13,2.0,But you get 20 P back if you take the bottle back and people might then choose cars.
35773,PS1,3,387.52,400.13,12.61,1.0,Because I guess it would be like a implicit tax on plastic in a world where you track what everyone buys all the time.
35773,PS1,3,400.45,412.08,11.63,1.0,"So maybe each time you buy a plastic something in plastic packaging, then incrementally you have to pay more each time you do if."
35773,PS1,3,412.08,412.44,0.36,2.0,You buy.
35773,PS1,3,412.76,417.44,4.68,1.0,If you buy 1 water bottle and it's in plastic then you reuse it and it's fine.
35773,PS1,3,417.64,426.4,8.76,1.0,"The next time you go and buy a water bottle that's plastic, a single use one, then it's like 5% and 10% you get it."
35773,PS1,3,427.6,431.92,4.32,2.0,"Yeah, shame buying."
35773,PS1,3,432.2,436.4,4.2,1.0,"Yeah, I mean, you know, if you're, if you want to pay three times the price, you're water fine."
35773,PS1,3,437.68,444.48,6.8,1.0,"Otherwise, you know, we use a bottle or something and we may be fantastic water bottles."
35773,PS1,3,444.48,453.68,9.2,1.0,"If you don't want to forget your bottle, then, oh, now I've got to pay extra."
35773,PS1,3,454.04,454.64,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, once."
35773,PS1,3,455.04,455.48,0.44,1.0,That's right.
35773,PS1,3,456.52,459.04,2.52,1.0,"But if it's a habit, I'll get punished."
35773,PS1,3,516.47,526.35,9.88,2.0,"Or water fountains, which happens in a lot of other European countries, not in this country."
35773,PS1,3,527.24,531.8,4.56,3.0,But here you get there's like a an app where you can find out where you can fill your bottles in the cafes.
35773,PS1,3,531.8,536.28,4.48,3.0,"I haven't used that because I would be afraid to walk in and ask, but I think there's something like that."
35773,PS1,3,536.28,536.32,0.04,3.0,I.
35773,PS1,3,536.8,541.76,4.96,2.0,"Don't know about DC, I don't know about that, but public water fountains, people might use them."
35773,PS1,3,542.44,550.52,8.08,1.0,"Yeah, I really need to commence it into one paper."
35773,PS1,3,551.72,552.12,0.4,3.0,I know.
35773,PS1,3,575.44,580.28,4.84,1.0,"So I guess we just keep it in the middle, trim the first and last sentences."
35773,PS1,3,582.6,582.8,0.2,3.0,Right.
35773,PS1,3,583.0,584.44,1.44,3.0,Do we get rid of the bottom fountain?
35773,PS1,3,587.48,588.4,0.92,1.0,So we have one idea.
35773,PS1,3,591.08,592.72,1.64,3.0,"Wait, where's the first?"
35773,PS1,3,592.8,594.32,1.52,3.0,What's the end of the first sentence?
35773,PS1,3,594.76,606.12,11.36,1.0,"Well, I guess we just said if we have the recycling scheme that one you could take the use the revenue bit, put that somewhere else if you want to go."
35773,PS1,3,607.36,618.16,10.8,2.0,So people is PEOPM right and plastic on the worst and since it's plastic.
35773,PS1,3,627.49,627.73,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35773,PS1,3,630.33,630.97,0.64,2.0,I think that'll do.
36473,PS6,3,0.88,6.64,5.76,1.0,Imagine a new research study discovered that singing in the shower for 20 minutes or more is good for health.
36473,PS6,3,6.92,9.6,2.68,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
36473,PS6,3,11.08,11.24,0.16,2.0,Shower.
36473,PS6,3,12.44,12.92,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
36473,PS6,3,13.36,16.88,3.52,1.0,Imagine a new research that says when you sing in the shower is good for your health.
36473,PS6,3,17.56,20.56,3.0,1.0,Come up with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
36473,PS6,3,22.52,23.44,0.92,2.0,Makes them feel happy.
36473,PS6,3,24.56,25.36,0.8,1.0,"No, no, no, they say."
36473,PS6,3,25.36,28.28,2.92,1.0,Come up with an idea that will meet people just the the can.
36473,PS6,3,29.76,34.64,4.88,3.0,You have a new in buildings where showers have something to play music.
36473,PS6,3,35.08,38.52,3.44,1.0,OK inbuilds.
36473,PS6,3,39.44,48.56,9.12,1.0,"Inbuilds music in showers shower rooms, not showers you."
36473,PS6,3,49.08,49.64,0.56,3.0,Know shower.
36473,PS6,3,50.4,50.56,0.16,1.0,Shower.
36473,PS6,3,50.56,50.8,0.24,1.0,Shower.
36473,PS6,3,50.8,56.44,5.64,1.0,"OK, shower in shower rooms and how else?"
36473,PS6,3,58.08,63.88,5.8,1.0,"And with an inscription, turn me on An inscript."
36473,PS6,3,64.92,67.44,2.52,1.0,"But that's not going to OK with an inscription, turn me on."
36473,PS6,3,67.44,69.96,2.52,1.0,"OK, turn me on."
36473,PS6,3,70.6,71.4,0.8,1.0,What else?
36473,PS6,3,75.92,77.6,1.68,1.0,"Oh, this is just one creative idea."
36473,PS6,3,77.92,79.48,1.56,3.0,"OK, one idea is this."
36473,PS6,3,79.92,80.24,0.32,1.0,Enough.
36473,PS6,3,80.24,80.76,0.52,3.0,Is this enough?
36473,PS6,3,81.2,82.48,1.28,1.0,That's the thing we need to check.
36473,PS6,3,82.56,87.4,4.84,1.0,We have 10 minutes to think something else.
36473,PS6,3,87.4,90.2,2.8,1.0,So imagine new research study discovered and singing the showers.
36473,PS6,3,90.68,92.56,1.88,1.0,Just come up with workers and encourage people to do this.
36473,PS6,3,96.64,100.52,3.88,2.0,See come up in with creative idea to encourage people to do this.
36473,PS6,3,100.52,102.76,2.24,2.0,You want me them to do that like once like?
36473,PS6,3,103.64,103.84,0.2,1.0,When?
36473,PS6,3,103.96,104.48,0.52,2.0,I think when?
36473,PS6,3,104.48,104.64,0.16,1.0,They're.
36473,PS6,3,104.64,106.36,1.72,2.0,Showering playmates without showering?
36473,PS6,3,107.64,108.56,0.92,2.0,What could be the idea?
36473,PS6,3,109.52,112.28,2.76,1.0,"That's what we're writing, that's what we just wrote now inbuilt."
36473,PS6,3,112.28,119.08,6.8,1.0,"So if you put music into this thing and then and you have the inscription, turn me on."
36473,PS6,3,119.52,121.68,2.16,1.0,"So when people come in, that's the first thing they're saying."
36473,PS6,3,121.68,124.24,2.56,1.0,So they'll be encouraged to use it another way.
36473,PS6,3,124.24,127.84,3.6,1.0,"But that one is already like use of media, but I don't think how."
36473,PS6,3,128.32,128.44,0.12,3.0,How?
36473,PS6,3,129.4,136.84,7.44,1.0,Use of media so I run adverts for people to tell to publicize the importance of singing and health.
36473,PS6,3,136.84,139.08,2.24,3.0,But I feel this is better because of forgetful.
36473,PS6,3,139.24,140.16,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, exactly in the."
36473,PS6,3,140.4,140.68,0.28,3.0,Media.
36473,PS6,3,140.92,141.96,1.04,1.0,"Should OK, this is."
36473,PS6,3,144.24,145.08,0.84,3.0,Better he's taking nice.

36473,PS6,3,148.72,150.2,1.48,1.0,Is this we have to submit for this one?
36473,PS6,3,150.8,156.36,5.56,1.0,What counts of why is this thing now?
36473,PS6,3,156.4,158.32,1.92,1.0,Is this not caps lock?
36473,PS6,3,158.32,159.48,1.16,1.0,Love to be this one away.
36473,PS6,3,161.12,162.16,1.04,1.0,Are you seeing what I'm saying?
36473,PS6,3,163.12,163.96,0.84,1.0,Like it's not like space.
36473,PS6,3,163.96,168.08,4.12,3.0,Give space and see what happens.
36473,PS6,3,168.08,168.28,0.2,3.0,I still.
36473,PS6,3,168.36,170.24,1.88,1.0,"Like that, you know they are no English people."
36473,PS6,3,170.24,170.32,0.08,1.0,I'm.
36473,PS6,3,170.6,173.16,2.56,3.0,"Finished, finished that maybe to change even this one did not."
36473,PS6,3,173.32,173.48,0.16,1.0,Change.
36473,PS6,3,173.68,183.92,10.24,1.0,"Yeah, this is effective as it's a good as"
36473,PS6,3,184.84,185.84,1.0,3.0,Time is going.
36473,PS6,3,186.2,188.32,2.12,1.0,No this 12 minutes for this question.
34348,PS2,3,0.0,598.76,6.92,3.0,I see vulnerability within the supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedule.
34348,PS2,3,599.72,601.68,1.96,3.0,"OK, come up with one creative idea."
34348,PS2,3,603.32,605.56,2.24,1.0,That's so vague vulnerabilities.
34348,PS2,3,606.44,607.48,1.04,2.0,What do you want to say to talk about?
34348,PS2,3,607.68,611.24,3.56,3.0,"For example, Sigma, now I I did you take the supply chain class?"
34348,PS2,3,611.28,611.56,0.28,3.0,I did.
34348,PS2,3,611.56,612.16,0.6,3.0,Are you?
34348,PS2,3,612.56,615.4,2.84,3.0,"Yeah, some will be proud of us."
34348,PS2,3,615.4,618.12,2.72,3.0,I did uncontrolled costs in in.
34348,PS2,3,618.72,620.6,1.88,3.0,"OK, but this one's very specific."
34348,PS2,3,620.64,623.2,2.56,3.0,Uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery.
34348,PS2,3,623.2,623.64,0.44,3.0,Sure.
34348,PS2,3,623.96,627.0,3.04,3.0,So the vulnerability has to be like whatever contributes to that.
34348,PS2,3,630.0,631.6,1.6,3.0,What are the vulnerabilities?
34348,PS2,3,632.36,633.2,0.84,3.0,That's my question.
34348,PS2,3,635.52,635.8,0.28,1.0,Are you?
34348,PS2,3,638.96,640.52,1.56,3.0,What is the affordability?
34348,PS2,3,640.96,642.44,1.48,1.0,"OK, let's let's take a product."
34348,PS2,3,642.44,643.48,1.04,1.0,Let's pretend as a product.
34348,PS2,3,643.52,643.8,0.28,1.0,Let's look.
34348,PS2,3,643.8,644.04,0.24,1.0,I mean it.
34348,PS2,3,644.04,651.76,7.72,2.0,"Could be like suppliers, right, like supplier or what's happening right now is trade wars or trade tension."
34348,PS2,3,651.76,654.6,2.84,2.0,"So you're not be you're not able to supply raw material, right?"
34348,PS2,3,654.6,662.76,8.16,2.0,"So that leads to increased cost because you're not getting your metal and chips that you need to get from China and you're not able to make the product out of it, OK."
34348,PS2,3,664.08,664.84,0.76,1.0,So materials.
34348,PS2,3,665.4,667.92,2.52,2.0,Material is your 1 labour shortage.
34348,PS2,3,668.04,668.48,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS2,3,669.64,670.48,0.84,1.0,"Oh, chocolate."
34348,PS2,3,671.0,673.48,2.48,1.0,"I mean, one of the things they say is like, have everything closer."
34348,PS2,3,673.88,675.12,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, that's what they do in Japan."
34348,PS2,3,675.24,675.6,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, have."
34348,PS2,3,676.2,678.84,2.64,1.0,Everything closer to your warehouse.
34348,PS2,3,680.8,687.92,7.12,1.0,Another thing is we revert back to a time when we didn't need these things.
34348,PS2,3,687.92,688.24,0.32,1.0,I love that.
34348,PS2,3,689.52,689.92,0.4,1.0,I love that.
34348,PS2,3,690.76,691.96,1.2,3.0,I love that I love that these.
34348,PS2,3,692.48,696.08,3.6,2.0,"Things that anything that's walk, that tackles the technology."
34348,PS2,3,697.52,698.44,0.92,3.0,'Cause there's none.
34348,PS2,3,698.76,702.72,3.96,1.0,"There's nothing, you know, go out, cloud a tree."
34348,PS2,3,702.92,704.28,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, make a home there."
34348,PS2,3,704.32,707.2,2.88,3.0,"And then like plan your own, like vegetables, yes."
34348,PS2,3,707.76,719.44,11.68,1.0,"Go, If we had a more, if we had a greater, like borrowing or bartering system, we would need to buy less, you know?"
34348,PS2,3,721.72,723.6,1.88,3.0,Basically decrease domestic.
34348,PS2,3,725.32,728.04,2.72,1.0,"Yeah, back to barter system, back to."
34348,PS2,3,729.04,730.92,1.88,2.0,That's that's the greatest will trade you.
34348,PS2,3,732.64,733.84,1.2,1.0,This pair of shoes.

34348,PS2,3,742.08,744.96,2.88,3.0,"Yeah, how creative do we want to go?"
34348,PS2,3,744.96,746.16,1.2,3.0,I'm here to create a solution it.
34348,PS2,3,747.12,748.72,1.6,2.0,"Doesn't have to be, they're trying to."
34348,PS2,3,749.44,749.92,0.48,3.0,"Yeah, they know."

34348,PS2,3,764.76,768.52,3.76,1.0,"It uncontrolled costs, inefficient delivery schedules."
34348,PS2,3,768.64,771.48,2.84,1.0,Please come along here to tackle supply chain security.
34348,PS2,3,773.48,774.92,1.44,3.0,This is a really technical one.
34348,PS2,3,774.92,776.0,1.08,3.0,We need Sun Q here.
34348,PS2,3,776.16,778.24,2.08,3.0,I know someone who worked in supply chain.
34348,PS2,3,780.16,783.72,3.56,3.0,I think this one we cannot beat the AI is are they trying to prove a point?
34348,PS2,3,783.72,786.8,3.08,3.0,"If it's something that like that is of high level of yeah, I think."
34348,PS2,3,788.32,788.64,0.32,1.0,I think.
34348,PS2,3,788.72,789.4,0.68,2.0,The bottom system.
34348,PS2,3,789.4,789.76,0.36,1.0,Works.
34348,PS2,3,790.12,790.76,0.64,1.0,It's all yeah.

36255,PS4,3,59.84,77.84,18.0,2.0,"Yeah, to those with less access to educational resources, probably we can like make a like a like AI teacher so that you can, everyone can get access to education."

36255,PS4,3,132.76,137.56,4.8,1.0,"I mean, I I know there is AAI, but I don't want to learn skills."
36255,PS4,3,138.4,147.92,9.52,1.0,"I guess maybe we can provide some motivation for this group to, you know, be ambitious."
36255,PS4,3,151.36,159.28,7.92,3.0,If I don't know motivation I saying like rewarding them if they actually learn.

36255,PS4,3,206.4,206.8,0.4,2.0,Is it?
36255,PS4,3,208.4,211.24,2.84,2.0,I think that's the kind of the idea.
36255,PS4,3,212.2,212.6,0.4,1.0,You can.
36255,PS4,3,213.56,215.96,2.4,2.0,You don't get access to education.
36255,PS4,3,215.96,221.48,5.52,2.0,You can learn on your job to get skills.
36255,PS4,3,222.04,229.8,7.76,1.0,"I, I, I get, yeah, you, you don't have to be knowledge before you get into the job."

36255,PS4,3,284.33,295.8,11.47,1.0,"We're just talking about AI, but if some disadvantaged people didn't have computer or or smartphone, they they cannot access to AI so."
36255,PS4,3,296.64,297.96,1.32,3.0,"Those are my people, too."
36255,PS4,3,298.56,302.88,4.32,1.0,"Yeah, I mean you have a laptop is you are, you are not disadvantaged people."
36255,PS4,3,310.32,311.8,1.48,1.0,I think your idea is good.
36255,PS4,3,312.6,332.32,19.72,1.0,"I mean, people don't need to be acknowledged before they I mean they don't need to be selecting, they just accepting and then we coach them too to be a skilful employee or or workforce somehow."
36255,PS4,3,333.2,341.16,7.96,1.0,"Yeah, it's difficult to change the in inequality."
36255,PS4,3,356.44,366.48,10.04,3.0,"I think we can note that down soon because it shouldn't be something that is like for real, like achievable at the moment."
36255,PS4,3,367.2,373.84,6.64,3.0,"It's like if we drop the idea now, they might have their own view of right."
36255,PS4,3,374.04,379.12,5.08,3.0,"Maybe we are thinking that, oh, this time it's my actually no work, it's my work, it's my know."
36255,PS4,3,379.12,385.44,6.32,3.0,"But when they assess it, they might actually find it useful than the way we are trying to thinking of it."
36255,PS4,3,385.44,389.28,3.84,3.0,"So I think your plan, your idea is OK."
36255,PS4,3,389.36,389.96,0.6,3.0,It's fine.
36255,PS4,3,390.12,390.24,0.12,3.0,Yeah.

36255,PS4,3,407.56,418.12,10.56,3.0,"And once employed, then you don't need, you don't have to employ them based on their or maybe education certification or qualification."
36255,PS4,3,418.28,418.64,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
36255,PS4,3,418.76,419.0,0.24,1.0,So.
36255,PS4,3,419.4,420.88,1.48,3.0,You train them on the job.
36255,PS4,3,422.4,425.08,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, set up."
36255,PS4,3,427.12,441.36,14.24,2.0,Certain like special recruitment programs to help these to to help people from these.
36255,PS4,3,442.48,443.16,0.68,3.0,Groups.
36255,PS4,3,443.92,452.8,8.88,2.0,To get trained for jobs.
36255,PS4,3,463.06,472.44,9.38,1.0,Which means they only compete with people also from disadvantage also from this group.
36255,PS4,3,472.44,475.4,2.96,1.0,They're not competing with people outside this group.
36255,PS4,3,476.48,489.92,13.44,2.0,That are targeted at people from from these groups.

36255,PS4,3,524.08,524.64,0.56,1.0,Move to.
35758,PS3,3,0.04,1.32,1.28,1.0,"Well, how many questions do we have?"
35758,PS3,3,2.56,4.2,1.64,1.0,Imagine a new pandemic.
35758,PS3,3,4.2,9.28,5.08,1.0,"Oh good Lord, has it emerged that is transmitted by saying the word sorry."
35758,PS3,3,12.24,18.04,5.8,1.0,"Oh my God, Canada is going to be consumed."
35758,PS3,3,18.44,25.68,7.24,1.0,"All right, Why so everybody become cocky?"
35758,PS3,3,26.24,27.52,1.28,2.0,Just speak another language.
35758,PS3,3,29.32,29.6,0.28,2.0,Oh.
35758,PS3,3,30.24,31.6,1.36,1.0,"OK, OK, good speaking."
35758,PS3,3,31.8,36.32,4.52,1.0,"OK, do we create a word to replace it or just like Oh yeah."
35758,PS3,3,36.32,36.76,0.44,2.0,That works.
35758,PS3,3,36.76,37.2,0.44,2.0,That works.
35758,PS3,3,37.6,38.44,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, just say cheers."
35758,PS3,3,39.84,41.92,2.08,1.0,"Oh man, United Kingdom's going to fall."
35758,PS3,3,42.36,43.08,0.72,1.0,We can.
35758,PS3,3,44.0,47.56,3.56,1.0,We can create a new word.
35758,PS3,3,48.8,50.68,1.88,2.0,Just replace the phrase like my.
35758,PS3,3,51.92,53.96,2.04,1.0,Dad or what's that?
35758,PS3,3,53.96,56.48,2.52,1.0,"Oh, wait, OK, then should we go?"
35758,PS3,3,56.48,64.92,8.44,1.0,"Like we can be like we can issue a ban on the word sorry, like we can issue a government."
35758,PS3,3,66.36,67.56,1.2,2.0,Still the big processes.
35758,PS3,3,69.64,70.32,0.68,1.0,"No, I'm sorry."
35758,PS3,3,70.32,71.16,0.84,1.0,"You guys go, You guys go."
35758,PS3,3,75.76,81.44,5.68,1.0,"Because we have to, because the whole study is supposed to pitch us against AI."
35758,PS3,3,81.48,86.4,4.92,1.0,"So if AI is given a prompt to be created, we have to counter that."
35758,PS3,3,86.72,91.64,4.92,1.0,"And I need to stop drawing from existing sources, because if I can do that, they can do that too, yeah."
35758,PS3,3,92.04,92.36,0.32,2.0,Of course.
35758,PS3,3,92.56,92.68,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35758,PS3,3,92.68,95.72,3.04,2.0,"Yeah, we need to use our human imagination."
35758,PS3,3,101.4,111.2,9.8,3.0,Those dialects can't if they just change the dialects the same word like Sorry to sorry I was just making.
35758,PS3,3,113.16,114.04,0.88,2.0,Do you think that works?
35758,PS3,3,115.04,117.68,2.64,2.0,You will ask AI can you identify a story?
35758,PS3,3,118.08,123.64,5.56,2.0,I I believe AI will say yes because they they need to identify all the words.
35758,PS3,3,124.48,129.52,5.04,3.0,"And also they can change all the dictionaries, the pronunciations, all the dictionaries at the same time."
35758,PS3,3,129.6,132.16,2.56,3.0,So people believe that that's the correct pronunciation.
35758,PS3,3,133.48,136.4,2.92,3.0,"Oh, this pronunciation has evolved a lot throughout the past years, right?"
35758,PS3,3,136.4,136.72,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35758,PS3,3,136.88,137.24,0.36,3.0,Sorry.
35758,PS3,3,137.44,138.68,1.24,3.0,"The word sorry, it wasn't pronounced."
35758,PS3,3,138.68,139.12,0.44,3.0,Sorry.
35758,PS3,3,139.16,139.48,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35758,PS3,3,139.64,143.12,3.48,3.0,"Nowadays, but probably before it was called sokhi."
35758,PS3,3,144.8,146.92,2.12,3.0,"I mean, the French pronouns are in terms of age, right?"
35758,PS3,3,147.24,147.68,0.44,1.0,Really.
35758,PS3,3,147.68,150.24,2.56,1.0,"Yeah, but sorry in French is not similar."
35758,PS3,3,150.4,152.12,1.72,3.0,"I know, but I was just making the point."
35758,PS3,3,152.12,157.2,5.08,3.0,So they just change the pronunciation instead of changing the word and they recognise that.
35758,PS3,3,157.2,157.68,0.48,3.0,Sorry.
35758,PS3,3,158.08,158.28,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35758,PS3,3,158.6,161.64,3.04,2.0,"And you can use Russian, like use your tongue."
35758,PS3,3,162.2,163.2,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, I don't know."
35758,PS3,3,164.08,164.6,0.52,2.0,I don't know.
35758,PS3,3,165.68,166.36,0.68,3.0,But that's a can't.
35758,PS3,3,167.92,168.44,0.52,1.0,"Well, I can."
35758,PS3,3,169.08,174.76,5.68,1.0,Another way of thinking is that we eliminate the reason to feel sorry so that people won't say it.
35758,PS3,3,175.6,182.36,6.76,1.0,"You know, so one of the solution can be like start being cocky, you know, start being asshole start for anything."
35758,PS3,3,182.44,182.6,0.16,2.0,Here.
35758,PS3,3,182.6,183.04,0.44,2.0,OK.
35758,PS3,3,183.08,185.6,2.52,2.0,"Yeah, that makes sense."
35758,PS3,3,191.2,203.68,12.48,1.0,"We can also foster for extreme cases, he says."
35758,PS3,3,203.92,221.28,17.36,1.0,We can foster an an Iron Man that eliminates the behaviour if you sorry and empathize.
35758,PS3,3,221.6,223.84,2.24,3.0,"The answer contains the word sorry, so you're infected."
35758,PS3,3,224.8,228.64,3.84,1.0,"No, I'm saying I'm proposing empathize."
35758,PS3,3,229.52,229.68,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
35758,PS3,3,230.48,230.6,0.12,2.0,With.
35758,PS3,3,233.88,240.24,6.36,1.0,"Others OK, so so."
35758,PS3,3,244.2,249.2,5.0,3.0,"Everyone can defend themselves saying that my story was the ones dealt with SORY, not SORRY."
35758,PS3,3,251.6,254.48,2.88,1.0,"OK, I can't have anything to add."
35758,PS3,3,255.56,257.04,1.48,3.0,Probably the first one includes.
35758,PS3,3,257.36,257.72,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35758,PS3,3,258.24,259.36,1.12,3.0,"Yeah, my idea as well."
35758,PS3,3,259.36,259.64,0.28,3.0,So are there?
35758,PS3,3,260.76,261.4,0.64,1.0,Anything else that?
35758,PS3,3,261.72,262.12,0.4,2.0,"No, I'm."
35758,PS3,3,262.72,263.76,1.04,3.0,"Good, I'm good."
35758,PS3,3,263.76,265.92,2.16,3.0,Or another language or pronunciation.
35758,PS3,3,266.12,267.52,1.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, or or dialect."
35758,PS3,3,268.04,268.56,0.52,1.0,Pronunciation.
35758,PS3,3,270.92,271.48,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, that's fine."
35758,PS3,3,273.48,273.88,0.4,3.0,Next.
36105,PS2,6,3.2,8.28,5.08,1.0,Control costs and efficient delivery schedule.
36105,PS2,6,9.28,13.2,3.92,1.0,It's called the creative and the tackle supporting security.
36105,PS2,6,14.08,20.28,6.2,2.0,This is my entire degree so I should be able to industrial systems and management.
36105,PS2,6,30.92,31.84,0.92,3.0,So what are they?
36105,PS2,6,32.96,33.32,0.36,3.0,What?
36105,PS2,6,33.32,34.76,1.44,3.0,What are the vulnerabilities like?
36105,PS2,6,34.76,35.44,0.68,3.0,What kind of things?
36105,PS2,6,39.48,49.6,10.12,2.0,"So like if you, if you're a manufacturer and you have lots of your like raw materials coming from different countries and then there's like a geopolitical thing then that like cuts off your supply chain."
36105,PS2,6,50.0,52.24,2.24,2.0,So most of it is like geopolitical tensions.
36105,PS2,6,52.24,62.48,10.24,2.0,"There's also like if you're shipping over large distances and the weather is rubbish and like you like are evicted into a delay, so like inefficient delivery schedules."
36105,PS2,6,62.64,66.68,4.04,2.0,So the idea is mainly that you try and like centralise everything.
36105,PS2,6,67.44,75.8,8.36,2.0,"So you want your supply chain to be as local as possible, but also to have multiple suppliers rather than being reliant on like one or two suppliers, so."
36105,PS2,6,82.36,82.68,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36105,PS2,6,83.12,85.32,2.2,3.0,So how many multiple suppliers have?
36105,PS2,6,85.8,87.08,1.28,2.0,That's not very creative though.
36105,PS2,6,87.08,88.48,1.4,2.0,I don't know what they want for.
36105,PS2,6,88.48,95.44,6.96,1.0,"The things on on the means of supply chain like the means transport, transport, transportation is the air 0 St."
36105,PS2,6,95.44,97.08,1.64,1.0,like Rd.
36105,PS2,6,98.0,99.52,1.52,1.0,Those kind of things are different.
36105,PS2,6,99.52,99.72,0.2,1.0,It could.
36105,PS2,6,100.2,100.96,0.76,3.0,Be storage.
36105,PS2,6,102.12,103.08,0.96,4.0,"Yeah, inventory."
36105,PS2,6,103.52,103.8,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36105,PS2,6,104.16,105.6,1.44,3.0,Does it stay for too long?
36105,PS2,6,105.76,106.24,0.48,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS2,6,106.36,110.8,4.44,3.0,So if you stay for too long it could cause a problem and that can also affect cause.
36105,PS2,6,115.32,120.6,5.28,1.0,Probably maybe I can fit setting up like facilities that basically only for transportation.
36105,PS2,6,120.6,125.28,4.68,1.0,So I mean like like a rail station would be only for transportation and more human cargo.
36105,PS2,6,125.28,129.28,4.0,1.0,Just it goes like maybe straight into like neighboring.
36105,PS2,6,129.88,133.04,3.16,2.0,That would still be backed into like weather and things like that though.
36105,PS2,6,135.12,144.68,9.56,1.0,"It it could be, maybe it could be like a freezer for coaching and then maybe feeds resistance food was, you know, perishable."
36105,PS2,6,146.0,146.36,0.36,3.0,What?
36105,PS2,6,146.36,146.64,0.28,3.0,Where?
36105,PS2,6,146.68,147.68,1.0,3.0,Where's the costs?
36105,PS2,6,147.8,148.44,0.64,3.0,"Yeah, controlled."
36105,PS2,6,148.44,149.36,0.92,2.0,Costs come from.
36105,PS2,6,150.36,155.72,5.36,1.0,"Control costs because if your goods boy, it adds to the cost of goods."
36105,PS2,6,156.32,156.68,0.36,1.0,It could.
36105,PS2,6,156.84,157.52,0.68,1.0,"If it's perishable, I."
36105,PS2,6,157.52,170.52,13.0,2.0,"Think it's also like say if your like main supplier can't supply to you like it's or like say if you're an oil company and you get your oil from Russia and then like you have the geopolitical stuff, which means you can't get it from them anymore, but you still have customers that need it."
36105,PS2,6,170.56,174.08,3.52,2.0,You then have to pay like a premium to get it from someone else.
36105,PS2,6,174.12,175.48,1.36,2.0,So that's an uncontrolled cost.
36105,PS2,6,175.56,175.84,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS2,6,177.36,177.88,0.52,2.0,So basically.
36105,PS2,6,177.96,197.44,19.48,4.0,"Can we can we say probably having a, having a particular supplier with whom you enter into a contingency contract very specifically where you contract with him and you tell him that I will buy from you only if ABCD there are like 3 or 4 events which happen."
36105,PS2,6,198.0,205.24,7.24,4.0,"Let's say my main supplier is not able to supply, there's an earthquake or whatever event etcetera, etcetera."
36105,PS2,6,206.84,215.36,8.52,4.0,"How practical it is is a different issue, but but it's a it's a backup solution."
36105,PS2,6,216.04,217.32,1.28,4.0,Is not your primary supplier.
36105,PS2,6,217.76,222.76,5.0,1.0,"OK, the problem is not how do you get your goods start really having to pay."
36105,PS2,6,225.64,230.36,4.72,4.0,So that's the reason you're doing a contract with him because you are contracting the cost upfront.
36105,PS2,6,231.4,246.36,14.96,4.0,So probably you commit for a certain quantity so that the other person or the supplier has even he he has an interest in entering that contract and you also finalise the price and a minimum quantity and your contract is valid for that much.
36105,PS2,6,246.36,259.08,12.72,4.0,"However, the timing is subject to any, what can you say, contingencies, contingencies that arise and and you have that contract for a particular period of time."
36105,PS2,6,260.4,264.36,3.96,1.0,"OK, well the the contract is going to cost you money."
36105,PS2,6,264.76,266.44,1.68,2.0,And you haven't saved in a long time.
36105,PS2,6,266.76,267.12,0.36,4.0,Yeah.
36105,PS2,6,267.84,277.76,9.92,4.0,"So the example that we just mentioned about the oil supply, so like all of a sudden your supply is cut off and then you try to find a supplier, it's going to be much more expensive."
36105,PS2,6,277.76,287.44,9.68,2.0,"Or else you could just say like it links into yours, but just rather than having like one primary supply, like just having multiple like that's the basic way to get security is just having more options."
36105,PS2,6,287.52,287.96,0.44,2.0,So like.
36105,PS2,6,289.44,290.4,0.96,1.0,Multiple options.
36105,PS2,6,290.4,296.16,5.76,2.0,"Then, yeah, So like a reasonable supply chain is where you only have like 1 supplier and one consumer."
36105,PS2,6,296.16,297.72,1.56,2.0,So you're just wanting to broaden that out.
36105,PS2,6,297.72,300.56,2.84,2.0,But like contracts I do is good because I'm not saying a guarantee.
36105,PS2,6,302.0,302.12,0.12,1.0,OK.
36105,PS2,6,302.12,308.52,6.4,1.0,And what about government only like supply chain companies themselves like.
36105,PS2,6,308.6,317.4,8.8,1.0,So sometimes most of these things are caused by maybe the cost increase because a particular person is shipping it and you being taxed on shipping but the company for example if the.
36105,PS2,6,317.68,320.44,2.76,5.0,Government is part of the maybe suppliers.
36105,PS2,6,320.68,320.8,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS2,6,321.44,322.04,0.6,5.0,It all the.
36105,PS2,6,322.04,324.84,2.8,6.0,Cost the taxes in the room the tax because already the only.
36105,PS2,6,324.84,326.28,1.44,5.0,Government facilities.
36105,PS2,6,327.52,335.08,7.56,3.0,"But I also think that if the suppliers are many and there always be efficient control of course, because if one fails."
36105,PS2,6,335.88,338.24,2.36,1.0,"That is, or you could do."
36105,PS2,6,338.52,346.28,7.76,3.0,You go the other way and just have a database or a a map of where people have excess supply.
36105,PS2,6,346.92,349.52,2.6,3.0,So then basically they'll be selling it cheaper.
36105,PS2,6,349.88,355.24,5.36,3.0,So then it basically matched a a matching system for supply and demand.
36105,PS2,6,356.0,360.4,4.4,3.0,"So if you have if you need something, you flag it."
36105,PS2,6,360.56,363.96,3.4,4.0,"So a real, a real time exchange, yeah."
36105,PS2,6,364.56,368.0,3.44,3.0,"Which has yeah, because that could let work in this local."
36105,PS2,6,370.28,371.96,1.68,4.0,"OK, so which one do we finalise?"
36105,PS2,6,373.08,374.2,1.12,2.0,"I mean, that's the most creative."
36105,PS2,6,378.68,384.84,6.16,2.0,"And that was a coil, yes, but that's not always going to work like with oil."
36105,PS2,6,384.84,395.32,10.48,2.0,"Like if you have a, if you're an oil producer and you've got loads of oil coming in, you've upped your prices, like, you know, you can like play into that their way as a supplier."
36105,PS2,6,395.44,398.36,2.92,2.0,Like you don't benefit from the fact that you're in a greater position.
36105,PS2,6,398.36,399.48,1.12,2.0,So you can profit from that.
36105,PS2,6,400.52,404.44,3.92,4.0,"Because that that happens like with any market for that, for example."
36105,PS2,6,404.44,405.2,0.76,2.0,And commodity?
36105,PS2,6,405.52,408.72,3.2,4.0,Commodity or even for like stocks or financial securities.
36105,PS2,6,409.24,412.32,3.08,4.0,"If you know something is in demand, the sell sellers will Jack up their prices I guess."
36105,PS2,6,412.68,416.16,3.48,3.0,My point is it's more like the distressed seller perspective.
36105,PS2,6,416.6,421.24,4.64,3.0,"So, so like you want to get rid of this, you're more interested in the cash than that."
36105,PS2,6,421.52,421.96,0.44,2.0,"That's true, yeah."
36105,PS2,6,422.64,423.64,1.0,3.0,So it doesn't I mean we.
36105,PS2,6,423.64,425.96,2.32,2.0,Could just specify what like circumstances for.
36105,PS2,6,426.16,426.92,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, I mean, it doesn't."
36105,PS2,6,426.92,429.72,2.8,3.0,"Yeah, I mean, there's not going to be a solution that suits every situation."
36105,PS2,6,429.88,430.52,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, of course."
36105,PS2,6,431.4,431.96,0.56,4.0,So what?
36105,PS2,6,431.96,433.56,1.6,4.0,What do we finally type now?
36105,PS2,6,433.56,433.72,0.16,4.0,I would.
36105,PS2,6,436.16,437.12,0.96,2.0,Suggest with only one idea.
36105,PS2,6,437.12,437.52,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, just."
36105,PS2,6,437.56,438.04,0.48,4.0,Just one one.
36105,PS2,6,438.04,448.0,9.96,4.0,So do we have to just so either it's either it's the exchange or the the contingency contract that we discuss or anything else?
36105,PS2,6,451.08,452.96,1.88,2.0,I guess we could just.
36105,PS2,6,453.28,454.6,1.32,4.0,Multiple suppliers but.
36105,PS2,6,456.24,463.2,6.96,3.0,"I guess it's still multiple suppliers, it's just more of a it's a communication, it's a communication system really, isn't it?"
36105,PS2,6,463.24,467.32,4.08,3.0,So if one supplier then it has to be totally efficient.
36105,PS2,6,467.8,473.36,5.56,3.0,That's all the systems in place to ensure that you always be adequate suppliers.
36105,PS2,6,475.0,494.64,19.64,4.0,"The only thing I feel with the with the exchange thing is for in it might work within an economy, but if you're talking about international trade, having that information that at any other point of time, one place in the world there's an excess of that commodity and another place there's a deficit, getting that information may not always I."
36105,PS2,6,494.8,501.96,7.16,3.0,Guess maybe just having improved communication channels between international suppliers.
36105,PS2,6,503.2,503.4,0.2,1.0,OK.
36105,PS2,6,503.92,505.88,1.96,4.0,Let's let's finalise only three minutes.
36105,PS2,6,505.88,507.48,1.6,3.0,And then you can have access to more.
36105,PS2,6,507.8,511.8,4.0,3.0,"If it's easy to contact, it's making it easier to contact people basically."
36105,PS2,6,511.8,512.92,1.12,3.0,And then you can negotiate.
36105,PS2,6,514.4,515.16,0.76,4.0,What do we put down do?
36105,PS2,6,516.2,516.96,0.76,2.0,You want to type it up.
36105,PS2,6,518.4,531.44,13.04,3.0,"Yeah, and I'll just try it real time, real time."
36105,PS2,6,532.92,533.6,0.68,4.0,Communication.
36105,PS2,6,533.8,546.04,12.24,3.0,"System for multiple suppliers, multiple buyers I guess."
36105,PS2,6,547.08,548.2,1.12,4.0,"Counter parties, yeah."
36105,PS2,6,553.16,556.16,3.0,3.0,Who can buy and sell?
36105,PS2,6,563.92,569.32,5.4,2.0,We specify this is like stopping this short short shelf life like stop this.
36105,PS2,6,570.24,571.04,0.8,3.0,And be redundant.
36105,PS2,6,571.04,571.24,0.2,2.0,If it's.
36105,PS2,6,571.28,575.44,4.16,3.0,"Not Yeah, based on circumstances e.g."
36105,PS2,6,575.44,575.72,0.28,3.0,e.g.
36105,PS2,6,575.72,581.32,5.6,3.0,"If a supplier needs to sell a product, they can find a buyer more."
36105,PS2,6,581.32,581.88,0.56,2.0,Effectively.
36105,PS2,6,585.96,594.88,8.92,4.0,"I how can we say based on emergency requirements, probably that will sort of anything."
36105,PS2,6,594.88,598.92,4.04,3.0,Else sorry.
36105,PS2,6,598.92,600.12,1.2,4.0,I'm not getting EJ for.
36105,PS2,6,601.12,601.44,0.32,3.0,Example.
36105,PS2,6,602.08,602.8,0.72,4.0,For example.
36105,PS2,6,605.24,614.4,9.16,3.0,If a supplier has a high level stock.
36105,PS2,6,619.72,629.72,10.0,3.0,They can identify a buyer or to which they'll sell at a reduced rate.
36105,PS2,6,633.32,633.64,0.32,3.0,Does that?
36105,PS2,6,633.8,634.08,0.28,3.0,Does that?
36105,PS2,6,634.08,636.24,2.16,3.0,Does that cover it?
36105,PS2,6,652.52,653.24,0.72,4.0,Anything else?
36105,PS2,6,657.96,659.24,1.28,2.0,She's not expecting essays.
35932,PS1,6,8.2,8.4,0.2,1.0,There are.
35932,PS1,6,8.84,9.32,0.48,2.0,Many.
35932,PS1,6,9.32,11.84,2.52,3.0,Other options to replace the plastic I think.
35932,PS1,6,12.16,12.32,0.16,4.0,The.
35932,PS1,6,12.76,17.32,4.56,3.0,"Paper ones or biodegradable materials are also there, yeah."
35932,PS1,6,19.6,22.84,3.24,4.0,That's three agree that would be the one thing I would go towards is 3.
35932,PS1,6,22.84,28.04,5.2,4.0,If we offer like alternatives 'cause I think in in so many cases actually.
35932,PS1,6,28.04,39.28,11.24,4.0,So we got first on that last week and they said that it was kind of like the main thing main way to go is try to go like through all the uses of plastic and see where we can make cuts on that.
35932,PS1,6,39.28,40.72,1.44,4.0,"Not directly, just like a."
35932,PS1,6,40.76,41.24,0.48,5.0,Band.
35932,PS1,6,41.24,45.24,4.0,4.0,And and and say to people you should stop absolutely plastic cause in so many contexts.
35932,PS1,6,45.24,46.88,1.64,5.0,It's just like we have to use it for now.
35932,PS1,6,47.2,51.2,4.0,4.0,"For instance, in medical usage, actually plastic is used a lot and it's like."
35932,PS1,6,51.2,52.04,0.84,5.0,Super necessary.
35932,PS1,6,52.6,53.4,0.8,4.0,We try to.
35932,PS1,6,54.52,54.84,0.32,5.0,Like.
35932,PS1,6,55.56,56.04,0.48,4.0,We can.
35932,PS1,6,56.36,60.32,3.96,3.0,"We have to bring something replacement, strong replacement for the plastic."
35932,PS1,6,60.92,71.76,10.84,4.0,And I think that affordable also replacement and having that like help people to to make the change by maybe like helping them financially.
35932,PS1,6,71.76,72.48,0.72,5.0,For example.
35932,PS1,6,72.48,73.44,0.96,4.0,All the companies that.

36233,PS5,3,109.84,112.84,3.0,1.0,"So that's the, that's the usual way, but that's not the creative way."
36233,PS5,3,114.76,117.48,2.72,3.0,"Yeah, I mean, it's just screaming pay us more."

36233,PS5,3,129.4,145.2,15.8,3.0,"No, but also if you find the equivalent, I found that I know of more people in my life and in my and for myself from personal experience, I don't care if my job offers me a pizza party at the end of the year."
36233,PS5,3,145.2,147.48,2.28,3.0,I don't care about a end of year final event.
36233,PS5,3,147.52,154.88,7.36,3.0,"I don't care about things that cost money that are meant to increase like a better environment at work, right."
36233,PS5,3,155.08,157.88,2.8,3.0,I care about getting more money so because.
36233,PS5,3,158.8,159.68,0.88,1.0,People work for money.
36233,PS5,3,160.08,161.04,0.96,3.0,People work for money.
36233,PS5,3,161.04,170.4,9.36,3.0,"I don't work so that I can like maybe I don't know, have a big party at the end of the year and make sure I love all my employees, you know, like I don't."
36233,PS5,3,170.4,170.68,0.28,3.0,So let's.

36233,PS5,3,172.8,183.6,10.8,2.0,"Increase employee compensation, yeah, compensation package and then make it delayed sort of like."
36233,PS5,3,184.44,185.68,1.24,3.0,I don't like the idea of delayed.
36233,PS5,3,185.68,187.96,2.28,3.0,"We don't like it, No, just because."
36233,PS5,3,188.8,190.68,1.88,2.0,People were less likely to be if there's a.
36233,PS5,3,191.04,212.56,21.52,3.0,"Package people are definitely less likely to leave but I also just from my own personal experience like some people do not have the patience to wait for that right and I just don't yeah I, I I personally don't have the patience for promise of money at a later stage right especially if we're in situations where money certain amounts of money is needed now if."
36233,PS5,3,212.56,214.16,1.6,2.0,Your salary is high enough you don't leave.
36233,PS5,3,214.64,215.8,1.16,3.0,It right exactly so.
36233,PS5,3,215.8,216.28,0.48,2.0,OK.
36233,PS5,3,216.28,228.92,12.64,2.0,"And then the other one is deterring the tip deterring, Is it deterring the voluntary attrition by not giving people by by not giving people reference?"
36233,PS5,3,230.48,232.84,2.36,2.0,Is that legal here?
36233,PS5,3,233.2,238.32,5.12,3.0,"That doesn't feel, I mean, morally, yes, I mean morally, no, it's illegal."
36233,PS5,3,238.32,239.24,0.92,3.0,It should be legal.
36233,PS5,3,239.24,242.72,3.48,3.0,"I feel like that's crazy, but I do think that that happens."
36233,PS5,3,243.16,244.52,1.36,3.0,I I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.
36233,PS5,3,244.84,245.76,0.92,2.0,But do you think that works?
36233,PS5,3,246.44,252.52,6.08,3.0,"Yeah, but I I don't like the idea of like putting threaten, like something threatening."
36233,PS5,3,252.52,252.64,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36233,PS5,3,253.28,253.48,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
36233,PS5,3,254.64,256.48,1.84,2.0,Actually I don't like any of this idea.
36233,PS5,3,256.68,257.64,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, it's whatever."
36233,PS5,3,258.4,258.76,0.36,2.0,You know what?
36233,PS5,3,259.04,261.0,1.96,2.0,"If you make the company good enough, people don't."
36233,PS5,3,261.24,262.04,0.8,3.0,Leave exactly.
36233,PS5,3,262.08,262.6,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
36233,PS5,3,262.64,263.92,1.28,2.0,"You know what, that's just OK."
36233,PS5,3,263.96,264.16,0.2,2.0,That's.
36233,PS5,3,264.28,264.88,0.6,3.0,Our creative idea?
36233,PS5,3,264.88,265.44,0.56,3.0,That's us.
36233,PS5,3,266.08,267.4,1.32,2.0,Make the company fantastic.

36233,PS5,3,270.96,271.44,0.48,2.0,And then you do.
36233,PS5,3,271.48,273.56,2.08,2.0,"Like, I'm so proud to be the company."
36233,PS5,3,273.56,273.88,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
36233,PS5,3,274.32,277.6,3.28,2.0,And to forget about individual incentive or punishment.
36233,PS5,3,277.64,281.04,3.4,2.0,They just like improve the company status.
36233,PS5,3,281.28,281.8,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, apart."
36233,PS5,3,281.92,283.56,1.64,1.0,From that I have good salaries.
36233,PS5,3,283.8,284.08,0.28,2.0,I have.
36233,PS5,3,284.12,286.36,2.24,1.0,Good payment so that I don't have to leave.
36233,PS5,3,286.6,286.88,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36233,PS5,3,287.0,289.36,2.36,1.0,I I already got the best question myself.
36233,PS5,3,289.68,290.72,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, you got it."
36233,PS5,3,290.72,291.16,0.44,2.0,You sort it.
36233,PS5,3,291.28,291.36,0.08,1.0,Out.
36233,PS5,3,291.36,291.76,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36233,PS5,3,293.2,293.68,0.48,3.0,Company.
36233,PS5,3,293.68,295.2,1.52,3.0,What improved company?
36233,PS5,3,295.36,296.8,1.44,2.0,Improved company status.
36204,PS5,3,1.96,13.04,11.08,1.0,"OK, the company employees."
36204,PS5,3,13.8,14.32,0.52,2.0,Pay more.
36204,PS5,3,16.08,16.96,0.88,1.0,That's such an help.
36204,PS5,3,17.16,19.2,2.04,1.0,The best idea one of thoughts.
36204,PS5,3,24.24,25.24,1.0,1.0,Ban them from leaving.
36204,PS5,3,25.28,26.76,1.48,1.0,It will change to the.
36204,PS5,3,27.2,28.44,1.24,2.0,Give bad references.
36204,PS5,3,34.28,36.68,2.4,1.0,Includes leaving like because they want to leave.
36204,PS5,3,42.72,49.6,6.88,2.0,"Maybe the longer you stay at the company, the more you're being paid under."
36204,PS5,3,49.68,54.32,4.64,2.0,"If you can start a new a new kind of loose type, I don't think it's very great."
36204,PS5,3,56.68,64.44,7.76,1.0,Maybe go like increase the benefits like I don't know what kind of benefits may give you work.
36204,PS5,3,66.24,69.08,2.84,3.0,I think salary and benefits are the strategy companies.
36204,PS5,3,69.08,70.16,1.08,1.0,That are doing.
36204,PS5,3,70.16,80.12,9.96,3.0,Now I know again in China they they give you a cat when you enter the company but you cannot take the getaway when you leave.
36204,PS5,3,80.84,82.28,1.44,3.0,So like you're bond with?
36204,PS5,3,82.28,84.08,1.8,1.0,The cat that's.
36204,PS5,3,84.48,87.44,2.96,3.0,"Great, so everyone is having a pet in the office."
36204,PS5,3,88.72,93.12,4.4,3.0,"So it's like you have a child inside the workplace, so you cannot leave."
36204,PS5,3,93.12,95.72,2.6,1.0,The that is the most creative idea that that is.
36204,PS5,3,95.8,97.72,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, but the cat leaves at the office."
36204,PS5,3,98.16,98.4,0.24,1.0,Sorry.
36204,PS5,3,98.64,99.84,1.2,2.0,Cat leaves at the office.

36204,PS5,3,102.44,102.88,0.44,3.0,What they do you?
36204,PS5,3,102.88,104.72,1.84,1.0,Don't get to view between a cat and a dog.
36204,PS5,3,105.04,105.56,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, you can."
36204,PS5,3,105.92,110.92,5.0,3.0,"You can, but cat is what most companies do because."
36204,PS5,3,111.2,111.64,0.44,1.0,You don't need.
36204,PS5,3,111.64,113.12,1.48,3.0,"To want the cat, yeah."
36204,PS5,3,113.96,114.04,0.08,2.0,Wow.
36204,PS5,3,115.68,116.2,0.52,1.0,I see.
36204,PS5,3,116.32,117.52,1.2,1.0,That's crazy.
36204,PS5,3,117.56,119.04,1.48,1.0,Like they give me like.
36204,PS5,3,119.24,127.36,8.12,3.0,"Because they want to keep the cat on their own, so I guess having emotional connection will be."
36204,PS5,3,127.8,127.96,0.16,2.0,That's.
36204,PS5,3,128.44,128.76,0.32,1.0,Crazy.
36204,PS5,3,129.6,134.48,4.88,3.0,"And they come and you, you need, you are responsible to life with the cats."
36204,PS5,3,134.48,137.6,3.12,3.0,"So to come, there's no very extra course, but."
36204,PS5,3,139.8,141.84,2.04,1.0,They give you a kettle pet.
36204,PS5,3,143.48,145.92,2.44,1.0,"That is the worst thing, but I could have thought of that."
36204,PS5,3,145.96,156.6,10.64,1.0,But that's like really smart to like create an emotional connection with you and the company and you can't take the pet when you leave.
36204,PS5,3,157.4,158.92,1.52,3.0,So you have more things.
36204,PS5,3,158.92,159.16,0.24,3.0,So it's.
36204,PS5,3,159.28,164.52,5.24,1.0,"Easy, you stay in the job and leave your life for another time and then to be."
36204,PS5,3,164.72,165.08,0.36,3.0,Paid.
36204,PS5,3,167.72,168.72,1.0,1.0,That's insane.
36204,PS5,3,168.76,169.52,0.76,1.0,That is like.
36204,PS5,3,169.76,169.88,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36204,PS5,3,170.0,173.04,3.04,3.0,I think that's the company that I want to join that.

36204,PS5,3,173.88,174.92,1.04,3.0,Do I really want to leave?
36204,PS5,3,178.52,184.36,5.84,1.0,"Can you imagine for like, Can you imagine like going to court because like you want to leave your job, but but you are your cat."
36204,PS5,3,184.36,187.64,3.28,1.0,"I thought you both of the law, I'm sure."
36204,PS5,3,191.84,193.04,1.2,2.0,"No, just took your idea."
36204,PS5,3,193.04,196.08,3.04,2.0,It's emotional connection and but but how exactly?
36204,PS5,3,196.08,196.28,0.2,2.0,How would?
36204,PS5,3,196.76,197.4,0.64,1.0,We do that.
36204,PS5,3,197.52,198.8,1.28,1.0,"OK, so not by having a pet."
36204,PS5,3,199.0,200.24,1.24,1.0,How do you create English?
36204,PS5,3,201.0,201.32,0.32,2.0,Connection.
36204,PS5,3,201.32,202.96,1.64,2.0,"Well, pet is the best idea is the best idea."
36204,PS5,3,204.16,211.32,7.16,1.0,"Because who like if you wouldn't give people a child, No, but like, you know, like a child I."
36204,PS5,3,230.3,237.74,7.44,3.0,"Think for some companies if you are the founding member of the company for a start up, they'll also give you a better title for you to stay."
36204,PS5,3,238.54,240.82,2.28,3.0,So I guess that's also just emotional.
36204,PS5,3,241.74,242.42,0.68,1.0,Gives you more value.
36204,PS5,3,247.52,252.32,4.8,2.0,By issuing so we can do a list maybe or no pets in the best.
36204,PS5,3,254.88,255.08,0.2,1.0,Idea.
36204,PS5,3,255.52,269.28,13.76,1.0,"But like any pet, like you choose from any pet or like from a list of pets to like a hamster, a dog, a cat, I don't know."
36204,PS5,3,281.08,282.84,1.76,3.0,I think giving up free stuff will.
36204,PS5,3,302.16,304.64,2.48,2.0,"Also giving special, I mean we can delete them."
36204,PS5,3,304.64,310.2,5.56,2.0,I'm just kind of thinking that's giving special titles to the sheet.
36204,PS5,3,346.82,347.9,1.08,2.0,The pet ID is so.
36204,PS5,3,347.9,348.1,0.2,1.0,Good.
36204,PS5,3,348.86,350.06,1.2,2.0,That I cannot think of.
36204,PS5,3,351.38,351.62,0.24,1.0,Anything.
36204,PS5,3,351.62,355.22,3.6,2.0,I think you should put that on.
36204,PS5,3,355.56,356.64,1.08,2.0,How do we put that goodbye?
36204,PS5,3,363.44,375.56,12.12,1.0,"They're giving each employee a pet when they join the company, making sure that the car they want to leave the car, but with them that is cold."
36204,PS5,3,375.84,381.6,5.76,2.0,"Cat, dog, turtle, fish."
36204,PS5,3,386.64,404.96,18.32,2.0,I don't know when they when they join the company and if they leave they lose the pet.
36204,PS5,3,405.16,405.28,0.12,1.0,It's.
36204,PS5,3,408.52,408.68,0.16,2.0,Hard.
36204,PS5,3,408.72,442.28,33.56,2.0,It's actually emotional blackmail the as the pet leaves because let's say animal leaves in the office.
36204,PS5,3,448.52,452.76,4.24,1.0,"Yeah, OK, I think that works."
36204,PS5,3,455.16,457.0,1.84,2.0,Should we submit them or Yeah.
35592,PS3,6,2.28,2.4,0.12,1.0,This.
35592,PS3,6,9.68,10.12,0.44,2.0,Is so.
35592,PS3,6,10.2,10.6,0.4,3.0,Strange.
35592,PS3,6,10.88,11.24,0.36,3.0,Very.
35592,PS3,6,11.24,11.48,0.24,4.0,Funny.
35592,PS3,6,11.56,12.6,1.04,3.0,Because I'm so sorry.
35592,PS3,6,14.84,18.72,3.88,2.0,"Because yeah, the UK and Canada would be like, dead immediately."
35592,PS3,6,19.08,19.28,0.2,2.0,I don't.
35592,PS3,6,20.72,22.36,1.64,4.0,Know can you just is it?
35592,PS3,6,23.72,24.92,1.2,1.0,Can you make it simple enough?
35592,PS3,6,24.96,28.2,3.24,4.0,And just switch from sorry to I apologize or oh.
35592,PS3,6,28.24,28.64,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, is."
35592,PS3,6,28.64,30.16,1.52,4.0,It like the same concept or it?
35592,PS3,6,30.16,45.12,14.96,5.0,Can like develop like a resent to mention you like it can test your like test your emotion like when you want to say sorry there will be some like signal.
35592,PS3,6,45.16,46.84,1.68,2.0,Like an electric shock person.
35592,PS3,6,46.84,48.52,1.68,2.0,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
35592,PS3,6,48.52,48.92,0.4,2.0,I like that.
35592,PS3,6,48.92,50.24,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35592,PS3,6,51.08,51.52,0.44,5.0,I really like.
35592,PS3,6,51.52,51.76,0.24,2.0,"That, yeah."
35592,PS3,6,52.0,54.84,2.84,5.0,"Yeah, to remind you not to see."
35592,PS3,6,54.92,55.12,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35592,PS3,6,55.88,56.08,0.2,5.0,Is that?
35592,PS3,6,56.08,58.56,2.48,6.0,"OK, if you'll be OK, just just."
35592,PS3,6,60.72,65.52,4.8,2.0,So like like a medical wrist wristband?
35592,PS3,6,65.56,65.6,0.04,2.0,Oh.
35592,PS3,6,68.32,69.04,0.72,5.0,My gosh.
35592,PS3,6,78.84,80.04,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35592,PS3,6,80.32,80.6,0.28,2.0,That's good.
35592,PS3,6,82.28,82.4,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,1.48,12.36,10.88,1.0,The first question is could lead to uncontrolled cost and efficiency.
36119,PS2,6,21.97,23.41,1.44,2.0,That is very broad question.
36119,PS2,6,23.41,30.97,7.56,2.0,"Yeah, Yeah, there's a very specific, there's so many probabilities because the supply chain so."
36119,PS2,6,32.6,33.28,0.68,3.0,Does anyone have a?
36119,PS2,6,33.36,36.68,3.32,2.0,"Background No, I'm not, but it's sort of an MBA bottle, so."
36119,PS2,6,38.08,43.08,5.0,1.0,"Well, I think it is it is the one area of work."
36119,PS2,6,43.08,47.28,4.2,1.0,So there is there are many answer that is not creative.
36119,PS2,6,47.28,48.68,1.4,1.0,"I mean, we, we have."
36119,PS2,6,48.84,50.96,2.12,2.0,But what more vulnerabilities are there really?
36119,PS2,6,51.4,51.84,0.44,2.0,I'm not.
36119,PS2,6,53.36,53.52,0.16,1.0,OK.
36119,PS2,6,54.8,58.8,4.0,1.0,"Yeah, I think I, I think it is the like fluctuations in the demand, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,58.8,61.92,3.12,1.0,"Like sometimes customer demand is high, but sometimes it's low."
36119,PS2,6,61.92,75.92,14.0,1.0,"So if we if we can predict the exact number of demands, maybe we sometimes we over if we oversupply, we produce too much and it's lead to the the cost of warehousing increase something like that."
36119,PS2,6,75.92,85.04,9.12,1.0,So I think the normal solution is to try to predict as accurate as possible for the demand.
36119,PS2,6,85.04,89.6,4.56,1.0,"Yeah, so, but this one, I think they want something creative, like something new."
36119,PS2,6,89.88,91.44,1.56,2.0,But it's something uncreative.
36119,PS2,6,91.44,97.84,6.4,2.0,"First, I think what some companies do this is to do they do stash drop basically."
36119,PS2,6,98.08,99.32,1.24,2.0,So that stash drop.
36119,PS2,6,99.32,102.48,3.16,2.0,So they don't they don't like have a constant supply of some products.
36119,PS2,6,102.92,105.8,2.88,2.0,So they just do drops and customers have to buy through those drops.
36119,PS2,6,105.8,108.52,2.72,2.0,And it's like 100 products only and 100 items only.
36119,PS2,6,108.52,112.8,4.28,2.0,"So they don't have a lot of like goods being stored in the in the manufacturer, in the manufacturer."
36119,PS2,6,113.32,116.56,3.24,2.0,"Yeah, I'm not sure it's a creative solution, but it is a solution I guess."
36119,PS2,6,117.48,122.76,5.28,3.0,Do you mind if we write down the points made for the vulnerabilities first and?
36119,PS2,6,122.76,123.2,0.44,2.0,Then solution.
36119,PS2,6,124.92,126.28,1.36,3.0,So the first thing was.
36119,PS2,6,126.32,128.08,1.76,2.0,Unpredictable demand unpredictable.
36119,PS2,6,141.14,143.74,2.6,1.0,"Sorry, unpredictable demand."
36119,PS2,6,144.22,145.06,0.84,1.0,And then what?
36119,PS2,6,146.26,147.5,1.24,2.0,I don't think we can.
36119,PS2,6,149.46,149.82,0.36,4.0,Do any other?
36119,PS2,6,149.82,151.74,1.92,4.0,It was about security.
36119,PS2,6,151.98,159.56,7.58,4.0,"I don't know if like because it says supply chain security, I don't know, you know, it's talking about like actual safety."
36119,PS2,6,160.4,161.52,1.12,2.0,"Of people stealing from Yeah, I know."
36119,PS2,6,163.6,164.4,0.8,5.0,Seating items.
36119,PS2,6,165.52,168.04,2.52,3.0,Is it going to the the the supply chain?
36119,PS2,6,168.04,168.76,0.72,2.0,Supply chain.
36119,PS2,6,169.48,175.2,5.72,2.0,"I'm wondering if this is actually about supply chain actually, because it's demand, it's not vulnerability in a way."
36119,PS2,6,176.04,176.92,0.88,1.0,"Well, So what?"
36119,PS2,6,176.92,177.32,0.4,1.0,What do you?
36119,PS2,6,177.32,177.92,0.6,5.0,Think.
36119,PS2,6,178.56,179.96,1.4,2.0,"Manufacturing stuff, storage like."
36119,PS2,6,181.36,181.92,0.56,5.0,Storage of.
36119,PS2,6,182.76,184.68,1.92,2.0,Products it's.
36119,PS2,6,184.68,185.6,0.92,1.0,A stall product.
36119,PS2,6,186.12,187.16,1.04,2.0,Storage of products.
36119,PS2,6,187.6,199.56,11.96,5.0,"Yeah, Manufacturing stuff, manufacturing like, like if there's like a limitation or I was going to say if there's a limit on a certain component, say or if it's hard to come by, then it."
36119,PS2,6,200.2,202.4,2.2,6.0,"Does depend on what we are, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,202.84,203.16,0.32,5.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,203.44,211.28,7.84,6.0,But maybe like there's like a problem with something can only be produced in like summer or.
36119,PS2,6,212.28,213.36,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, it could be like."
36119,PS2,6,213.48,214.16,0.68,5.0,"Season, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,214.24,214.84,0.6,2.0,Seasonal.
36119,PS2,6,219.04,236.4,17.36,3.0,"What about the general just diversification of sources of of the sources of, you know, if if you have a problem with one company all of a sudden and you you rely only on that you have a problem all of so how do you call it?"
36119,PS2,6,238.04,238.68,0.64,1.0,I'm not sure.
36119,PS2,6,239.08,243.88,4.8,2.0,"I mean, you phrase it quite well, like it's just that you diversify your your sources."
36119,PS2,6,244.76,245.48,0.72,5.0,Of materials.
36119,PS2,6,245.76,246.84,1.08,2.0,Of materials.
36119,PS2,6,247.32,248.56,1.24,1.0,"That is a solution, right?"
36119,PS2,6,248.56,249.24,0.68,2.0,That is a solution.
36119,PS2,6,249.24,250.6,1.36,1.0,"OK, what?"
36119,PS2,6,250.6,251.64,1.04,2.0,Is a creative I'm.
36119,PS2,6,253.0,254.88,1.88,5.0,"Cloning towards stash drops, I won't lie."
36119,PS2,6,255.96,258.8,2.84,2.0,I'm not sure stash drop is really actually tackling a vulnerability.
36119,PS2,6,259.0,268.96,9.96,5.0,"Well, I mean, but isn't it sort of, I mean stash drop in the way that when a red bird does it, you know where they sort of get with the audit first so they know exactly how much they need to create that's."
36119,PS2,6,269.76,269.88,0.12,1.0,True.
36119,PS2,6,270.36,271.52,1.16,1.0,I will leave your idea first.
36119,PS2,6,271.8,273.68,1.88,1.0,Diversified portfolio or something?
36119,PS2,6,276.4,278.48,2.08,4.0,And I have the AI in my head.
36119,PS2,6,278.88,279.56,0.68,5.0,Because yeah.
36119,PS2,6,279.96,280.08,0.12,2.0,You.
36119,PS2,6,280.12,282.04,1.92,4.0,Could also try to predict the man.
36119,PS2,6,283.32,284.16,0.84,5.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,286.76,286.88,0.12,1.0,And.
36119,PS2,6,287.4,298.8,11.4,2.0,Then what Sheen is doing is actually they they have like constant real time data of what customers are looking for and they they actually produce the items according to customers demand real time.
36119,PS2,6,300.56,303.32,2.76,1.0,Predict demand right and use and cheese and.
36119,PS2,6,303.52,304.44,0.92,2.0,"Predict demand, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,314.12,315.32,1.2,2.0,Efficient delivery schedules.
36119,PS2,6,325.93,334.57,8.64,2.0,"But sometimes we like like maybe some, sometimes it will cost it will it will take more time than predicted to make something, I'm not sure what."
36119,PS2,6,334.81,348.37,13.56,2.0,"But that that that will relate to inefficient delivery schedules, because if you don't have any items stored and you have to make for example shoes or a particular size for them, then you have to wait maybe a month for them to be shipped."
36119,PS2,6,349.25,349.45,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,355.32,356.28,0.96,3.0,How would you phrase that?
36119,PS2,6,356.4,363.12,6.72,2.0,How would you phrase that just miss is actually a demand problem with demand?
36119,PS2,6,363.16,363.36,0.2,1.0,Is the.
36119,PS2,6,363.36,365.04,1.68,2.0,Demand problem is the demand problem.
36119,PS2,6,365.2,367.8,2.6,6.0,I think it's it sounds like it's all about demand.
36119,PS2,6,368.16,368.4,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,368.48,371.56,3.08,2.0,"It's all about demand, although the question is about supply, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,373.04,374.92,1.88,6.0,The supply is very tight to demand.
36119,PS2,6,376.32,378.52,2.2,1.0,"No, I think the question is not about the supply."
36119,PS2,6,378.52,379.52,1.0,1.0,It's a supply chain.
36119,PS2,6,379.52,382.64,3.12,1.0,So I think it's include like it's include supply and demand.
36119,PS2,6,382.64,383.96,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, included everything."
36119,PS2,6,384.08,385.68,1.6,1.0,"So that's OK, I think."
36119,PS2,6,386.44,387.36,0.92,2.0,So what is a creative?
36119,PS2,6,387.48,387.84,0.36,1.0,Solution.
36119,PS2,6,387.84,389.4,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, this one is not really."
36119,PS2,6,389.4,391.0,1.6,1.0,"It's just like, you know?"
36119,PS2,6,391.68,392.16,0.48,5.0,I can't.
36119,PS2,6,392.96,393.08,0.12,2.0,I.
36119,PS2,6,395.16,399.4,4.24,3.0,"Like the vulnerability, unpredictable demand, create a solution, predict demand."
36119,PS2,6,403.36,405.36,2.0,2.0,Is that creative way to predict demand?
36119,PS2,6,405.68,406.44,0.76,5.0,I think that might.
36119,PS2,6,407.6,407.68,0.08,4.0,Be.
36119,PS2,6,410.12,410.32,0.2,2.0,What?
36119,PS2,6,411.28,412.04,0.76,2.0,Machine learning?
36119,PS2,6,412.2,412.72,0.52,2.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,416.0,417.96,1.96,3.0,"You said something about stash drops, right?"
36119,PS2,6,418.64,418.92,0.28,5.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,418.92,420.76,1.84,5.0,"I mean, it's your suggestion."
36119,PS2,6,420.96,422.44,1.48,5.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
36119,PS2,6,422.44,434.32,11.88,5.0,"I mean just sort of I'm thinking rather than the traditional like the stores always open and they have to, you know, they have to sort of to a degree predict demand and then get supply in regards to doing this sort of stash drop when they get all the."
36119,PS2,6,434.32,436.12,1.8,2.0,"Orders, like 3 orders, Yeah, basically."
36119,PS2,6,436.12,437.8,1.68,5.0,That that might be a creative.
36119,PS2,6,438.12,439.6,1.48,2.0,That is more creative than usual.
36119,PS2,6,439.64,440.68,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, usual this is."
36119,PS2,6,440.88,443.92,3.04,1.0,More I I don't get it how how it works or at.
36119,PS2,6,444.0,444.36,0.36,3.0,Least in.
36119,PS2,6,444.96,445.32,0.36,5.0,Many.
36119,PS2,6,445.32,445.92,0.6,1.0,Many intentions.
36119,PS2,6,446.92,447.2,0.28,3.0,"No, but."
36119,PS2,6,448.48,450.04,1.56,2.0,We that doesn't mean that's what.
36119,PS2,6,450.04,450.36,0.32,5.0,We don't.
36119,PS2,6,450.92,451.0,0.08,2.0,Know.
36119,PS2,6,452.4,456.36,3.96,5.0,Maybe it's creative because it doesn't work in them.
36119,PS2,6,456.4,459.0,2.6,6.0,But but we we are trying to be creative and not functional.
36119,PS2,6,461.08,462.64,1.56,1.0,I think we have to shoot only one.
36119,PS2,6,462.88,463.16,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,463.48,463.72,0.24,2.0,We can.
36119,PS2,6,463.92,464.84,0.92,1.0,"Do that, can we shoot?"
36119,PS2,6,465.56,466.48,0.92,2.0,"OK, I can."
36119,PS2,6,466.56,466.92,0.36,2.0,I can.
36119,PS2,6,467.0,467.24,0.24,2.0,I can.
36119,PS2,6,467.88,470.44,2.56,6.0,Also the countdown is giving me I.
36119,PS2,6,470.48,472.2,1.72,2.0,Know we only have 4 minutes left now.
36119,PS2,6,472.4,475.96,3.56,2.0,"Yeah, OK, creative solution chosen."
36119,PS2,6,479.24,479.48,0.24,2.0,Use.
36119,PS2,6,480.6,482.64,2.04,2.0,I actually can't phrase myself right now here.
36119,PS2,6,483.12,484.68,1.56,2.0,Use desktop.
36119,PS2,6,485.28,485.84,0.56,5.0,Or.
36119,PS2,6,487.72,500.64,12.92,2.0,To make customers pre-order items that for manufacturing then yeah.
36119,PS2,6,500.64,503.16,2.52,2.0,Is there any elaboration that I can add there?
36119,PS2,6,504.52,510.32,5.8,5.0,"In order to yeah, in order to accurately know the demand."
36119,PS2,6,510.32,514.8,4.48,2.0,"Yeah, in order to in order to accurately because."
36119,PS2,6,515.92,517.24,1.32,5.0,It's already predicted because you know.
36119,PS2,6,517.4,525.12,7.72,2.0,"The demand, exactly, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,526.16,530.2,4.04,5.0,Could we shove in something about diversifying that portfolio in there as well?
36119,PS2,6,530.6,537.84,7.24,5.0,"We know we're supposed to only have one solution, but if we make it because the AI is going to spit out like a three to four line mini paragraph, isn't it?"
36119,PS2,6,538.72,539.44,0.72,2.0,Manufacturing items.
36119,PS2,6,540.72,545.56,4.84,3.0,You still think we have to differentiate between industries where that's possible?
36119,PS2,6,545.96,548.88,2.92,2.0,"Yeah, this is more like for like clothing items maybe."
36119,PS2,6,548.88,549.88,1.0,2.0,I guess you mean you.
36119,PS2,6,549.88,551.28,1.4,5.0,Could you could put where possible?
36119,PS2,6,551.52,552.72,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, where possible."
36119,PS2,6,555.72,566.04,10.32,2.0,"Possible in industries like closing, Definitely not software engineering."
36119,PS2,6,570.76,572.04,1.28,2.0,Do you have anything to add?
36119,PS2,6,572.52,572.76,0.24,1.0,No.
36119,PS2,6,573.56,575.8,2.24,1.0,Should we delete the previous idea?
36119,PS2,6,575.8,576.16,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,576.32,579.44,3.12,2.0,"I don't know, like do we, do we do we just put the idea there?"
36119,PS2,6,579.64,580.36,0.72,2.0,Do we have to?
36119,PS2,6,581.24,583.16,1.92,2.0,"Because again, for AI they do have, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,583.48,583.64,0.16,6.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,584.16,584.44,0.28,2.0,I think.
36119,PS2,6,585.32,587.88,2.56,5.0,"Yeah, we've noticed what we chose, we chose."
36119,PS2,6,588.0,588.4,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, if."
36119,PS2,6,588.6,591.6,3.0,5.0,The study The study might choose to just ignore the text about that.
36119,PS2,6,591.6,592.48,0.88,5.0,And let's not have a.
36119,PS2,6,592.48,592.76,0.28,2.0,Problem.
36119,PS2,6,593.88,594.16,0.28,5.0,All right.
36119,PS2,6,595.32,595.52,0.2,1.0,"OK, so."
36119,PS2,6,595.88,605.56,9.68,2.0,"I think we can move on, maybe because I don't think we can add anything now unless we can, unless we can actually like create a solution too for industries where this is not possible."
36119,PS2,6,606.56,607.04,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
36119,PS2,6,608.96,612.56,3.6,1.0,"Yeah, we we can, we can aim to make only one creative solution."
36119,PS2,6,612.68,613.28,0.6,1.0,I think that's that's.
36119,PS2,6,613.4,614.44,1.04,2.0,"That's one, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,614.84,617.48,2.64,2.0,"OK, I'm I'm, I mean, it's the the problem with the question."
36119,PS2,6,617.48,618.4,0.92,2.0,It's not specific enough.
36119,PS2,6,618.4,618.52,0.12,5.0,Like.
36119,PS2,6,618.88,625.08,6.2,6.0,"I mean, what comes to mind is just like create demand in the sense that you're like advertising."
36119,PS2,6,625.08,626.8,1.72,2.0,"You're advertising, I mean you are advertising."
36119,PS2,6,626.8,628.8,2.0,2.0,"This is customer acquisition as well at the same time, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,630.28,630.56,0.28,6.0,OK.
36119,PS2,6,633.12,637.88,4.76,2.0,Pretty much create and also create and and and and.
36119,PS2,6,638.4,638.96,0.56,6.0,Create it.
36119,PS2,6,638.96,639.16,0.2,2.0,Sounds.
36119,PS2,6,643.2,643.68,0.48,6.0,Very bad.
36119,PS2,6,646.84,647.68,0.84,2.0,"OK, kill like I do."
36119,PS2,6,647.68,648.64,0.96,6.0,Think they do that?
36119,PS2,6,648.84,650.48,1.64,2.0,"Yeah, killing two birds in one stone."
36119,PS2,6,650.56,651.4,0.84,2.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
36119,PS2,6,651.48,651.68,0.2,2.0,OK.
36119,PS2,6,651.68,652.28,0.6,2.0,I'll add that.
36119,PS2,6,652.56,652.92,0.36,6.0,This is.
36119,PS2,6,652.92,653.04,0.12,2.0,Well.
36119,PS2,6,653.16,660.52,7.36,6.0,"Now the China biscuits came out, came out in Italy, everyone wanted them, so they had to limit the amount you could buy in."
36119,PS2,6,660.52,661.24,0.72,2.0,The supermarket.
36119,PS2,6,661.44,661.92,0.48,2.0,"Oh, OK."
36119,PS2,6,662.88,663.36,0.48,4.0,When what?
36119,PS2,6,663.48,669.0,5.52,6.0,Came out Nutella like you can only buy 2 per family like it's it's ridiculous.
36119,PS2,6,669.64,672.0,2.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, because, but this is a value because."
36119,PS2,6,672.08,674.76,2.68,6.0,Because they came out and I was waiting for them to come out.
36119,PS2,6,675.24,676.72,1.48,2.0,It's like the earnest of biscuits.
36119,PS2,6,676.76,677.32,0.56,5.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,679.08,679.72,0.64,2.0,"Alright, sure, we just."
36119,PS2,6,679.84,680.08,0.24,3.0,Move on.
36119,PS2,6,680.08,685.44,5.36,3.0,Maybe 18 for the industries that don't have the possibility.
36119,PS2,6,685.76,686.52,0.76,2.0,That cannot.
36119,PS2,6,687.2,691.24,4.04,3.0,Keep a diverse set of supplier and make them bid.
36119,PS2,6,692.8,693.6,0.8,1.0,Keep a diverse.
36119,PS2,6,693.92,696.8,2.88,2.0,Set liars and make them make.
36119,PS2,6,696.8,701.56,4.76,3.0,Them bid for your orders on a regular basis.
36119,PS2,6,703.0,705.52,2.52,2.0,"On the record, but if they if they do, pick one and."
36119,PS2,6,705.88,709.0,3.12,3.0,Not do it then Still there's hopefully five others or something.
36119,PS2,6,709.08,709.4,0.32,3.0,I think it.
36119,PS2,6,710.16,710.4,0.24,1.0,"Would, yeah."
36119,PS2,6,711.16,711.28,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35773,PS3,3,2.08,20.96,18.88,1.0,"Oh OK, this is like the hardest thing."
35773,PS3,3,21.96,22.44,0.48,2.0,That's true.
35773,PS3,3,22.56,24.48,1.92,2.0,"I mean, because it's the most ridiculous."
35773,PS3,3,27.08,29.56,2.48,3.0,Like we just change the language to a different.
35773,PS3,3,29.76,31.44,1.68,2.0,"One we call, we say."
35773,PS3,3,31.88,32.56,0.68,3.0,English is done.
35773,PS3,3,33.12,33.96,0.84,3.0,We're speaking French.
35773,PS3,3,35.36,42.4,7.04,2.0,"Well, I think that's rather revolutionary and maybe we'll just change or leave."
35773,PS3,3,42.4,43.92,1.52,2.0,"Sorry, out of the language."
35773,PS3,3,44.68,44.8,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35773,PS3,3,45.4,65.36,19.96,2.0,"And we'll cattle prod every time everyone says the word sorry, they get some sort of electric ship."
35773,PS3,3,67.48,68.64,1.16,1.0,How do we implement that though?
35773,PS3,3,68.64,69.84,1.2,1.0,Like if there's so many people.
35773,PS3,3,70.96,74.56,3.6,3.0,Microphone and you all must weigh on government issue.
35773,PS3,3,74.72,75.8,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, shock."
35773,PS3,3,82.52,87.96,5.44,2.0,"OK, we we take it out of school usage, we take it out of kindergarten usage."
35773,PS3,3,87.96,89.72,1.76,2.0,We take it out right from the start.
35773,PS3,3,89.96,91.4,1.44,2.0,Children don't learn the word.
35773,PS3,3,91.6,92.88,1.28,1.0,"But that's still like, that's too late."
35773,PS3,3,93.4,96.44,3.04,2.0,"I know, but if we can do it for future generations."
35773,PS3,3,97.36,98.12,0.76,3.0,But then.
35773,PS3,3,98.12,100.32,2.2,1.0,That's the Suppose that the pandemic's going to last that long.
35773,PS3,3,101.64,105.24,3.6,3.0,Just secretly murder people by sorry.
35773,PS3,3,105.76,106.6,0.84,2.0,"Sorry, Scott."
35773,PS3,3,109.52,111.88,2.36,1.0,"Isn't like the, the purpose of like trying to stop?"
35773,PS3,3,111.88,127.4,15.52,1.0,"Because if he's the bigger purpose of that, I mean, like, I guess like the only way, I guess logically speaking, like you, you, you can only try to turn that word into like a different form so that it doesn't touch that word."
35773,PS3,3,127.4,130.76,3.36,1.0,"So like maybe don't say sorry, say sauce or something."
35773,PS3,3,130.76,136.36,5.6,1.0,"Sauce, promote, make alternatives."
35773,PS3,3,141.92,142.52,0.6,1.0,Like like.
35773,PS3,3,145.96,150.68,4.72,2.0,"Just don't know how you police that because people would just go I didn't say sorry, I said souls."
35773,PS3,3,152.64,153.32,0.68,1.0,"I mean, this is odd."
35773,PS3,3,153.8,157.8,4.0,3.0,I like the creativity of an ever listening microphone that shocks you if you say sorry.
35773,PS3,3,157.84,169.84,12.0,2.0,"I do, yeah and yeah have people reporting on each."
35773,PS3,3,169.84,170.84,1.0,3.0,Other it's very 19.
35773,PS3,3,171.24,183.36,12.12,2.0,84 but yeah it's creative I I'm literally or ban speech just.
35773,PS3,3,187.4,187.92,0.52,3.0,Mumbles.
35773,PS3,3,188.36,189.44,1.08,2.0,No one can speak.
35773,PS3,3,189.88,191.2,1.32,2.0,Everything has to be written down.
35773,PS3,3,191.88,193.4,1.52,2.0,It says saying the word sorry.
35773,PS3,3,197.24,198.16,0.92,3.0,You can't say anything.
35773,PS3,3,198.8,200.12,1.32,2.0,It just can't spin.
35773,PS3,3,202.28,203.2,0.92,3.0,This study's over.
35773,PS3,3,213.18,214.9,1.72,2.0,Don't shock anyone that uses it.
35773,PS3,3,219.98,221.02,1.04,3.0,A perfect sense money.
35773,PS3,3,221.14,222.7,1.56,3.0,You don't even need to get the police involved.
35773,PS3,3,222.98,223.42,0.44,3.0,It's a.
35773,PS3,3,226.02,228.66,2.64,2.0,Small electric shop you think it's got to be.
35773,PS3,3,230.6,233.36,2.76,2.0,It's got to be a disincentive.
35773,PS3,3,233.8,235.2,1.4,2.0,There's a tiny electric shop.
35773,PS3,3,235.2,236.6,1.4,2.0,"People wouldn't learn with them, Yeah."
35773,PS3,3,269.48,272.72,3.24,3.0,"Practically, even if we could create it."
35773,PS3,3,273.32,280.16,6.84,2.0,"There is no practical way, there is no creative idea to reduce the word the the spread of the word."
35773,PS3,3,280.16,280.52,0.36,2.0,Sorry.
35773,PS3,3,280.92,282.36,1.44,3.0,Part of the first one.
35773,PS3,3,282.8,283.88,1.08,3.0,Just don't say sorry you guys.
35773,PS3,3,290.88,293.96,3.08,2.0,Then you'd have all sorts of underground cults coming forward.
35773,PS3,3,294.68,306.4,11.72,2.0,The sorry club everyone meets is dis disused warehouses and things just say the word sorry again and again and again.
35773,PS3,3,310.4,313.96,3.56,2.0,"Anyway, I think I don't think we're going to get any better."
35773,PS3,3,313.96,314.0,0.04,2.0,I.
35773,PS3,3,314.0,314.8,0.8,3.0,Think the idea is mature.
35773,PS3,3,318.16,318.76,0.6,1.0,"OK, be nauseous."
36353,PS2,6,2.56,10.2,7.64,1.0,OK Vulnerabilities within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
36353,PS2,6,10.68,16.72,6.04,1.0,"Please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security, OK?"
36353,PS2,6,22.68,24.88,2.2,2.0,You think it depends on the supply chain surely?
36353,PS2,6,32.24,48.04,15.8,1.0,"We could suggest, see when we're looking at vulnerabilities with supply chain, we're looking at maybe hiccups with supplies which definitely will affect costs and then hamper deliveries arrangements."
36353,PS2,6,48.28,63.64,15.36,1.0,"So what we could suggest one could be overstocking maybe, yes, yes of of longer of durable goods that maybe not perishables, yeah."
36353,PS2,6,64.12,85.08,20.96,1.0,"Then secondly, we could also think of more efficient delivery system such that maybe online you online, online orders possibly that gives room for a time for it to be delivered and that way you know the bottlenecks of delivery may be contained."
36353,PS2,6,87.92,95.72,7.8,3.0,"Overstock, you would see that affect some of the groups that might have some inspiration dates if it's not sold."
36353,PS2,6,96.72,97.0,0.28,4.0,Early.
36353,PS2,6,97.36,105.44,8.08,3.0,"So it's not sold early, it might just get expired on the shelf or something when you overstock."
36353,PS2,6,105.56,107.0,1.44,2.0,Specifically durable goods like.
36353,PS2,6,107.2,112.76,5.56,1.0,"Not parishable, but I mentioned if it's a durable goods, maybe that has longer inspiration for that."
36353,PS2,6,112.76,113.0,0.24,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36353,PS2,6,113.0,114.92,1.92,1.0,But traditional books you can't order overstock.
36353,PS2,6,115.12,119.36,4.24,3.0,You can also check the patronage in that particular.
36353,PS2,6,120.4,122.32,1.92,5.0,Vulnerability is within a supply.
36353,PS2,6,123.8,124.56,0.76,3.0,Chain also called.
36353,PS2,6,125.4,126.56,1.16,1.0,An inefficient.
36353,PS2,6,127.0,127.6,0.6,5.0,Deliberation.
36353,PS2,6,128.36,129.36,1.0,5.0,So there are keywords.
36353,PS2,6,130.04,131.52,1.48,3.0,Some controlled cost.
36353,PS2,6,134.32,141.88,7.56,3.0,"For instance some medium men that will buy goods at this setting price from the manufacturer, then sells to orders."
36353,PS2,6,141.88,144.56,2.68,3.0,The retailers might buy it and then hike the price.
36353,PS2,6,144.72,156.36,11.64,3.0,"There is no control in the price that retailers sell to the consumers because they've already gotten it from the company, so it's not causing variation."
36353,PS2,6,156.96,158.36,1.4,3.0,Uncontrolled cost of.
36353,PS2,6,158.64,158.92,0.28,6.0,"That, yeah."
36353,PS2,6,158.92,163.16,4.24,6.0,"And I think we should, we should deal with uncontrolled, uncontrolled cost separately."
36353,PS2,6,163.16,167.16,4.0,6.0,"Yeah, well before talking about the insert, the inefficient delivery."
36353,PS2,6,167.2,167.52,0.32,1.0,Skills.
36353,PS2,6,168.36,170.0,1.64,6.0,Because they seem to be pointing.
36353,PS2,6,170.2,170.32,0.12,3.0,Time.
36353,PS2,6,170.4,171.2,0.8,3.0,We don't have time.
36353,PS2,6,172.4,187.96,15.56,6.0,"So for uncontrolled cost, I suggest for the the manufacturers should always keep in touch with the demand of the products and be able to produce as much as possible."
36353,PS2,6,188.48,198.84,10.36,6.0,"So, so they don't run into a situation where demand is more than supplies because that is the major thing that costs causes uncontrolled costs when the demand is higher than supply and."
36353,PS2,6,199.12,201.08,1.96,3.0,"People can hold those, I think what you said."
36353,PS2,6,201.16,201.64,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, sorry."
36353,PS2,6,202.04,209.2,7.16,1.0,"The, the issue here is we are looking at the challenges with supply that can affect that can make for a rise in price."
36353,PS2,6,209.2,216.0,6.8,1.0,"Because when there is depletion in supply, the question is there are there are company policies can delay supplies."
36353,PS2,6,216.44,221.72,5.28,1.0,"You may place an order to a company and it's not delivered in record time, then you have a shortfall in your in your stock."
36353,PS2,6,222.16,227.88,5.72,1.0,So what are ways we can effect efficient delivery of your order?
36353,PS2,6,228.08,230.04,1.96,3.0,"That is, I think they should remove."
36353,PS2,6,230.16,231.0,0.84,1.0,The middleman.
36353,PS2,6,231.6,235.52,3.92,3.0,Order from the company directly and the company delivers to you like Amazon.
36353,PS2,6,236.4,237.2,0.8,1.0,That's why I mentioned you.
36353,PS2,6,237.2,239.04,1.84,3.0,Guys like I was only all that day.
36353,PS2,6,239.04,240.84,1.8,3.0,There's no middle man in there.
36353,PS2,6,241.2,249.36,8.16,3.0,"But the person to say, OK, I'm buying from this company and I'm selling to the consumers is from the company down to the consumer."
36353,PS2,6,249.52,251.04,1.52,3.0,"So yes, middle."
36353,PS2,6,251.96,253.68,1.72,1.0,"Model yes, free flow to."
36353,PS2,6,254.72,267.48,12.76,3.0,"Regulating the cost because if you're buying if you're in Nigeria, buying on Amazon is same price depending on the currency if you're in US is same price but the delivery might be different but because the."
36353,PS2,6,267.72,272.12,4.4,6.0,Problem is we are still trying to manage the timely delivery.
36353,PS2,6,272.12,276.32,4.2,6.0,"If everybody is ordering from the company, the timely delivery will no longer be achieved."
36353,PS2,6,276.32,280.24,3.92,6.0,And this is the reason sometimes the middle is being put in place.
36353,PS2,6,280.24,290.0,9.76,6.0,"So I think rather the company, even if they're making use of middle men, they should be in control of the prices and and the middle men middle."
36353,PS2,6,290.0,292.48,2.48,1.0,Men is one option is one option.
36353,PS2,6,292.84,298.08,5.24,1.0,Then the second option I think is company policies to supply can also be adjusted.
36353,PS2,6,298.4,307.0,8.6,1.0,"Their companies should also, you know, make policies that affect efficient supply to to marketers directly."
36353,PS2,6,307.88,309.64,1.76,1.0,So that is one point we can be typing it.
36353,PS2,6,310.32,311.68,1.36,4.0,"Yeah, we can type in it."
36353,PS2,6,312.08,312.32,0.24,4.0,How?
36353,PS2,6,312.36,313.4,1.04,4.0,"Like how much, how much?"
36353,PS2,6,313.84,314.6,0.76,3.0,More time do.
36353,PS2,6,314.72,315.76,1.04,4.0,We want to have.
36353,PS2,6,316.36,317.4,1.04,1.0,6 minutes idea.
36353,PS2,6,317.4,318.16,0.76,2.0,How many words final?
36353,PS2,6,318.2,319.6,1.4,6.0,Idea right?
36353,PS2,6,319.6,322.84,3.24,6.0,I think we should choose one that will take care of all of these more creative.
36353,PS2,6,323.88,324.08,0.2,4.0,Ideas.
36353,PS2,6,324.16,325.76,1.6,4.0,"I feel like because it's like OK, finalize."
36353,PS2,6,326.68,328.76,2.08,5.0,Some keywords like what you're not writing.
36353,PS2,6,330.08,330.2,0.12,1.0,Like.
36353,PS2,6,331.08,331.8,0.72,5.0,What should we write?
36353,PS2,6,332.36,349.68,17.32,4.0,"I feel like because it's creative, I like, I don't know, I mean, in terms of at least the inefficiency of delivery, I feel like maybe if a consumer gets a product late, maybe the company could provide like an addition."
36353,PS2,6,349.68,352.4,2.72,4.0,"Yeah, a compensation, a product that they couldn't sell."
36353,PS2,6,353.16,353.8,0.64,4.0,"I mean, it's."
36353,PS2,6,353.92,356.48,2.56,4.0,"I don't know if it's doable, but at least it's created."
36353,PS2,6,356.52,360.24,3.72,3.0,It's different to the company to be on their toes to deliver.
36353,PS2,6,360.28,361.68,1.4,4.0,In time exactly because they.
36353,PS2,6,361.88,362.32,0.44,3.0,Have loss.
36353,PS2,6,363.12,363.72,0.6,4.0,Exactly.
36353,PS2,6,363.72,365.8,2.08,3.0,Because of the compensation does that does.
36353,PS2,6,365.84,368.56,2.72,2.0,Account as tackling supply chain security.
36353,PS2,6,368.72,369.68,0.96,4.0,"I mean, it's creative."
36353,PS2,6,369.72,373.24,3.52,4.0,"It's like logistically maybe not doable, but at least it's."
36353,PS2,6,374.08,377.04,2.96,2.0,"Yeah, but my only, my only thing is like it's please come up."
36353,PS2,6,377.44,377.56,0.12,5.0,With.
36353,PS2,6,380.76,381.84,1.08,3.0,So what should I say?
36353,PS2,6,382.08,382.96,0.88,6.0,One creative idea.
36353,PS2,6,382.96,384.52,1.56,6.0,So that was supply.
36353,PS2,6,384.6,385.68,1.08,3.0,Compensation.
36353,PS2,6,386.16,387.08,0.92,4.0,From the company.
36353,PS2,6,387.08,387.4,0.32,3.0,Who?
36353,PS2,6,387.8,390.28,2.48,4.0,Who was late in delivering products to the company?
36353,PS2,6,394.04,401.6,7.56,6.0,Another suggestion that I would love for us to look at is what if the company creates a software?
36353,PS2,6,401.8,401.84,0.04,1.0,A.
36353,PS2,6,402.76,423.4,20.64,6.0,"Software that even if they are using the domain distributors for sellers or whatever it is, but the the software activity will be a tracking system to be to be able to say we have products we have to support products in that case in the minutes of any product by they ensure that."
36353,PS2,6,423.52,425.52,2.0,1.0,Compensation policies by companies for.
36353,PS2,6,426.8,427.16,0.36,3.0,For late.
36353,PS2,6,427.24,427.64,0.4,6.0,General.
36353,PS2,6,429.24,431.56,2.32,1.0,"Sellers, everybody suspend."
36353,PS2,6,433.2,435.52,2.32,3.0,Compensation policy from the company.
36353,PS2,6,437.16,437.28,0.12,6.0,For.
36353,PS2,6,437.6,438.2,0.6,1.0,The company.
36353,PS2,6,442.8,443.12,0.32,4.0,Delivery.
36353,PS2,6,444.48,445.16,0.68,3.0,Delivery.
36353,PS2,6,453.64,455.28,1.64,1.0,Or maybe distributors orders?
36353,PS2,6,456.08,457.92,1.84,3.0,Orders eliminating middle men.
36353,PS2,6,457.92,460.28,2.36,3.0,That's what I'm saying.
36353,PS2,6,460.28,463.56,3.28,3.0,Middle men uncontrolled price cost.
36353,PS2,6,464.2,470.84,6.64,6.0,"No, I I think rather the company should have a particular software that controls both their middle men, both their."
36353,PS2,6,471.72,474.16,2.44,3.0,"In supply chain, you can't control the middle men."
36353,PS2,6,474.48,475.0,0.52,6.0,You can.
36353,PS2,6,475.0,479.48,4.48,6.0,There are products that everybody sells the same prices because of the price.
36353,PS2,6,479.48,482.08,2.6,6.0,"No, they just give a little discount to the."
36353,PS2,6,482.08,482.68,0.6,6.0,Is it?
36353,PS2,6,482.76,483.56,0.8,1.0,Possible to say that there are?
36353,PS2,6,484.04,487.2,3.16,6.0,"There are products that everybody knows the same price, sells the same price."
36353,PS2,6,487.6,487.8,0.2,6.0,Is it?
36353,PS2,6,487.84,488.2,0.36,1.0,Possible.
36353,PS2,6,489.04,491.76,2.72,3.0,To say a particular product for the same price all over.
36353,PS2,6,491.88,492.88,1.0,6.0,"Yes, there."
36353,PS2,6,492.96,496.64,3.68,3.0,Is no possible there are individuals have their own cost of.
36353,PS2,6,496.96,497.04,0.08,1.0,The.
36353,PS2,6,497.56,497.76,0.2,6.0,Beauty.
36353,PS2,6,504.6,505.08,0.48,2.0,This is right.
36353,PS2,6,505.08,506.2,1.12,2.0,"Yeah, I think basically we can."
36353,PS2,6,506.4,506.6,0.2,2.0,We can.
36353,PS2,6,506.6,506.88,0.28,1.0,Expand.
36353,PS2,6,507.24,509.08,1.84,2.0,But they're like very contagious face to pass.
36353,PS2,6,509.12,513.92,4.8,2.0,"OK, That's why it looks like coffee to you customers."
36353,PS2,6,513.92,514.12,0.2,2.0,"Yeah, is."
36353,PS2,6,514.12,514.88,0.76,1.0,It understood like.
36353,PS2,6,517.64,523.64,6.0,3.0,"This and this one might tackle in inefficient delivery, but what does uncontrolled cost the?"
36353,PS2,6,524.04,527.64,3.6,1.0,Uncontrolled cost comes because there is deficit in supply.
36353,PS2,6,527.64,529.04,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, then they can, you understand."
36353,PS2,6,529.04,531.84,2.8,1.0,"So once there's efficient supply, the price will drop."
36353,PS2,6,532.44,535.48,3.04,1.0,"When you have fewer stock, you rise the price because you know the company."
36353,PS2,6,535.48,540.88,5.4,3.0,"Will not deliver, intentionally raise the cost because number one of the environment."
36353,PS2,6,540.88,541.44,0.56,1.0,Because one.
36353,PS2,6,541.76,550.76,9.0,3.0,"The environment, not only because of that commodity, the environment they are in, the rent they pay, you get the kind of a defect they."
36353,PS2,6,550.76,553.84,3.08,1.0,"Are in, but such ones are controlled with competitors."
36353,PS2,6,554.04,559.96,5.92,1.0,"If there are competitors in that environment and they have efficient supply, they will bring down the price of that commodity."
36353,PS2,6,560.52,567.92,7.4,1.0,"But if there are two organizations starting the same program and there's no supply to each of them, they will the price will definitely go because they will have it's discussed."
36353,PS2,6,567.96,568.8,0.84,3.0,So I should sum.
36353,PS2,6,568.96,569.36,0.4,1.0,So I.
36353,PS2,6,570.8,571.8,1.0,3.0,Should sum it OK.
36353,PS2,6,572.0,573.24,1.24,3.0,What counts then?
36353,PS2,6,575.36,576.44,1.08,3.0,What counts then?
36353,PS2,6,579.16,579.28,0.12,1.0,OK.
36353,PS2,6,580.84,582.84,2.0,3.0,I should so I should do next.
36353,PS2,6,583.4,584.04,0.64,3.0,Is that OK?
36353,PS2,6,584.24,588.0,3.76,3.0,Compensation policy from the company for late delivery of orders?
36353,PS2,6,588.64,590.44,1.8,5.0,And how about early deliveries sometimes?
36353,PS2,6,592.04,594.08,2.04,1.0,They can't compensate you when they are delivering.
36353,PS2,6,595.84,599.4,3.56,3.0,"You will be more than 10, so I should, yes."
36175,PS4,3,8.52,11.2,2.68,1.0,"OK, great idea."
36175,PS4,3,14.56,17.64,3.08,1.0,"I mean, I guess this is a similar issue of like who who is doing this?"
36175,PS4,3,17.64,18.48,0.84,1.0,Is it the government?
36175,PS4,3,18.48,21.0,2.52,1.0,Is it an individual school?
36175,PS4,3,21.0,24.76,3.76,1.0,"Is it, is it like charities?"
36175,PS4,3,26.84,27.72,0.88,1.0,So I guess it's up to us.
36175,PS4,3,38.32,51.2,12.88,2.0,"This is 1 level wish to make the like the admission requirements for marginalized groups looser than compared to other people, so it's more easy for them to get in the good universities schools, but."
36175,PS4,3,51.64,55.0,3.36,3.0,Is that sort of like unfair to people who have?
36175,PS4,3,55.28,56.96,1.68,2.0,"Like they are, yeah."
36175,PS4,3,56.96,59.28,2.32,2.0,"But yeah, it's unfair, really."
36175,PS4,3,59.96,60.72,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, trying to."
36175,PS4,3,60.72,62.96,2.24,2.0,Balance two of them up under this much.
36175,PS4,3,63.84,68.0,4.16,3.0,I was thinking to like not not to change.
36175,PS4,3,68.0,76.72,8.72,3.0,"No, no, no, like because now like the educational resources are all concentrated in these few, few schools."
36175,PS4,3,76.72,99.32,22.6,3.0,"So that's like elitist to sort of like democratise it so that more schools enjoy educational resources instead of like, because if it's just like ensuring that disadvantaged students can get into the good school, then there are always going to be students who can't get into a good school."
36175,PS4,3,99.88,107.04,7.16,3.0,"Or maybe like expanding it, making like, you know, like maybe Cambridge is like this head company and we have like."
36175,PS4,3,107.56,107.76,0.2,2.0,You know.
36175,PS4,3,108.16,111.44,3.28,3.0,"Cambridge, Oxford Division and Cambridge, etcetera, benches."
36175,PS4,3,112.44,117.36,4.92,1.0,"Like, are we, are we, are we thinking about this all in terms of university education?"
36175,PS4,3,117.36,118.44,1.08,3.0,"Or yeah, it could."
36175,PS4,3,118.64,121.44,2.8,1.0,Be but I was in that define but I was wondering.
36175,PS4,3,122.76,124.64,1.88,1.0,"But I think that's a good, that's interesting point."
36175,PS4,3,125.56,126.72,1.16,3.0,Academic resource.
36175,PS4,3,130.0,137.92,7.92,1.0,So like an so an example of education inequality and like maybe more like high school would be like access to things like tutoring.
36175,PS4,3,139.56,147.24,7.68,1.0,"So like wealthy people can afford to get like private treated this whereas I've I mean, I've I've treated myself saying others works."
36175,PS4,3,148.2,155.04,6.84,1.0,"Whereas like, yeah, poor people who disfuncted marginalized groups that don't have access to the same."
36175,PS4,3,155.04,158.32,3.28,1.0,"Yeah, but we solve that problem."
36175,PS4,3,159.92,160.48,0.56,1.0,But how?
36175,PS4,3,160.56,160.8,0.24,1.0,How?
36175,PS4,3,161.32,162.4,1.08,3.0,Would we solve that problem?
36175,PS4,3,163.04,163.68,0.64,1.0,"Well, there's lots."
36175,PS4,3,163.72,165.0,1.28,1.0,"Well, I've been involved with a few things."
36175,PS4,3,165.0,177.52,12.52,1.0,"So like during the pandemic, the COVID pandemic, I volunteered for like a charity that was providing free tuition to people that couldn't afford tuition, which country here in the UK."
36175,PS4,3,179.4,189.48,10.08,1.0,So that was an example of an initiative that was like student organised that I imagine was probably good at addressing this kind of thing.
36175,PS4,3,189.48,190.28,0.8,1.0,But I don't know.
36175,PS4,3,190.72,192.84,2.12,1.0,But that's an existing.
36175,PS4,3,193.28,194.48,1.2,1.0,That's not us being created though.
36175,PS4,3,196.32,198.12,1.8,3.0,Is that like long term?
36175,PS4,3,198.12,204.44,6.32,1.0,Or like that was just during the COVID pandemic.
36175,PS4,3,204.92,215.92,11.0,1.0,"So like specifically because of when people went in school, wealthy people could access online tutoring to like make up for the fact they went in school, whereas other students don't."
36175,PS4,3,215.92,219.6,3.68,2.0,Have access to they were to offer regular in person tutoring to those students for.
36175,PS4,3,219.72,219.84,0.12,1.0,Free.
36175,PS4,3,220.16,222.96,2.8,1.0,"Yeah, I think the I think Labour, I think the government here is."
36175,PS4,3,222.96,223.12,0.16,1.0,Do you?
36175,PS4,3,223.28,224.24,0.96,2.0,Have this kind of day.
36175,PS4,3,227.08,232.16,5.08,1.0,"Somewhere, some somewhere, something, someone offering like 1 to 1 support for anyone."
36175,PS4,3,232.2,237.04,4.84,1.0,Like I think schools already like some schools already do this kind of thing.
36175,PS4,3,239.56,242.12,2.56,1.0,"But yeah, having some kind of national programme people I."
36175,PS4,3,243.6,246.76,3.16,3.0,Was thinking like partnerships like 1 to 1 partnerships it's.
36175,PS4,3,247.0,248.2,1.2,2.0,Let's go to a slash school.
36175,PS4,3,248.96,254.56,5.6,3.0,"With that, or it could be like one person to another person, like buddy buddies, study buddies."
36175,PS4,3,255.6,255.84,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36175,PS4,3,256.36,259.76,3.4,1.0,So like doing that within a school or broader?
36175,PS4,3,262.92,270.44,7.52,3.0,"It could be across any, it could be even be from different countries."
36175,PS4,3,274.24,282.72,8.48,1.0,Would it be with someone who's like is it Sally Buddy is in the sense of you both like peers like at the same level or or it's more of a mentoring probably.
36175,PS4,3,283.84,284.84,1.0,2.0,At the same level as well.
36175,PS4,3,285.6,288.2,2.6,2.0,"So at the same time, talk about anything, everything."
36175,PS4,3,288.84,289.28,0.44,3.0,Could be any.
36175,PS4,3,290.52,292.68,2.16,1.0,Then how would that be?
36175,PS4,3,296.16,299.52,3.36,2.0,More or less to share the resources from the good student.
36175,PS4,3,299.52,302.76,3.24,2.0,"Not good, but I mean the education like books."
36175,PS4,3,302.8,303.2,0.4,3.0,Or the.
36175,PS4,3,303.88,307.72,3.84,2.0,Natural sites or whatever to the students from all these monitored groups.
36175,PS4,3,309.16,314.4,5.24,1.0,So the like the I I won't be paid duty have like a disadvantaged student or advanced student together.
36175,PS4,3,316.64,319.88,3.24,2.0,"Thank you, I do so much about how to describe."
36175,PS4,3,324.28,336.52,12.24,1.0,"So Star Trek, Tim, you can edit after some bloody system where you said."
36175,PS4,3,343.36,355.92,12.56,3.0,"And I think like, this could somehow contribute to like extra curricular charity work for like, so they have like this incentive to do it."
36175,PS4,3,356.68,360.36,3.68,1.0,This is I feel like if I was a student I wouldn't be interested in this.
36175,PS4,3,360.56,360.76,0.2,3.0,No.
36175,PS4,3,362.04,363.92,1.88,1.0,"Why it seems like pity, I don't know."
36175,PS4,3,363.92,366.48,2.56,1.0,It's like this person's not qualified to actually help you.
36175,PS4,3,367.16,368.52,1.36,2.0,Just like a French to talk to.
36175,PS4,3,368.52,369.48,0.96,1.0,Share You've got friends.
36175,PS4,3,369.48,371.0,1.52,1.0,You've already got friends that you relate.
36175,PS4,3,371.0,373.48,2.48,1.0,You don't want to relate to this person either because you've got very different.
36175,PS4,3,373.8,383.56,9.76,2.0,"Backgrounds establish get some resources from his or her university or schools, collect your sites or."
36175,PS4,3,388.12,388.36,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36175,PS4,3,396.64,397.24,0.6,1.0,We can just go.
36175,PS4,3,397.32,398.48,1.16,1.0,I'm happy to go for it it.
36175,PS4,3,400.32,403.8,3.48,3.0,"It could also be like implementing teacher training, yeah."
36175,PS4,3,404.44,405.16,0.72,1.0,For regions.
36175,PS4,3,405.76,406.8,1.04,3.0,So like there are more.
36175,PS4,3,406.88,407.44,0.56,1.0,Features.
36175,PS4,3,407.64,409.32,1.68,3.0,"Yeah, we're on that side."
36175,PS4,3,410.0,421.84,11.84,1.0,"So we'll leave this one there for now, but you can see you're seeing funding mechanisms, no?"
36175,PS4,3,424.24,428.68,4.44,3.0,"No, it's just like that."
36175,PS4,3,428.68,430.68,2.0,3.0,That is so reorganising funding.
36175,PS4,3,431.64,433.8,2.16,3.0,It just sounds so like Grant.
36175,PS4,3,434.68,435.28,0.6,1.0,So what grant?
36175,PS4,3,435.44,436.16,0.72,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36175,PS4,3,436.44,436.6,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
36175,PS4,3,436.6,438.12,1.52,1.0,"Well, it's this is a bigger scale."
36175,PS4,3,439.16,443.36,4.2,1.0,This is trying to deal with more of the systemic issues so that.
36175,PS4,3,473.93,496.0,22.07,1.0,"And again, this is Phil, similar to the one before where it's like, this isn't, this is like, I think this is the solution, but it's not a very great solution, but like just paying people more like, you know, like it's like, yeah, this is what needs to happen if we can earn a bit together."
36175,PS4,3,500.56,502.12,1.56,1.0,"And yeah, should we see that?"
36175,PS4,3,503.32,504.44,1.12,1.0,Anyone got any other ideas?
36225,PS2,6,16.22,18.22,2.0,1.0,I know nothing about supply chains to be honest.
36225,PS2,6,18.82,19.98,1.16,2.0,Do you mind to type?
36225,PS2,6,19.98,20.82,0.84,2.0,"Sure, sure, sure."
36225,PS2,6,20.98,22.38,1.4,2.0,Because I got some no?
36225,PS2,6,23.02,23.3,0.28,3.0,Chains.
36225,PS2,6,23.3,25.74,2.44,3.0,"OK, say OK, this jumper, where is it coming from?"
36225,PS2,6,26.06,26.22,0.16,4.0,Right.
36225,PS2,6,26.38,27.02,0.64,4.0,"Yeah, start."
36225,PS2,6,27.02,32.14,5.12,3.0,"From making the fabric, right, making the cotton and that will be somewhere."
36225,PS2,6,32.6,42.08,9.48,3.0,"And first of all, you produce the material to rate, make the garments, make the material first, then make the garments, then ship it to the destination."
36225,PS2,6,42.16,43.24,1.08,3.0,So that's the whole supply chain.
36225,PS2,6,43.24,48.12,4.88,3.0,And then finally end up in the shop and then you buy it all you can get it from online.
36225,PS2,6,48.64,50.12,1.48,3.0,And so that's that's the whole supply.
36225,PS2,6,50.2,50.4,0.2,1.0,Right.
36225,PS2,6,50.4,55.92,5.52,1.0,"So you're trained like, you're basically trying to trace like the actors involved in like the making of a product."
36225,PS2,6,55.92,60.24,4.32,3.0,"Specifically, yeah, OK, let's just use a job for, for example."
36225,PS2,6,60.24,63.8,3.56,3.0,So that's supply chain and the vulnerabilities within the supply chain and.
36225,PS2,6,66.0,71.32,5.32,5.0,"So I guess the in the existing situation, you don't necessarily actually know what the full supply chain is."
36225,PS2,6,71.36,77.48,6.12,5.0,"You just like like each, each actor in the supply chain just knows what they need to produce what they're producing and they know who they're sending it to you."
36225,PS2,6,77.48,78.88,1.4,5.0,They don't necessarily know about the rest of the.
36225,PS2,6,79.48,80.04,0.56,3.0,Supply chain.
36225,PS2,6,80.12,83.88,3.76,5.0,"Supply chain, so that could be one solution to change right now, a bit more integrated somehow."
36225,PS2,6,84.4,84.56,0.16,2.0,Right.
36225,PS2,6,87.12,90.52,3.4,3.0,"It can be very costly because it shipped all over the world, right?"
36225,PS2,6,90.52,92.6,2.08,3.0,And they can be very inefficient.
36225,PS2,6,93.52,94.28,0.76,3.0,It's all over the place.
36225,PS2,6,94.72,98.48,3.76,3.0,"But the easiest way, of course a lot of people talking about is reduce the supply chain."
36225,PS2,6,99.4,100.4,1.0,6.0,That's what I was thinking.
36225,PS2,6,100.4,105.32,4.92,3.0,"You can make stuff locally and use it, but that's not a creative way."
36225,PS2,6,106.32,107.4,1.08,6.0,"I don't know that feels, but let's."
36225,PS2,6,108.48,109.0,0.52,3.0,Write it down.
36225,PS2,6,109.08,110.04,0.96,6.0,"For magnetic, yeah, I did."
36225,PS2,6,110.2,115.4,5.2,5.0,This last time that the question you kept having was that that was often like a very obvious answer.
36225,PS2,6,115.56,121.76,6.2,5.0,"Is it like the practice the correct answer that the answer that probably needs to happen, but then is it like creative?"
36225,PS2,6,124.28,124.92,0.64,3.0,Or simplified.
36225,PS2,6,125.12,125.6,0.48,3.0,Exactly.
36225,PS2,6,125.84,128.08,2.24,3.0,And of course the topic is on security.
36225,PS2,6,128.96,132.44,3.48,3.0,"So it's not about efficiency or cost, it's on security."
36225,PS2,6,133.64,133.84,0.2,1.0,Right.
36225,PS2,6,133.84,139.68,5.84,1.0,"So that's like less risks or like less, I don't know, like unexpected."
36225,PS2,6,139.68,150.96,11.28,3.0,"Costs, yeah, well for example shipment can be lost, right, OK one example is a huge container contains a lot of products and ship all the way to England and it's lost in the sea that's a that's a security issue."
36225,PS2,6,151.4,154.12,2.72,3.0,Our system can be hacked at a cyber security issue do.
36225,PS2,6,154.48,159.72,5.24,5.0,You think they mean security like that kind of security which means kind of consistency or like?
36225,PS2,6,160.24,164.36,4.12,3.0,"I think it didn't say anything so that we can use our creativity to run wild, right?"
36225,PS2,6,164.6,166.04,1.44,3.0,"Yeah, so."
36225,PS2,6,166.52,169.96,3.44,3.0,"And when we talk about security, what do you think about what's for singing ahead?"
36225,PS2,6,170.0,171.72,1.72,1.0,"Well, there it says vulnerabilities."
36225,PS2,6,171.72,176.24,4.52,1.0,So like I guess a good approach would be to identify like what potential vulnerabilities there are.
36225,PS2,6,177.68,188.96,11.28,3.0,"Well, the established vulnerability, it could be usually the lower down the supply chain, usually these people get very low wages and then they are being exploited and the working condition is terrible."
36225,PS2,6,188.96,190.16,1.2,3.0,That's the vulnerability there.
36225,PS2,6,190.48,192.56,2.08,3.0,And the other vulnerability is to our environment.
36225,PS2,6,192.92,203.28,10.36,3.0,That's a big one because they got so many parties involved and hugely inefficient because it's a lot of multi parties involved.
36225,PS2,6,203.48,203.88,0.4,6.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,204.44,211.2,6.76,5.0,"If it's also like if it's if we're talking in terms of like food, food splashes and those environmental so like."
36225,PS2,6,213.16,213.4,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,213.72,220.28,6.56,6.0,"There's like a theme happening of like sustainability and that's right, equity and kind of those types of conversations."
36225,PS2,6,221.2,222.48,1.28,6.0,"Yeah, So I'm not."
36225,PS2,6,222.92,223.04,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,223.52,231.88,8.36,1.0,"Also, it could be like improving like just the security of the location where that like specific like part of the supply chain is happening."
36225,PS2,6,231.88,241.48,9.6,1.0,"So for example with like, for example, like if you want to make like a cotton or T-shirt like, you want to make sure that say like cotton plantations are like."
36225,PS2,6,241.76,243.24,1.48,3.0,Safe for workers?
36225,PS2,6,243.56,243.96,0.4,1.0,For like.
36225,PS2,6,244.28,245.56,1.28,3.0,Everyone who's working there.
36225,PS2,6,246.0,246.44,0.44,6.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36225,PS2,6,246.8,248.6,1.8,3.0,So that's one part of the vulnerability.
36225,PS2,6,248.6,252.24,3.64,3.0,"And also from now, from a client's point of view, they also feel vulnerable."
36225,PS2,6,252.24,259.52,7.28,3.0,"Sometimes it's because you give a sum of money to a certain country that you have no idea, don't speak the language, don't know any system."
36225,PS2,6,259.52,266.92,7.4,3.0,"But what, what, what if at the end they don't give you anything or they give you the product that's not good quality, That's also another vulnerability."
36225,PS2,6,267.6,271.72,4.12,3.0,"And they want to make sure the whatever they buy, it will be delivered to them."
36225,PS2,6,273.24,275.32,2.08,3.0,"Well, that's about the security border ability issue I."
36225,PS2,6,275.92,279.0,3.08,5.0,Think in general because they're talking about like delivery schedules and that kind.
36225,PS2,6,279.28,279.92,0.64,6.0,"Of thing, yeah, like."
36225,PS2,6,280.04,284.24,4.2,5.0,I said that the focus they're running on like the logistical.
36225,PS2,6,284.4,284.64,0.24,2.0,Right.
36225,PS2,6,285.28,285.52,0.24,2.0,"Yeah, but."
36225,PS2,6,285.76,286.12,0.36,5.0,"It's you, but."
36225,PS2,6,286.68,299.44,12.76,2.0,"Yeah, you know some diversity diversify the supply train 'cause sometimes like some locations may got some problems delivered to problems so like accomplished."
36225,PS2,6,300.44,308.84,8.4,6.0,"Yeah, That kind of makes me think about the sustainability thing that's been brought up is like, this sounds really fun a lot."
36225,PS2,6,308.84,313.08,4.24,6.0,"But like producing locally, supplying locally is way less riskier."
36225,PS2,6,313.84,321.36,7.52,6.0,"So if we're just going to be like, money is not an option and we're not trying to exploit people, then if we take that realm out of it, right?"
36225,PS2,6,321.36,328.28,6.92,6.0,"And we say, we say like, I'm not, you see, I'm also getting hung up on the word creativity."
36225,PS2,6,328.28,343.4,15.12,6.0,"So I'm, I think that's probably my issue that I'm struggling because to me it just seems like exactly what you said is like this kind of more localised means of product like manufacturing."
36225,PS2,6,343.4,350.04,6.64,6.0,So that to me stands out as something that could address vulnerabilities potentially in more ways than one.
36225,PS2,6,350.4,352.8,2.4,6.0,But is it creative or not sure?
36225,PS2,6,353.52,360.8,7.28,1.0,"But that's really helpful though, because like at least like by focusing on like the local, we can at least like decide like at what scale we're deploying."
36225,PS2,6,361.04,361.4,0.36,6.0,The idea?
36225,PS2,6,362.6,367.64,5.04,3.0,"Like there's a lot of campaign on the local produce, local consumption of these things."
36225,PS2,6,367.72,371.24,3.52,3.0,"You probably see it in the supermarkets and local British food, right, OK."
36225,PS2,6,371.8,373.08,1.28,3.0,And local produce or whatever.
36225,PS2,6,373.12,376.56,3.44,3.0,And you what you find interesting is those products are typically more expensive.
36225,PS2,6,378.16,379.2,1.04,6.0,"It's because, yeah."
36225,PS2,6,379.72,379.92,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,381.2,383.72,2.52,6.0,It's cheap to exploit people and to it's cheaper.
36225,PS2,6,383.72,387.6,3.88,3.0,"To be exploitative, I think it's the division of labour, it's the, it's the Adam Smith."
36225,PS2,6,388.16,388.68,0.52,6.0,"Yeah, sure."
36225,PS2,6,389.44,399.88,10.44,3.0,"Serious, if you're focused on one area of production and the the economy of scale of whole production of humanity is a lot faster."
36225,PS2,6,400.44,406.68,6.24,3.0,"So if I do everything, you do everything, it's not as efficient as saying I'm just going to make garments and you're just going to make stitches."
36225,PS2,6,407.28,412.16,4.88,3.0,"And then between the six of us, it's way more efficient than every single one of us do everything."
36225,PS2,6,412.68,414.84,2.16,3.0,So that's the whole idea of different countries and different.
36225,PS2,6,415.84,420.64,4.8,3.0,"Yeah, OK, I'm just going to put it out there."
36225,PS2,6,420.68,430.24,9.56,3.0,"One of the creative way of security is a self accountability, which is like the trust and accountability of it and then becomes the security."
36225,PS2,6,430.24,438.28,8.04,3.0,It's usually when a lot of these things come in like a client is worried about their product will be lost and whatever.
36225,PS2,6,438.28,442.88,4.6,3.0,It's because every part of the supply chain do not have accountability of the whole supply chain.
36225,PS2,6,443.6,445.56,1.96,3.0,But I'm just going to take care of this little bit.
36225,PS2,6,445.56,446.76,1.2,3.0,I don't care about anything else.
36225,PS2,6,447.68,455.68,8.0,3.0,But if we put that trust and accountability on everybody and then that won't be less of the security concern.
36225,PS2,6,456.08,462.88,6.8,1.0,"And increase like, transparency as well, like these actors deserve to know like what happens to their product after they're involved as well."
36225,PS2,6,463.2,464.48,1.28,3.0,Just like put you on a statement.
36225,PS2,6,464.56,464.84,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,465.24,470.36,5.12,3.0,"So self involvement, accountability I guess you know, that's I'm not sure what they will work on."
36225,PS2,6,470.72,471.76,1.04,5.0,"Yeah, I'm happy to go ahead of that."
36225,PS2,6,471.76,477.88,6.12,5.0,"I mean, I I don't know how that would Have you have any ideas how how that would work in practice?"
36225,PS2,6,479.88,484.2,4.32,3.0,"OK, say, you know, maybe making a jumper again, for example."
36225,PS2,6,484.2,488.68,4.48,3.0,"So if if I make the garments and you make stitches and then you put the button on it and then blah, blah."
36225,PS2,6,488.68,490.48,1.8,3.0,"And I don't care, I'm just going to put the button."
36225,PS2,6,490.76,497.4,6.64,3.0,"So even though we don't need the button anymore, but I don't care about anything else that's adding the security problems and vulnerability in it."
36225,PS2,6,497.4,504.68,7.28,3.0,"But then if you can see the whole, if you have your stick in it, you have your own, I don't know, 5% of the company."
36225,PS2,6,505.16,506.88,1.72,3.0,And then you care about it more.
36225,PS2,6,507.4,511.16,3.76,3.0,"So that makes like, wait a minute, I don't need more buttons or I actually do."
36225,PS2,6,511.2,512.64,1.44,3.0,So they kind of raise pants a lot quicker.
36225,PS2,6,513.6,521.88,8.28,5.0,"So the I guess summary would be like improving supply chain transparency and then because you to do what you wanted to do, you need to have."
36225,PS2,6,521.92,522.52,0.6,3.0,Transparency.
36225,PS2,6,522.52,527.0,4.48,3.0,"Well, I'm actually thinking about giving everybody a stock a share of the company."
36225,PS2,6,527.4,527.52,0.12,6.0,Sure.
36225,PS2,6,528.48,544.48,16.0,3.0,"Whatever supply chain is, you know, so making close as an example again, so for your close production line, so even for the the lowest the supply chain, that person probably can't even read it right and all of that they own 0.01% of the company."
36225,PS2,6,544.8,545.08,0.28,5.0,The the the.
36225,PS2,6,546.24,547.36,1.12,3.0,The one that makes closing the.
36225,PS2,6,547.36,548.92,1.56,5.0,"Company, yeah, the final, yes, yeah."
36225,PS2,6,549.76,552.64,2.88,3.0,Until they become becomes more accountable.
36225,PS2,6,552.68,556.2,3.52,3.0,So if it works well and then I will have better profit.
36225,PS2,6,556.8,558.56,1.76,6.0,I just want to be cognizant of time.
36225,PS2,6,559.28,560.08,0.8,3.0,2 minutes left.
36225,PS2,6,560.12,560.56,0.44,6.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,561.08,565.72,4.64,6.0,So I'm I'm not sure how to turn this into one creative idea.
36225,PS2,6,566.48,578.96,12.48,4.0,How I'd like to just let a party to monitor the whole the every like transport processes like from one supply to the level 1 just let the party to monitor this process would.
36225,PS2,6,579.24,580.32,1.08,1.0,You like to watch down?
36225,PS2,6,580.32,580.88,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36225,PS2,6,581.16,586.4,5.24,4.0,So the the their job is just to modify the process of the transport so that.
36225,PS2,6,586.6,588.28,1.68,3.0,So you're talking about hiring?
36225,PS2,6,588.32,588.96,0.64,4.0,Policing.
36225,PS2,6,588.96,589.08,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,589.32,590.44,1.12,4.0,"Yeah, it's like that."
36225,PS2,6,590.44,593.68,3.24,3.0,But the policing that's usually increase a huge amount of cost.
36225,PS2,6,593.68,598.12,4.44,3.0,"They're creating us and then that a lot more friction and exploitation of the moment though, right?"
36225,PS2,6,598.32,600.08,1.76,4.0,"Yeah, it's, it has the right."
36225,PS2,6,600.32,601.12,0.8,4.0,I think it has the.
36225,PS2,6,601.44,602.28,0.84,3.0,Controversial about the.
36225,PS2,6,602.68,605.16,2.48,4.0,"Increasing the cost, but also I think it's."
36225,PS2,6,605.72,606.24,0.52,3.0,A very.
36225,PS2,6,606.68,609.08,2.4,4.0,Kind of like secure to a.
36225,PS2,6,609.68,612.52,2.84,3.0,Secure way of increase the tests are safe.
36225,PS2,6,613.88,614.0,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,614.28,618.72,4.44,1.0,"So I mean, of course there are going to be costs like in, you know, like increasing policing."
36225,PS2,6,618.76,625.56,6.8,1.0,"But I guess in the long term, like if you wait, like will it, it might actually decrease these like uncontrolled costs."
36225,PS2,6,626.56,627.0,0.44,1.0,I I don't.
36225,PS2,6,628.72,631.92,3.2,3.0,Know OK we've got one minute when I have minutes left so do we go for it I.
36225,PS2,6,632.04,635.2,3.16,5.0,Just gave it generic trying to improve.
36225,PS2,6,636.16,636.52,0.36,6.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,637.4,638.24,0.84,3.0,Do we go for trade?
36225,PS2,6,638.28,640.0,1.72,5.0,More hostility across the spike chain.
36225,PS2,6,640.44,640.6,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
36225,PS2,6,640.6,646.16,5.56,3.0,"Do we go for transparency or more policing, enforcement or share of the company?"
36225,PS2,6,647.32,648.64,1.32,6.0,"I think we can say, Oh, no, yeah."
36225,PS2,6,648.68,650.64,1.96,3.0,"Because they all, yeah, might as well just put divers in."
36225,PS2,6,650.68,651.84,1.16,6.0,"Here OK, so how would I say that?"
36225,PS2,6,651.84,652.68,0.84,6.0,I would say.
36225,PS2,6,652.68,654.64,1.96,3.0,Number one option improve transparency.
36225,PS2,6,657.84,659.76,1.92,3.0,Number two option ground.
36225,PS2,6,660.72,661.8,1.08,1.0,Increase policing.
36225,PS2,6,663.44,667.6,4.16,3.0,"You know, I was thinking about second option is ground company ownership."
36225,PS2,6,668.44,668.64,0.2,2.0,OK.
36225,PS2,6,669.12,672.68,3.56,3.0,Good grant company ownership as percentage doesn't matter how small I.
36225,PS2,6,672.84,673.24,0.4,4.0,Think that's.
36225,PS2,6,673.28,674.32,1.04,1.0,The most creative?
36225,PS2,6,674.84,675.4,0.56,3.0,"One you need, really."
36225,PS2,6,675.92,677.28,1.36,3.0,"Yeah, it's just."

36225,PS2,6,679.08,679.56,0.48,6.0,Ownership it.
36225,PS2,6,680.32,685.84,5.52,3.0,Could be just you could put a bracket that is 0.001% of whatever but you.
36225,PS2,6,685.92,687.04,1.12,6.0,Know to incentivize.
36225,PS2,6,687.8,687.92,0.12,3.0,Yeah.

36225,PS2,6,700.24,701.84,1.6,3.0,And let's put everything down.
36225,PS2,6,701.92,709.52,7.6,3.0,"So the option is your idea of increasing policing, policing enforcement increase."
36225,PS2,6,709.52,709.76,0.24,3.0,"OK, and."
36225,PS2,6,713.88,715.84,1.96,6.0,"Then I'm about 6 seconds, OK, and what else?"

34420,PS5,6,1020.44,1029.52,9.08,1.0,"I think we can answer this in a smarter way by starting with what you said and then involving every, including everybody's ideas as basically backup to what you said."
34420,PS5,6,1029.8,1038.76,8.96,1.0,"You know, so we would encourage making employees exact words that you said I."

34420,PS5,6,1220.72,1221.68,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, that's very good."
34420,PS5,6,1221.68,1222.08,0.4,1.0,Thank you.
34420,PS5,6,1225.04,1228.2,3.16,1.0,You said something about making it feel like a community.
34420,PS5,6,1228.24,1234.64,6.4,3.0,"Like bringing people together, I don't know, some kind of like bonding activities at work, they have like away days and stuff."
34420,PS5,6,1235.2,1235.4,0.2,1.0,OK.
34420,PS5,6,1236.48,1236.76,0.28,1.0,OK.
34420,PS5,6,1237.0,1241.24,4.24,1.0,"For away days for team, team and community."
34420,PS5,6,1244.84,1245.08,0.24,1.0,OK.
34420,PS5,6,1245.68,1250.16,4.48,1.0,Does it all fit under sense of purpose and belonging or should we say also like support or I don't know.
34420,PS5,6,1255.36,1258.16,2.8,1.0,"Yeah, I was really talking about like since 1:00 and 2:00."
34420,PS5,6,1259.6,1272.64,13.04,1.0,"Do we need all of that to have like, you know, maybe, oh, you know what, like career advancement options like master degrees, HD, so on and so forth, you know, you know, providing, let's say, career."
34420,PS5,6,1273.36,1281.52,8.16,3.0,"And maybe like opportunities for like volunteering or working, because then it's like, oh, they've got a sense that they're improving by staying in the job."
34420,PS5,6,1283.36,1284.16,0.8,1.0,You should become CEO.
34420,PS5,6,1284.28,1298.88,14.6,1.0,"OK, so offering community, let's say to, I don't know, like increase their sense of social responsibility?"
34420,PS5,6,1307.4,1312.84,5.44,1.0,"OK, OK, happy move on."
35217,PS2,6,0.04,0.96,0.92,1.0,Because I look at the time.
35217,PS2,6,1.6,10.16,8.56,2.0,"OK, 1."
35217,PS2,6,10.6,12.96,2.36,3.0,With the supply chain could lead to uncontrolled.
35217,PS2,6,12.96,13.4,0.44,1.0,Costs.
35217,PS2,6,14.6,16.6,2.0,3.0,And inefficient delivery.
35217,PS2,6,16.6,17.4,0.8,1.0,Schedules.
35217,PS2,6,25.0,26.96,1.96,3.0,"OK, what do we understand for the question?"
35217,PS2,6,29.36,30.84,1.48,4.0,Like what kind of vulnerabilities?
35217,PS2,6,30.88,31.12,0.24,4.0,Yeah.
35217,PS2,6,32.04,37.04,5.0,3.0,"Yeah, the written supply chain security and then the written inefficient delivery schedule."
35217,PS2,6,39.84,51.08,11.24,5.0,"I think it's like if you're trying to sell like corn and like there's like a blight that's, yeah, that's a vulnerability and it'll lead to uncontrol costs because you won't have any."
35217,PS2,6,51.4,52.32,0.92,5.0,And then price would go up.
35217,PS2,6,53.12,55.4,2.28,5.0,"Like if anything, the system breaks down, yeah."
35217,PS2,6,62.2,63.96,1.76,3.0,So I think we have two aspects to look at.
35217,PS2,6,63.96,65.4,1.44,3.0,One is the why could.
35217,PS2,6,65.4,66.84,1.44,1.0,Cost just go out and.
35217,PS2,6,67.32,71.12,3.8,3.0,Become uncontrolled and one is the delivery aspect.
35217,PS2,6,74.16,79.48,5.32,5.0,When it says delivery schedules it doesn't mean actual like.
35217,PS2,6,80.48,81.6,1.12,2.0,Delivery it could be.
35217,PS2,6,81.68,82.24,0.56,4.0,I think.
35217,PS2,6,83.4,83.76,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35217,PS2,6,84.68,85.12,0.44,5.0,"OK, good."
35217,PS2,6,90.88,104.84,13.96,5.0,"Well, there's like shopping local I guess and like for supermarkets to be buying things to be like selling I guess, like potatoes."
35217,PS2,6,106.12,106.56,0.44,5.0,But then.
35217,PS2,6,109.56,121.0,11.44,3.0,"I think the uncontrolled cost could like we'll try to figure out factors why that could lead to both of them and then maybe try solving at least one of them because like for example, uncontrolled costs could be due."
35217,PS2,6,121.0,121.36,0.36,1.0,To let's.
35217,PS2,6,121.36,121.72,0.36,3.0,Say weather.
35217,PS2,6,121.72,122.44,0.72,1.0,Conditions.
35217,PS2,6,122.72,125.28,2.56,3.0,And that could also affect like your delivery schedule.
35217,PS2,6,125.84,128.92,3.08,3.0,So if you're trying for example like you said in the.
35217,PS2,6,128.92,129.92,1.0,1.0,Case of corn.
35217,PS2,6,130.96,134.08,3.12,3.0,There's blight or like if what else?
35217,PS2,6,134.68,135.48,0.8,2.0,You just simply.
35217,PS2,6,135.8,140.24,4.44,1.0,Have to get something across and it's raining a lot and something that goes off.
35217,PS2,6,145.6,148.0,2.4,3.0,"Yeah, that's like keeping the change short."
35217,PS2,6,148.0,149.88,1.88,3.0,You're reducing the.
35217,PS2,6,152.2,153.96,1.76,3.0,"Yeah, the the less, the the shorter."
35217,PS2,6,156.04,168.8,12.76,6.0,"Yeah, but that's not really a solution to like just to shorten because this was done like these days, for instance, after the pandemic and everything."
35217,PS2,6,169.76,187.68,17.92,6.0,"Like companies try to have shorter supply chain because they like, do not rely on imports from other countries because they just saw the disruption and they realise that sometimes you just cannot produce your stuff if you don't have the resources close by."
35217,PS2,6,187.96,199.08,11.12,6.0,"Same with like energy, like many, many companies want to produce energy on their own now just to have like security and not import it from somewhere else."
35217,PS2,6,201.72,214.56,12.84,4.0,"Or maybe as a government you can like mandate that you must have at least a certain number of suppliers, like per product."
35217,PS2,6,214.56,214.88,0.32,2.0,Or something.
35217,PS2,6,216.52,221.48,4.96,3.0,See in the case where there's a there's a product that's not available in the country like.
35217,PS2,6,221.48,225.52,4.04,1.0,"You mentioned it could be like energy or something, like to meet us, for example, you have to get it from outside."
35217,PS2,6,225.52,226.44,0.92,1.0,There's no option there.
35217,PS2,6,227.0,231.44,4.44,3.0,But in case there is an option to get it from within the country then.
35217,PS2,6,231.88,232.48,0.6,1.0,Then maybe.
35217,PS2,6,232.48,234.36,1.88,3.0,Your solution comes into play.
35217,PS2,6,236.72,236.92,0.2,2.0,What?
35217,PS2,6,237.72,237.96,0.24,3.0,Kind of.
35217,PS2,6,237.96,238.48,0.52,1.0,Creatives.
35217,PS2,6,240.32,241.2,0.88,3.0,Creative ideas.
35217,PS2,6,242.2,262.64,20.44,5.0,"If they wanted like creative, you could look at it through the like consumer lens and like talk, maybe talk about making it more like normal for like kind of like reducing the expectation that like that it's going to be mass availability in every supermarket kind of thing."
35217,PS2,6,262.68,273.84,11.16,5.0,"Maybe like always kind of like have prices for things based on seasonally, which obviously they do."
35217,PS2,6,274.08,286.68,12.6,5.0,"But like if something if like people are wanting like, I don't know, like cherries in like December, then I guess raise the price of no way."
35217,PS2,6,286.72,287.48,0.76,5.0,This doesn't make sense.
35217,PS2,6,287.48,288.92,1.44,5.0,"Doesn't make sense, but you know what I mean?"
35217,PS2,6,288.92,299.28,10.36,5.0,"Like, like, maybe you could talk about like more of a cultural shift into having what's available, you know?"
35217,PS2,6,300.72,301.96,1.24,3.0,But isn't that what we?
35217,PS2,6,302.12,302.92,0.8,1.0,Went from.
35217,PS2,6,303.08,304.52,1.44,5.0,To Yeah.
35217,PS2,6,304.56,305.84,1.28,3.0,"Like, let's say watermelons."
35217,PS2,6,305.84,309.24,3.4,1.0,Were seasoned and now probably you can find them at any point.
35217,PS2,6,312.32,319.92,7.6,5.0,"But then sometimes we plans are extensive and I feel like that's, well, the vulnerability in that case is the fact that they're like forced."
35217,PS2,6,320.36,320.92,0.56,1.0,Forced growth.
35217,PS2,6,322.48,322.96,0.48,5.0,I don't know.
35217,PS2,6,326.8,337.68,10.88,3.0,"Schedule You have to make a supply chain secure, has to be reliable."
35217,PS2,6,349.8,355.2,5.4,3.0,"Yes, you can only have many backup plans to make sure that's thank you."
35217,PS2,6,355.32,355.68,0.36,5.0,Yeah.
35217,PS2,6,358.24,362.16,3.92,3.0,"To make it reliable, it has to be accountable at every step, maybe like."
35217,PS2,6,362.64,366.52,3.88,1.0,You should know whatever you're sending is what's getting received at the end.
35217,PS2,6,369.16,371.48,2.32,3.0,I mean with packages like Amazon probably.
35217,PS2,6,371.6,373.04,1.44,1.0,"It happens, but with things like."
35217,PS2,6,373.16,374.44,1.28,3.0,Fruits and vegetables.
35217,PS2,6,374.44,375.52,1.08,1.0,Maybe not so much.
35217,PS2,6,391.76,412.0,20.24,5.0,"Well, yeah, maybe like were you saying like not making sure that for like some things people have backup suppliers and that'll probably just Intel like anti monopoly legislation, which could just be a good, I mean, sorry, creative but and probably done already."
35217,PS2,6,412.32,420.76,8.44,5.0,"But like if there's, if there's a sole producer of like a certain thing, obviously any issue in that that supply chain is going to so I guess like that."
35217,PS2,6,423.44,425.32,1.88,4.0,I don't know if it's created or not.
35217,PS2,6,425.76,426.84,1.08,4.0,"I I mean, I agree with you."
35217,PS2,6,427.52,427.8,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35217,PS2,6,429.8,431.28,1.48,3.0,Problem is the creative idea.
35217,PS2,6,444.21,444.53,0.32,6.0,It would be.
35217,PS2,6,445.17,477.6,32.43,6.0,"It would be quite tough though, like if you have one supply of this particular product, let's say like a component, like, why do you like require a company to shift from one to like, OK, it's more secure for them, but they there could be some trade off in quality or something, especially when it comes to like technologies like, you know, like usually like mobile mobile phone companies, they just like to to tech companies."
35217,PS2,6,477.6,490.6,13.0,6.0,"They just have a supply of the chips and they don't want several suppliers of the of the of chips because then you like exposed to the technology risk, maybe not to supplying train risk, but."
35217,PS2,6,499.3,501.9,2.6,3.0,"I think I might have a creative idea, but I might not actually."
35217,PS2,6,502.62,502.74,0.12,6.0,Go.
35217,PS2,6,502.78,503.18,0.4,3.0,So you have.
35217,PS2,6,503.38,503.98,0.6,6.0,"Like, let's go you."
35217,PS2,6,504.3,507.16,2.86,3.0,Can have a network like.
35217,PS2,6,507.68,508.08,0.4,5.0,"Yeah, if you have."
35217,PS2,6,509.4,511.08,1.68,3.0,Like a tube network underground.
35217,PS2,6,511.12,517.12,6.0,3.0,So if like one break sign could still go like the other way and like it's safe from weather conditions and anything.
35217,PS2,6,517.28,521.68,4.4,3.0,And if that doesn't work always like go from another station and then there are many.
35217,PS2,6,521.68,522.08,0.4,5.0,Ways to?
35217,PS2,6,522.08,522.4,0.32,3.0,Get to.
35217,PS2,6,522.4,522.72,0.32,5.0,Some point.
35217,PS2,6,524.6,524.84,0.24,1.0,I think.
35217,PS2,6,524.84,527.28,2.44,3.0,What we can do is like at each.
35217,PS2,6,527.28,528.48,1.2,1.0,Stage you can have.
35217,PS2,6,528.76,529.4,0.64,3.0,A warehouse.
35217,PS2,6,529.4,530.12,0.72,1.0,Responsible.
35217,PS2,6,530.12,531.56,1.44,1.0,Let's say you're getting potatoes.
35217,PS2,6,531.56,536.28,4.72,1.0,Let it come from outside or like within the country for one area comes to like a main distribution.
35217,PS2,6,536.28,538.72,2.44,3.0,Centre and then from there going to.
35217,PS2,6,538.72,546.16,7.44,1.0,"Let's say all areas within let's say 100 kilometres, it should take one day like maybe make it more accountable like that."
35217,PS2,6,546.16,553.72,7.56,1.0,"You can have like zones like for example our London aspect, maybe just make loan zones that way and then that way you know, at each stage or like."
35217,PS2,6,553.84,554.84,1.0,3.0,Throughout the process what?
35217,PS2,6,554.84,565.0,10.16,1.0,Should happen each day and and it just makes it more predictable as to where let's say your potatoes are or like any component is after let's say X days.
35217,PS2,6,566.24,575.68,9.44,5.0,"So kind of like a mix of both as in like, yeah, you have like you have like distribution stops and like, but like there are lots of them and they're from different areas, OK."
35217,PS2,6,576.96,579.72,2.76,3.0,Kind of like a hierarchical hierarchical structure.
35217,PS2,6,580.4,584.04,3.64,1.0,So like maybe for the district or county?
35217,PS2,6,600.12,601.28,1.16,5.0,Like collect from.
35217,PS2,6,603.08,604.24,1.16,2.0,So all the supplies will.
35217,PS2,6,604.28,604.48,0.2,4.0,Bring.
35217,PS2,6,604.48,605.2,0.72,2.0,It to that warehouse.
35217,PS2,6,605.8,606.6,0.8,3.0,I don't have farmers.
35217,PS2,6,606.6,609.2,2.6,1.0,Because it could be any new company.
35217,PS2,6,617.12,618.68,1.56,3.0,Like this is something they're already doing.
35217,PS2,6,619.6,620.2,0.6,2.0,"It's OK, it's."
35217,PS2,6,621.48,623.4,1.92,3.0,"Yeah, I was thinking like a crazy maybe like."
35217,PS2,6,627.04,628.04,1.0,5.0,Actual tube system?
35217,PS2,6,628.56,631.04,2.48,5.0,"No, yeah, no, that would be creative."
35217,PS2,6,633.04,644.84,11.8,5.0,I'm going to say these distribution centres would be connected underground via high speed rail.
35217,PS2,6,649.6,650.12,0.52,5.0,Which word?
35217,PS2,6,650.32,650.92,0.6,5.0,Oh my gosh.
35217,PS2,6,652.0,652.32,0.32,5.0,Rail.
35217,PS2,6,657.88,658.88,1.0,3.0,"Yeah, just order Z."
35217,PS2,6,658.88,661.92,3.04,1.0,Potatoes and.
35217,PS2,6,669.96,671.24,1.28,3.0,If you want it immediately.
35217,PS2,6,671.24,672.32,1.08,1.0,You have to pay extra you.
35217,PS2,6,672.8,677.64,4.84,3.0,Want it within an hour if you want.
35217,PS2,6,677.84,678.72,0.88,1.0,"The next day, it's free."
35217,PS2,6,684.16,685.68,1.52,6.0,The chat will didn't come up with this.
35217,PS2,6,687.6,688.6,1.0,6.0,The chat will come up with.
35217,PS2,6,705.02,705.66,0.64,3.0,This right?
35217,PS2,6,705.66,711.94,6.28,1.0,"At home we can get any items, anything you want."
35217,PS2,6,714.5,716.06,1.56,5.0,"Right, everyone happy with that?"
35249,PS6,3,1.6,13.36,11.76,1.0,Nigeria research discovers the shower for 20 minutes for always good for health compare with encourage people to do this OK.
35249,PS6,3,13.88,16.36,2.48,2.0,To do shower for 20 minutes.
35249,PS6,3,16.76,18.32,1.56,1.0,Shower for 20 minutes.
35249,PS6,3,18.32,25.12,6.8,1.0,Stay in the shower for 20.
35249,PS6,3,25.12,25.36,0.24,2.0,Minutes.
35249,PS6,3,25.36,29.48,4.12,2.0,That means we need to let's mean interesting.
35249,PS6,3,30.04,31.8,1.76,1.0,Encourage people to do that.
35249,PS6,3,32.48,39.36,6.88,3.0,Maybe we can make a playlist or a video that is at least 20 minutes.
35249,PS6,3,39.92,45.8,5.88,3.0,"So, you know, people can just play when they go in the shower and not come back until it's over."
35249,PS6,3,46.84,47.72,0.88,3.0,It's 20 minutes.
35249,PS6,3,49.2,49.68,0.48,3.0,It's like.

35501,PS5,3,242.92,243.04,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35501,PS5,3,243.52,244.48,0.96,1.0,But it's not even taken.
35501,PS5,3,244.72,245.72,1.0,2.0,"Exactly this, but the."
35501,PS5,3,245.72,248.56,2.84,1.0,"Sabbaticals are critical right when they close the office, you know."
35501,PS5,3,248.92,253.44,4.52,2.0,"I mean, to to your point, annual leave is a bit of a double edged sword because it doesn't actually work."
35501,PS5,3,253.44,254.36,0.92,2.0,"People, yeah, don't take any."
35501,PS5,3,254.44,255.04,0.6,2.0,"I mean, right?"
35501,PS5,3,255.28,257.92,2.64,3.0,"Yeah, especially if it's the unlimited one, Yeah."
35501,PS5,3,258.16,262.84,4.68,2.0,"Because then you're looking for right now anyway, in terms of how to make sure people don't leave."
35501,PS5,3,263.52,266.8,3.28,1.0,Or which of these problems do we want to focus on if we choose one problem?
35501,PS5,3,267.64,270.0,2.36,2.0,"Well, you can, you can take each of these three boxes, right?"
35501,PS5,3,270.0,276.16,6.16,2.0,"So in terms of you look at the reward, assess competitiveness of paying reward packages, right?"
35501,PS5,3,276.16,281.8,5.64,2.0,"Make sure if you're competitive versus the market on pay and other benefits, right?"
35501,PS5,3,282.24,284.16,1.92,2.0,You look at the 3.3 that we wrote down.
35501,PS5,3,284.56,290.68,6.12,2.0,"So on the reward side, if you if you want to some people leaving because they're not feeling rewarded, you need to be evaluated when you've met the people enough."
35501,PS5,3,290.88,291.2,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35501,PS5,3,291.36,293.24,1.88,1.0,"But this is like a 5 point plan, yeah."
35501,PS5,3,293.24,295.68,2.44,1.0,What about like the creative idea?
35501,PS5,3,295.72,296.76,1.04,1.0,The one creative idea?
35501,PS5,3,297.2,302.24,5.04,2.0,Final that's actually not tell you about how I think it's not very great like creative it's fine we.
35501,PS5,3,302.24,305.6,3.36,3.0,"Can go, we can go through it and then like, yeah, this jumps."
35501,PS5,3,306.2,308.2,2.0,2.0,"Puppies in workplace, Puppies in workplace, that's always good."
35501,PS5,3,308.8,309.64,0.84,2.0,That's always good fun.
35501,PS5,3,310.08,311.64,1.56,2.0,That would make me very happy.
35501,PS5,3,311.64,312.68,1.04,2.0,So everyone else.
35501,PS5,3,313.12,315.2,2.08,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35501,PS5,3,315.2,315.64,0.44,3.0,What's 1?
35501,PS5,3,316.04,318.36,2.32,1.0,"Yeah, if we just like focus on one problem, right?"
35501,PS5,3,318.36,322.28,3.92,1.0,"And then we can expand them and then we can think of, OK, what are 5 ideas against that problem?"
35501,PS5,3,322.36,333.56,11.2,3.0,"Yeah, I feel like maybe like something around benefits because salary like, you know, everyone like increases, you know, it's kind of like a race to the top."
35501,PS5,3,334.04,336.08,2.04,3.0,So what's one thing?
35501,PS5,3,336.76,343.72,6.96,3.0,"I think something on the benefits is still a big topic, Real prospects, diverse experience, management strategy."
35501,PS5,3,344.12,345.44,1.32,3.0,"How do we do anything about that, right?"
35501,PS5,3,345.72,359.4,13.68,1.0,"I think it's really cool on any of these kinds of rotational programs where you can go and do a sabbatical in another company that's like tangential in the industry or if you have mentors coming in from other companies, there's like any way of like cross pollinating on ideas."
35501,PS5,3,359.4,359.8,0.4,3.0,That's true.
35501,PS5,3,359.88,361.2,1.32,3.0,I like that as this.
35501,PS5,3,361.72,362.36,0.64,3.0,Should we do that?
35501,PS5,3,362.36,363.12,0.76,3.0,Should we focus on that?
35501,PS5,3,363.44,365.28,1.84,3.0,We should show on that cyber sabbatical.
35501,PS5,3,367.28,368.2,0.92,1.0,Rotational program.
35501,PS5,3,368.32,368.88,0.56,3.0,Yeah.
35501,PS5,3,370.12,370.92,0.8,2.0,So rotate.
35501,PS5,3,371.28,372.36,1.08,2.0,That's an echocut collection.
35501,PS5,3,372.68,372.88,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
35501,PS5,3,374.16,375.84,1.68,1.0,Because it hits on the professional development.
35501,PS5,3,376.12,376.56,0.44,3.0,"Yeah, and."
35501,PS5,3,377.2,379.56,2.36,1.0,It gives you perspectives you can.
35501,PS5,3,379.56,385.84,6.28,3.0,"Choose to do one that's, you know, in a different company or one where it's like a different role where you're learning a different scale."
35501,PS5,3,385.84,390.48,4.64,3.0,"Like if you're a marketer and you suddenly want to be like in marketing, sorry, in a product or something."
35501,PS5,3,391.76,395.24,3.48,1.0,"And Rosh, you could do these gigs that were posted."
35501,PS5,3,395.24,397.56,2.32,1.0,It was like a a gig board posted internally.
35501,PS5,3,397.56,408.52,10.96,1.0,"So if some team and some other department needed help with something for three months, six months or whatever, and you had capacity, you could apply to do their gig, which is, yeah, for internal rotation."
35501,PS5,3,408.52,409.56,1.04,1.0,That's interesting.
35501,PS5,3,410.24,412.96,2.72,2.0,We started buying PlayStation 5 for all of our offices.
35501,PS5,3,412.96,413.44,0.48,2.0,Does that count?
35501,PS5,3,414.08,414.36,0.28,2.0,Terrific.
35501,PS5,3,414.36,415.92,1.56,2.0,We actually did like I told off it.
35501,PS5,3,416.08,419.52,3.44,3.0,Was like a They are like.

35501,PS5,3,430.24,431.12,0.88,1.0,Extra thing.
35501,PS5,3,431.4,431.56,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35501,PS5,3,432.2,433.08,0.88,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35501,PS5,3,434.36,438.72,4.36,1.0,"OK, so rotation program into."
35501,PS5,3,440.36,445.36,5.0,3.0,"Well, like, yeah, like learning, like start funding studies for those studies."
35501,PS5,3,447.12,448.44,1.32,3.0,And it doesn't have to be related.
35501,PS5,3,450.88,454.92,4.04,2.0,What about paying for you to go to the third world for a year and do good?
35501,PS5,3,456.84,464.0,7.16,3.0,"Google has something similar, you go not not not India but you can do these like 3 or 4 months."

35501,PS5,3,472.24,474.68,2.44,1.0,I think it's hard if it's disconnected right from your.
35501,PS5,3,475.32,475.4,0.08,2.0,You.
35501,PS5,3,475.64,477.2,1.56,1.0,Want some link then because then.

35501,PS5,3,479.12,491.92,12.8,2.0,"Also, the previous topic, it can't be what you don't see having like top talent from Google, for example, going to really poor communities and and and help lift them out of out of that situation, right?"
35501,PS5,3,492.36,497.48,5.12,3.0,"Well, yeah, like, yeah, like kind of getting paid to be a volunteer or working at a charity or something."

35501,PS5,3,504.16,513.12,8.96,1.0,"But when you get to actually apply your skills that you would normally apply in your workplace, so it's it's not, you know, suddenly building houses when you normally work for data."
35501,PS5,3,513.12,513.56,0.44,3.0,Scientists.
35501,PS5,3,513.68,514.56,0.88,3.0,That's the worst kind.

35501,PS5,3,571.24,578.2,6.96,2.0,"Somehow I think it's, I mean, I'm very analytical in in trying to understand the issue and it's also quite creative."
35501,PS5,3,578.2,580.36,2.16,2.0,I would say maybe we can be on some of the creative side of this one.
35501,PS5,3,580.36,581.8,1.44,2.0,It's not too bad.
35501,PS5,3,593.24,602.48,9.24,3.0,"Yeah, though one of my, I saw LinkedIn, one of my friends companies, they did really well."

35501,PS5,3,624.8,627.72,2.92,2.0,"They were all given like like a piece of gold, literally."
35501,PS5,3,627.72,627.8,0.08,2.0,Wow.

35501,PS5,3,641.92,643.4,1.48,3.0,"I don't know, not that much."
35501,PS5,3,643.92,645.72,1.8,2.0,"OK, let's get this one OK."
35501,PS5,3,649.12,653.68,4.56,1.0,"Of course, they're evaluating as well how our answers are going to decline."
35501,PS5,3,653.68,653.92,0.24,1.0,What do?
35501,PS5,3,654.2,656.24,2.04,2.0,"You say we're getting better, by the way."
35501,PS5,3,657.4,664.72,7.32,1.0,"Yeah, I think that I'm sure that we have a a very short threshold of for how long we can be creative."
35501,PS5,3,665.28,668.36,3.08,2.0,"You know, that's actually not very long, as it turns out."
35501,PS5,3,670.08,670.48,0.4,2.0,That's true.
35501,PS5,3,670.64,672.48,1.84,2.0,I should also at a certain time of day.

35651,PS3,6,122.92,123.76,0.84,6.0,I think so.
35651,PS3,6,124.68,125.6,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, just one."
35651,PS3,6,126.28,126.48,0.2,4.0,You have.
35651,PS3,6,126.56,126.64,0.08,5.0,An.
35651,PS3,6,126.88,127.6,0.72,3.0,Idea about one minute.
35651,PS3,6,128.08,128.2,0.12,1.0,OK.
35651,PS3,6,128.2,128.36,0.16,1.0,OK.
35651,PS3,6,128.44,135.12,6.68,1.0,"Yeah, I think it's more about that discussion group."
35651,PS3,6,135.16,135.72,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, it's kind of a."
35651,PS3,6,135.72,135.84,0.12,3.0,Good.
35651,PS3,6,138.36,138.68,0.32,1.0,Decision.
35651,PS3,6,143.52,148.56,5.04,3.0,"I think sorry is a word that make people feel sorry, right?"
35651,PS3,6,148.6,152.64,4.04,3.0,So I think you can to let.
35651,PS3,6,152.64,154.72,2.08,6.0,The country to ban this word and use.
35651,PS3,6,154.76,155.88,1.12,3.0,Other words instead.
35651,PS3,6,156.04,157.6,1.56,6.0,Such as thank you or.
35651,PS3,6,157.92,159.28,1.36,3.0,Accuse me or something like that.
35651,PS3,6,159.84,161.2,1.36,3.0,So is that a possible?
35651,PS3,6,161.2,161.68,0.48,5.0,Solution.
35651,PS3,6,161.68,161.8,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35651,PS3,6,164.2,166.96,2.76,1.0,Possible solution?
35651,PS3,6,166.96,170.08,3.12,1.0,Do you think the solution would be the most creative solution?
35651,PS3,6,170.32,172.92,2.6,5.0,"Creative, that is."
35651,PS3,6,172.92,174.24,1.32,3.0,The first thing that comes to.
35651,PS3,6,174.4,175.28,0.88,6.0,Comes to my mind.
35651,PS3,6,175.28,176.24,0.96,6.0,"So that's the normal thing, people."
35651,PS3,6,176.76,186.84,10.08,2.0,So I think they may use also masks that change the world because I'm not sure it spreads when they say sorry or when the other party hear the sorry.
35651,PS3,6,188.44,191.72,3.28,1.0,"So when they say so, can they say sorry?"
35651,PS3,6,191.96,193.24,1.28,5.0,Can we invent?
35651,PS3,6,193.8,194.44,0.64,3.0,A device.
35651,PS3,6,194.8,195.84,1.04,6.0,A device that.
35651,PS3,6,196.08,196.92,0.84,3.0,Attached to.
35651,PS3,6,197.76,200.08,2.32,6.0,"To to, to your body like a watch and."
35651,PS3,6,200.32,201.68,1.36,3.0,Everybody will have this.
35651,PS3,6,201.72,202.36,0.64,6.0,And you cannot.
35651,PS3,6,202.36,202.96,0.6,3.0,Take it this.
35651,PS3,6,203.64,204.8,1.16,6.0,And the.
35651,PS3,6,205.28,205.96,0.68,3.0,If this.
35651,PS3,6,206.28,206.76,0.48,6.0,Detect.
35651,PS3,6,206.76,208.24,1.48,3.0,That the word.
35651,PS3,6,208.24,209.32,1.08,5.0,Sorry.
35651,PS3,6,209.72,210.52,0.8,3.0,The the 1st.
35651,PS3,6,211.08,212.52,1.44,6.0,"Sound, and it will."
35651,PS3,6,212.6,213.12,0.52,3.0,Beat you.
35651,PS3,6,213.48,214.84,1.36,6.0,"And to, to."
35651,PS3,6,215.24,215.8,0.56,6.0,"Yeah, to."
35651,PS3,6,215.88,216.52,0.64,3.0,Intervent.
35651,PS3,6,216.8,219.92,3.12,3.0,"So this is physical intervention, something like."
35651,PS3,6,219.92,220.32,0.4,6.0,That so.
35651,PS3,6,220.4,221.0,0.6,3.0,Is that OK?
35651,PS3,6,222.36,223.04,0.68,4.0,"Yeah, I think."
35651,PS3,6,223.08,223.76,0.68,4.0,Any idea you know?
35651,PS3,6,224.44,225.28,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,226.36,230.52,4.16,4.0,"Yeah, it says it's evaluated based on creativity and usefulness."
35651,PS3,6,230.64,231.68,1.04,3.0,So as long as it's.
35651,PS3,6,232.0,232.36,0.36,4.0,Creative.
35651,PS3,6,233.6,236.04,2.44,4.0,"I don't know what that means, you know, being I."
35651,PS3,6,236.28,255.8,19.52,1.0,Like the idea of it's marked mask that when you say sorry it's red and then you can say sorry but with a mask and then you say sorry but the mask can get red and then you know the other person will not hear that but.
35651,PS3,6,257.16,258.12,0.96,5.0,I think it's.
35651,PS3,6,258.12,264.56,6.44,3.0,"It's quite strange that that the epidemic, sorry."
35651,PS3,6,264.56,268.2,3.64,3.0,So it is transmitted by hearing or Yeah.
35651,PS3,6,272.0,275.36,3.36,5.0,So and and so you you mean the mask?
35651,PS3,6,275.44,275.84,0.4,3.0,It it.
35651,PS3,6,276.92,277.64,0.72,5.0,Cut off the.
35651,PS3,6,277.64,279.12,1.48,3.0,Submission the.
35651,PS3,6,279.16,279.96,0.8,6.0,Submission and.
35651,PS3,6,280.52,281.96,1.44,3.0,You can use.
35651,PS3,6,281.96,283.8,1.84,6.0,"Some earphones, something like that."
35651,PS3,6,284.16,285.24,1.08,3.0,So that that is.
35651,PS3,6,285.56,286.92,1.36,5.0,To cut off your.
35651,PS3,6,288.12,289.24,1.12,3.0,Receiving so.
35651,PS3,6,290.2,290.44,0.24,5.0,Yeah.
35651,PS3,6,293.88,293.92,0.04,1.0,I.
35651,PS3,6,295.12,295.96,0.84,5.0,Think I mean.
35651,PS3,6,296.48,297.88,1.4,3.0,You can say sorry but.
35651,PS3,6,298.44,299.84,1.4,6.0,You can have your earphone everybody.
35651,PS3,6,299.84,300.32,0.48,3.0,Has it?
35651,PS3,6,301.08,301.4,0.32,6.0,And.
35651,PS3,6,302.12,303.64,1.52,3.0,If the system detect.
35651,PS3,6,303.64,306.16,2.52,6.0,That somebody saying sorry.
35651,PS3,6,306.32,311.08,4.76,3.0,"Or yeah, so it will close your ears, close your."
35651,PS3,6,311.2,311.56,0.36,6.0,Ears.
35651,PS3,6,311.56,312.2,0.64,6.0,Something like that.
35651,PS3,6,314.44,316.32,1.88,3.0,"Yeah, so I think that's a solution."
35651,PS3,6,317.04,317.36,0.32,6.0,"Yeah, is it?"
35651,PS3,6,319.88,323.72,3.84,2.0,About saying the word or being here about the.
35651,PS3,6,324.12,324.96,0.84,5.0,"Other part Oh, I think it's."
35651,PS3,6,325.64,326.6,0.96,3.0,It prevents.
35651,PS3,6,326.6,328.24,1.64,6.0,People from hearing the.
35651,PS3,6,328.24,328.52,0.28,3.0,Word.
35651,PS3,6,328.52,329.88,1.36,3.0,"Sorry, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,330.4,330.84,0.44,1.0,So.
35651,PS3,6,331.32,335.04,3.72,3.0,We can have the the two together because they are.
35651,PS3,6,335.32,336.08,0.76,6.0,Disjoint.
35651,PS3,6,337.16,337.88,0.72,5.0,They're they're.
35651,PS3,6,337.88,338.52,0.64,3.0,Orthogonal.
35651,PS3,6,338.56,339.48,0.92,6.0,They're irrelevant.
35651,PS3,6,339.52,339.8,0.28,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,341.16,352.13,10.97,1.0,"Yeah, it just."
35651,PS3,6,352.13,361.29,9.16,2.0,"For the most, I believe if the most actually use the first step like the most itself replaces the word, then with time there will be the new culture."
35651,PS3,6,361.61,361.77,0.16,3.0,Like.
35651,PS3,6,362.25,365.77,3.52,2.0,"People will get used to using my butt, for example."
35651,PS3,6,365.77,366.57,0.8,1.0,Instead of sorry.
35651,PS3,6,367.33,368.57,1.24,2.0,Just like more sustainable.
35651,PS3,6,369.17,369.69,0.52,1.0,Solution.
35651,PS3,6,370.44,376.0,5.56,2.0,"Because it was suppressed only the word sorry, then the behaviour of the people still will not change."
35651,PS3,6,376.96,377.04,0.08,1.0,It.
35651,PS3,6,377.04,379.48,2.44,2.0,"Says sorry, and the technology would suppress that."
35651,PS3,6,380.0,380.2,0.2,4.0,Yeah.
35651,PS3,6,380.28,381.96,1.68,4.0,"Otherwise we have to wear that mask, Yeah."
35651,PS3,6,382.32,387.32,5.0,1.0,"Actually, the mask is really complicated."
35651,PS3,6,387.32,387.44,0.12,5.0,Right.
35651,PS3,6,387.44,390.48,3.04,5.0,"Yeah, so, so I mean that the."
35651,PS3,6,390.48,391.44,0.96,3.0,Watch is OK.
35651,PS3,6,391.92,392.36,0.44,1.0,So sorry.
35651,PS3,6,395.64,396.76,1.12,3.0,What's the watch for?
35651,PS3,6,397.12,399.6,2.48,5.0,"So we mean so sorry, so."
35651,PS3,6,399.8,403.48,3.68,3.0,"It is very sensitive and very timely, so you say."
35651,PS3,6,403.48,405.2,1.72,5.0,Sore sore.
35651,PS3,6,406.76,407.08,0.32,5.0,So it.
35651,PS3,6,407.28,408.08,0.8,3.0,Will beat you to.
35651,PS3,6,408.08,409.88,1.8,6.0,Interrupt you so like that.
35651,PS3,6,410.48,411.4,0.92,5.0,"Yeah, it decays."
35651,PS3,6,411.76,412.68,0.92,5.0,"Yeah, if it is very."
35651,PS3,6,412.68,414.44,1.76,3.0,Sensitive so we can just give you.
35651,PS3,6,414.44,416.88,2.44,4.0,A you know we can develop a device kind.
35651,PS3,6,417.2,417.92,0.72,5.0,"Of, you know, yeah, between."
35651,PS3,6,417.96,418.68,0.72,4.0,"The mask, you know?"
35651,PS3,6,418.8,419.2,0.4,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, the."
35651,PS3,6,419.28,419.72,0.44,5.0,Mask used.
35651,PS3,6,419.72,420.64,0.92,4.0,To the behavior.
35651,PS3,6,420.68,421.48,0.8,3.0,And then get rid of.
35651,PS3,6,421.68,421.84,0.16,5.0,Mask.
35651,PS3,6,421.84,424.12,2.28,5.0,"Yeah, it's a kind of."
35651,PS3,6,424.12,425.28,1.16,6.0,Devices so.
35651,PS3,6,425.8,426.88,1.08,5.0,You have other devices.
35651,PS3,6,427.2,447.0,19.8,1.0,"If you have like an app on your phone, when you're about to say sorry, you know when about say sorry, it's going to text in some way and you know they need to sound and something like that, because some point is something easy that you're you always care with you most of the time and it will be a simple."
35651,PS3,6,447.0,447.8,0.8,3.0,Solution to.
35651,PS3,6,450.4,451.44,1.04,4.0,Electric shock.
35651,PS3,6,460.16,462.72,2.56,1.0,"But actually it's interesting, isn't it?"
35651,PS3,6,462.76,470.48,7.72,1.0,"It's it's like, do you know that that kind of colour that prevent dogs to bark to bark?"
35651,PS3,6,471.28,471.56,0.28,4.0,What that?
35651,PS3,6,472.36,475.0,2.64,1.0,"Kind of colour, that colour that you put in the dog."
35651,PS3,6,475.2,475.44,0.24,5.0,And then.
35651,PS3,6,475.44,476.08,0.64,5.0,"Oh yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,476.12,478.8,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, it's about to physically stop that."
35651,PS3,6,479.44,480.76,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, it is similar, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,480.84,481.84,1.0,1.0,It's a.
35651,PS3,6,482.4,482.64,0.24,5.0,Symbol.
35651,PS3,6,482.84,484.64,1.8,5.0,"Yeah, so and if by doing."
35651,PS3,6,484.64,488.16,3.52,3.0,This if you say sorry and it will give the negative.
35651,PS3,6,488.16,489.4,1.24,6.0,Signal and.
35651,PS3,6,490.64,491.0,0.36,5.0,Many.
35651,PS3,6,491.0,492.04,1.04,3.0,Times your brain will.
35651,PS3,6,492.08,494.2,2.12,6.0,Will learn that so.
35651,PS3,6,494.24,494.64,0.4,3.0,It will.
35651,PS3,6,494.64,496.0,1.36,6.0,Train your brain so you.
35651,PS3,6,496.32,496.92,0.6,3.0,Will not.
35651,PS3,6,496.96,498.08,1.12,6.0,See any story?
35651,PS3,6,498.76,500.6,1.84,3.0,But even if you don't have this so.
35651,PS3,6,501.48,501.76,0.28,1.0,Maybe.
35651,PS3,6,502.24,502.76,0.52,6.0,"Yeah, maybe."
35651,PS3,6,504.16,510.28,6.12,1.0,Another way I think is my major is communication and information media.
35651,PS3,6,510.28,517.92,7.64,1.0,And the the method I think it can it can work with it can use some device to block the transmission of the server.
35651,PS3,6,518.56,521.08,2.52,1.0,"Yeah, with what method?"
35651,PS3,6,522.24,522.72,0.48,1.0,"Oh, you can block."
35651,PS3,6,523.12,527.32,4.2,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, the I agree because I mentioned that you."
35651,PS3,6,527.32,528.28,0.96,3.0,Can wear an.
35651,PS3,6,528.4,529.88,1.48,6.0,"Earphone or something like that, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,529.92,530.72,0.8,3.0,Prevent the story.
35651,PS3,6,530.72,531.12,0.4,3.0,It's yeah.
35651,PS3,6,531.68,533.0,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, prevent this work."
35651,PS3,6,533.0,534.08,1.08,4.0,"Yeah, just."
35651,PS3,6,534.68,535.12,0.44,5.0,Mute the story.
35651,PS3,6,535.12,535.48,0.36,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,535.48,536.0,0.52,5.0,Where it's a.
35651,PS3,6,536.0,537.28,1.28,3.0,Filter right so.
35651,PS3,6,537.48,538.56,1.08,5.0,You can hear.
35651,PS3,6,539.56,540.32,0.76,3.0,It receives.
35651,PS3,6,540.32,544.28,3.96,6.0,A signal and the and filter it into the non story sentences.
35651,PS3,6,544.28,546.0,1.72,6.0,So so.
35651,PS3,6,546.56,547.24,0.68,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,548.52,556.16,7.64,1.0,"Or we can use the transformer and yeah, the kind of transfer the work story to get another one."
35651,PS3,6,557.0,557.64,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, sure."
35651,PS3,6,557.8,558.36,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,559.8,559.88,0.08,5.0,The.
35651,PS3,6,561.76,562.56,0.8,1.0,Regular community.
35651,PS3,6,562.56,564.56,2.0,4.0,"By the way, it says one creative idea."
35651,PS3,6,564.92,565.24,0.32,1.0,This one.
35651,PS3,6,565.24,565.56,0.32,1.0,This one.
35651,PS3,6,566.68,567.6,0.92,5.0,But just one we.
35651,PS3,6,567.6,568.64,1.04,3.0,Have to vote right We.
35651,PS3,6,569.52,570.48,0.96,1.0,Have to vote Yeah I.
35651,PS3,6,570.48,576.84,6.36,2.0,Think we agree with there is a device that would suppress that would replace the word sorry.
35651,PS3,6,577.12,577.88,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,578.0,579.48,1.48,4.0,I think that might be the simplest.
35651,PS3,6,579.48,582.16,2.68,4.0,"You know, whenever it detects sorry that you replace."
35651,PS3,6,582.16,587.52,5.36,1.0,This with something else which is bloody that are we transfer transfer it to another one.
35651,PS3,6,587.88,589.0,1.12,4.0,"Something is I love you, I."
35651,PS3,6,589.24,589.4,0.16,1.0,Think.
35651,PS3,6,591.2,592.12,0.92,4.0,Something nice.
35651,PS3,6,592.44,595.88,3.44,1.0,"Yeah, it's."
35651,PS3,6,596.6,605.04,8.44,4.0,"OK, just develop a device that can detect the word sorry and replace with a different mode."
35651,PS3,6,605.04,606.84,1.8,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35651,PS3,6,607.44,608.64,1.2,1.0,Can you write that so?
35651,PS3,6,609.12,610.68,1.56,3.0,You mean with a device to?
35651,PS3,6,610.96,612.08,1.12,4.0,"Just yeah, develop."
35651,PS3,6,618.2,618.92,0.72,4.0,Do we have time?
35651,PS3,6,622.76,625.08,2.32,1.0,And deploy your device.
35651,PS3,6,630.87,630.99,0.12,4.0,And.
35651,PS3,6,639.6,646.52,6.92,4.0,Immediately sent to another word.
35651,PS3,6,647.28,647.92,0.64,4.0,Easy.
36284,PS6,3,3.08,3.84,0.76,1.0,I love it.
36284,PS6,3,10.4,10.64,0.24,2.0,Love.
36284,PS6,3,12.04,22.28,10.24,1.0,"So I mean, if you what's the cost if you install everybody's in everybody's shower, a karaoke machine that would be like a machine in the shower."
36284,PS6,3,22.6,26.68,4.08,2.0,"Is what do we incorporate, incorporate in the, in the shower, in the?"
36284,PS6,3,26.8,31.08,4.28,1.0,"In the, in the, in the room, in the, in the, whatever, right That that I mean, that's I'm not."
36284,PS6,3,31.08,31.24,0.16,2.0,Sure.
36284,PS6,3,31.24,32.84,1.6,2.0,What is the name of this thing that you You?
36284,PS6,3,32.84,33.16,0.32,1.0,Know that?
36284,PS6,3,33.16,33.92,0.76,1.0,Like the shower head?
36284,PS6,3,34.0,34.2,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
36284,PS6,3,34.28,36.44,2.16,2.0,"Yeah, the shower head have like incorporated like."
36284,PS6,3,36.64,37.28,0.64,1.0,Karaoke.
36284,PS6,3,37.76,39.84,2.08,2.0,Karaoke and sound system.
36284,PS6,3,40.96,42.6,1.64,2.0,"Microphone system, Yeah."
36284,PS6,3,42.84,43.28,0.44,1.0,Water.
36284,PS6,3,43.28,44.24,0.96,1.0,I would love microphone.
36284,PS6,3,44.72,45.04,0.32,1.0,Oh yeah.
36284,PS6,3,45.24,46.08,0.84,1.0,"Oh, brilliant."
36284,PS6,3,46.08,47.04,0.96,1.0,"Yes, that's the better idea."
36284,PS6,3,47.04,50.72,3.68,1.0,"OK, let me just write this down for us in shower."
36284,PS6,3,51.44,55.24,3.8,1.0,What's it called in shower head and room?
36284,PS6,3,55.64,59.56,3.92,1.0,"So the second idea is to like make it that the water only comes if you sing, right?"
36284,PS6,3,60.48,61.32,0.84,1.0,Is that what you're saying?
36284,PS6,3,61.32,61.52,0.2,1.0,Because.
36284,PS6,3,61.52,62.64,1.12,3.0,I thought that was what you're saying.
36284,PS6,3,63.56,64.12,0.56,2.0,Fantastic.
36284,PS6,3,64.96,67.28,2.32,1.0,"But then they have to sing for oh God, I have to sing for 20 minutes."
36284,PS6,3,67.28,69.68,2.4,1.0,"OK, great."
36284,PS6,3,69.92,71.68,1.76,2.0,This what you said is the idea.
36284,PS6,3,71.68,73.96,2.28,2.0,"I mean, let write it down and we'll move forward, OK?"
36284,PS6,3,74.92,75.84,0.92,1.0,"Would you agree, Lee?"
36284,PS6,3,75.84,78.2,2.36,1.0,What do you think that only?
36284,PS6,3,78.8,80.8,2.0,2.0,Shower comes out only when you.
36284,PS6,3,80.8,83.88,3.08,1.0,Sing only produces or hot water.
36284,PS6,3,83.88,87.72,3.84,1.0,Hot water when when you sing.
36284,PS6,3,88.28,89.44,1.16,1.0,But then should should it come?
36284,PS6,3,89.44,93.76,4.32,1.0,"Like just when you start singing it comes, or that you sing for 20 minutes and then it comes."
36284,PS6,3,93.76,94.52,0.76,3.0,"No, 'cause I'm not sure."
36284,PS6,3,94.52,94.8,0.28,3.0,It's not.
36284,PS6,3,94.8,95.2,0.4,3.0,It's not gonna.
36284,PS6,3,95.6,96.44,0.84,2.0,Be a prerequisite.
36284,PS6,3,97.24,99.88,2.64,2.0,I don't have to stay in the shower singing for 20.
36284,PS6,3,99.88,101.16,1.28,1.0,Minutes and then you doing.
36284,PS6,3,101.24,101.8,0.56,2.0,Nothing.
36284,PS6,3,101.8,103.0,1.2,2.0,And then take your shower.
36284,PS6,3,103.16,107.52,4.36,1.0,When you and then and stops when you stop singing until you refine it.
36284,PS6,3,107.96,108.56,0.6,1.0,"OK, that's fine."
36284,PS6,3,108.68,109.32,0.64,1.0,Are we OK with that?
36284,PS6,3,109.8,111.16,1.36,2.0,"Yes, I'm super OK with that."
36284,PS6,3,111.16,111.8,0.64,2.0,I love this.
36284,PS6,3,112.28,113.16,0.88,1.0,I'll I'll develop a.
36284,PS6,3,113.16,115.76,2.6,2.0,Shower device that only produces hot water.
36284,PS6,3,115.76,118.76,3.0,2.0,"OK, when you start singing it starts."
36284,PS6,3,118.76,119.68,0.92,1.0,With it starts singing.
36284,PS6,3,119.76,121.2,1.44,2.0,Until you reach 20 minutes.
36284,PS6,3,121.2,124.44,3.24,2.0,Oh God I love this.
36284,PS6,3,124.44,124.72,0.28,2.0,"OK, good."
36284,PS6,3,125.28,126.76,1.48,1.0,We'll collaborate later on this.
36284,PS6,3,126.88,128.32,1.44,2.0,And I love Let's do it.
36284,PS6,3,128.32,128.88,0.56,2.0,"No, we're doing."
36283,PS1,6,2.6,3.96,1.36,1.0,This is much more boring.
36283,PS1,6,5.4,6.56,1.16,2.0,I need extra money for this.
36283,PS1,6,12.84,14.72,1.88,1.0,"OK, let's get the the bad ideas out of that."
36283,PS1,6,15.56,16.36,0.8,1.0,What's a bad idea?
36283,PS1,6,16.36,16.76,0.4,1.0,Let's see.
36283,PS1,6,18.48,19.56,1.08,1.0,So one idea is just.
36283,PS1,6,19.56,31.52,11.96,2.0,To reuse of plastic or oh oh create create genetically modified plants that can absorb microplastics from the soil or the water.
36283,PS1,6,32.96,34.4,1.44,2.0,Actually there is a start up like this.
36283,PS1,6,34.6,37.0,2.4,2.0,They're they're using not not plastics.
36283,PS1,6,37.0,44.28,7.28,2.0,They're using it for absorbing toxic metals from the soil.
36283,PS1,6,44.28,45.36,1.08,3.0,I've heard there's a water.
36283,PS1,6,46.24,55.12,8.88,2.0,"So genetically modified plants, they have the ability to absorb microplastic from soil and water and contain them."
36283,PS1,6,55.6,58.08,2.48,2.0,"So then when you cut the plant, you crop the plant but."
36283,PS1,6,59.24,61.48,2.24,3.0,What is it but that what we're talking about?
36283,PS1,6,61.48,62.0,0.52,3.0,Like would it?
36283,PS1,6,62.48,64.88,2.4,2.0,It reduces plastic pollution in the sense of.
36283,PS1,6,65.96,68.88,2.92,3.0,But it will still be around you by your cure like I.
36283,PS1,6,69.08,69.56,0.48,1.0,Think it isn't?
36283,PS1,6,69.56,70.8,1.24,1.0,It doesn't make you.
36283,PS1,6,70.84,71.92,1.08,1.0,It's just like it's just around.
36283,PS1,6,71.96,74.0,2.04,3.0,Like it's an existing idea and you're still living.
36283,PS1,6,75.4,81.08,5.68,4.0,With it so like it's not going to make you absolutely in our alternative to the plastic.
36283,PS1,6,81.52,82.04,0.52,1.0,Like couples?
36283,PS1,6,82.36,94.4,12.04,4.0,"And again, using this AI model because they can do a lot of things in terms of to, to create new materials, which might be, let's say, not absorb, but."
36283,PS1,6,95.04,95.88,0.84,2.0,Biodegradable.
36283,PS1,6,96.84,98.56,1.72,4.0,But isn't it destroyed under the sun?
36283,PS1,6,98.56,119.48,20.92,4.0,"For example, A and the bio material whatsoever in other material with the same usability characteristic, but which might be, let's say destroyed under the HUV whatever or in the soil or in this salty water immediately within the sea AD or whatever."
36283,PS1,6,120.12,128.04,7.92,2.0,So we could say replace traditional plastic with lab grown bio bio.
36283,PS1,6,128.52,129.36,0.84,1.0,Material.
36283,PS1,6,129.36,133.76,4.4,2.0,That possess similar mechanical properties to.
36283,PS1,6,133.84,134.4,0.56,3.0,Plastic.
36283,PS1,6,134.8,136.2,1.4,2.0,And that they are biodegradable.
36283,PS1,6,136.52,142.6,6.08,3.0,Coupled with a policy intervention of banning plastic policy tax tax.
36283,PS1,6,145.84,146.4,0.56,3.0,I don't.
36283,PS1,6,146.4,148.48,2.08,3.0,"But like yeah, it, it plays a major role."
36283,PS1,6,149.0,153.84,4.84,3.0,But I feel like in this case scenario it does work if you just stop manufacturing plastic bans.
36283,PS1,6,154.08,155.52,1.44,1.0,"Yeah, some countries have that."
36283,PS1,6,155.52,156.36,0.84,1.0,Some countries have that.
36283,PS1,6,156.4,171.08,14.68,3.0,"Most, most plastic things, if not all, but like I think the the bigger problem you can always think about and coupled with that idea, I think those two together would would kind of like reduce plastic pollution."
36283,PS1,6,171.48,173.96,2.48,2.0,"Yeah, The thing is that we need to come up with a creative idea."
36283,PS1,6,173.96,178.0,4.04,2.0,"So a non creative idea, we're going to say bad plastic, use of plastic."
36283,PS1,6,178.32,178.72,0.4,2.0,You know what?
36283,PS1,6,178.72,180.48,1.76,3.0,I'm saying just not bad use of plastic.
36283,PS1,6,180.48,182.36,1.88,3.0,Ban use of plastic doesn't work.
36283,PS1,6,182.36,184.92,2.56,3.0,"We are doing that, but stop manufacturing it."
36283,PS1,6,185.68,186.76,1.08,1.0,So ban the production of.
36283,PS1,6,186.76,195.32,8.56,3.0,"Yeah, ban the production of like, ban the production of at least the more problematic kind of plastics."
36283,PS1,6,195.52,195.88,0.36,1.0,Is not.
36283,PS1,6,196.24,201.92,5.68,5.0,"So we're idea, but if we want to be creative, can we just stop teaching people how to make plastic to the?"
36283,PS1,6,202.6,203.48,0.88,3.0,"Yeah, actually."
36283,PS1,6,203.96,204.72,0.76,1.0,Destroy all the.
36283,PS1,6,205.88,206.8,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, destroy."
36283,PS1,6,206.84,208.44,1.6,2.0,Any know how or?
36283,PS1,6,209.04,210.4,1.36,4.0,IP regarding the.
36283,PS1,6,210.44,211.28,0.84,3.0,Processes.
36283,PS1,6,211.48,212.96,1.48,5.0,I just don't pass this knowledge.
36283,PS1,6,213.6,216.36,2.76,3.0,To get everything on the Internet which tells you plastic so.
36283,PS1,6,216.8,218.0,1.2,5.0,No one must tell who make them.
36283,PS1,6,221.84,221.92,0.08,3.0,Wow.
36283,PS1,6,223.32,224.08,0.76,1.0,That's quite good.
36283,PS1,6,227.68,232.04,4.36,1.0,So but then I guess we still have to think about the existing plastic which there is quite a lot of.
36283,PS1,6,232.04,233.28,1.24,1.0,So is there anything about that?
36283,PS1,6,233.6,234.92,1.32,1.0,So if you combine this one with the other.
36283,PS1,6,234.92,237.6,2.68,3.0,"One, I think for that the chemicals would work."
36283,PS1,6,238.08,238.36,0.28,1.0,Which would.
36283,PS1,6,238.36,240.08,1.72,1.0,So then we had to combine I guess multiple things.
36283,PS1,6,240.16,247.2,7.04,4.0,"Right, OK, listen, a lot of programs with the game, but the problem is to collect and to divide and to, to spread the garbage."
36283,PS1,6,247.6,249.16,1.56,4.0,"And this is a big, big, big problem."
36283,PS1,6,250.08,257.0,6.92,4.0,"You, you may, you may put the some Soca vest in, in, in one in, in, in one bag."
36283,PS1,6,257.16,262.84,5.68,4.0,"And then this plastic bag with a few, let's say pipes inside."
36283,PS1,6,263.64,265.68,2.04,4.0,And that's the tricky thing.
36283,PS1,6,265.68,267.36,1.68,4.0,That's how to how to split.
36283,PS1,6,267.36,267.96,0.6,3.0,It Yeah.
36283,PS1,6,269.0,274.44,5.44,4.0,That's why all the programs right now all over the world doesn't work.
36283,PS1,6,275.64,282.2,6.56,4.0,"You know, you know how many millions of plastic pipe in America, 350 million a day."
36283,PS1,6,284.88,298.68,13.8,4.0,"And so and to, to, to do, to protect, to protect the, the reduction to, to, to reduce the plastic by some, I don't know legal regulation or operational regulation."
36283,PS1,6,298.68,300.88,2.2,4.0,It's impossible to to to be done right now.
36283,PS1,6,301.24,303.4,2.16,4.0,That's but just only one thing.
36283,PS1,6,303.4,305.44,2.04,4.0,Is a new material or new?
36283,PS1,6,305.44,306.16,0.72,4.0,Let's see.
36283,PS1,6,307.0,309.16,2.16,6.0,But I feel like why I'm saying that is also because like.
36283,PS1,6,310.08,314.08,4.0,3.0,That kind of like really small things are so adaptable.
36283,PS1,6,314.64,321.16,6.52,3.0,"I think humans can just adapt to new usage of like, why do we need straws to stick from like a cup or a glass?"
36283,PS1,6,321.16,326.32,5.16,3.0,Like I'm sure they can come up like like with that kind of adaptability once it's banned.
36283,PS1,6,327.2,329.12,1.92,1.0,Or the different material for the straws and all these.
36283,PS1,6,329.16,340.16,11.0,2.0,Things another idea would be to have some sort of plastic tracker in in a form of an application that kind of tracks plastic within your environment.
36283,PS1,6,340.68,343.12,2.44,2.0,"Like, oh, you're using this plastic cup, for example."

36283,PS1,6,377.84,394.68,16.84,3.0,"And this is actually giving me this idea, you know, that the game the the Pokémon Go thing that you just like, yeah, allow about making cards out of plastic materials instead of like that and then like letting people play and find plastic and then like also create basically the same thing, just gamified."

36283,PS1,6,432.84,447.08,14.24,3.0,Suggest unifying it because because in India I have seen people go crazy about Pokémon cocaine but if you if you like gamify plastic then they might just go crazy about that instead of NS like.

36283,PS1,6,486.12,489.76,3.64,4.0,I think it should be much awaited just by money.
36283,PS1,6,489.76,493.88,4.12,4.0,Maybe we need to if it if it would very cheap.
36283,PS1,6,493.88,502.6,8.72,4.0,A technology exists to let's see to take this plastic to measure to collect it and to to collect some kind of or make some return to your account.
36283,PS1,6,503.68,513.28,9.6,4.0,"Because of the weight, how many plastic you collect during demands for example 1K2K, you just only take a part throw it in the on the some you know a vendor apparat like a."

36283,PS1,6,540.16,540.64,0.48,3.0,"Away, Yeah."
36283,PS1,6,540.76,542.64,1.88,3.0,And then like dispose.

36283,PS1,6,559.12,564.36,5.24,4.0,"You should not go somewhere else, you know, in Germany to utilize a lump or medicine."
36283,PS1,6,564.36,565.36,1.0,4.0,It's a crazy thing.
36283,PS1,6,565.44,567.76,2.32,4.0,You need to go some special place whatsoever.
36283,PS1,6,568.08,577.28,9.2,4.0,"But if this small opera somewhere you just only drop it down, put your credit card and 110 cent is on your account immediately."

36283,PS1,6,577.6,578.08,0.48,2.0,Reimbursement.
36283,PS1,6,580.0,583.72,3.72,4.0,"Yeah, because money can motivate people to do something."
36283,PS1,6,583.72,583.84,0.12,4.0,But.
36283,PS1,6,583.96,591.4,7.44,5.0,"If we can't give them that much money, maybe sorry for maybe you can add some like, you know, like people like like mystery bots and."
36283,PS1,6,591.72,592.88,1.16,3.0,Stuff maybe?
36283,PS1,6,592.92,600.12,7.2,5.0,If you get plus bottle then there will be like auto generated things that you're trying to collect like how you collect stamps a card.

36283,PS1,6,601.52,603.36,1.84,5.0,It's like other than monetary things.
36283,PS1,6,603.92,604.16,0.24,4.0,OK.
36283,PS1,6,604.16,613.6,9.44,4.0,"So it's a, they say in in Germany, there is some, some operates not only in, in, in, in, in Germany, which can collect your plastic bottles, but it's not enough plastic bottles."
36283,PS1,6,613.6,615.84,2.24,4.0,"It's only a very, very partial problem."
36283,PS1,6,616.6,618.84,2.24,1.0,"Should we make OK, this is probably not a good time there."
36283,PS1,6,618.88,636.4,17.52,3.0,Is also that problem of like how waste gets shipped to poor countries for segregation like most of the waste is actually generated in like all the developed countries and how it just gets shipped to be segregated to poor countries like.
36283,PS1,6,636.92,639.6,2.68,1.0,So that's like the justice justice issue of the of.
36283,PS1,6,640.28,647.76,7.48,4.0,"The issue, but we have more or less a minute and I really like the idea #2 and #3 maybe we can combine them together."
36283,PS1,6,648.16,655.56,7.4,4.0,Are these some some kind of Organism or some new material which may utilize?
36283,PS1,6,656.32,658.24,1.92,3.0,"Yeah, I think, I think we can."
36283,PS1,6,658.48,658.88,0.4,3.0,We can.
36283,PS1,6,659.32,659.92,0.6,4.0,This is the.
36283,PS1,6,660.2,667.76,7.56,1.0,"Absolutely I would argue that even even though I mean certain ideas are better than others, but maybe the the 7th 1 is probably most creative I would argue because of the way that it's."
36283,PS1,6,669.08,671.8,2.72,2.0,"Drones that can track, like fly."
36283,PS1,6,672.08,672.4,0.32,3.0,Let's.

36283,PS1,6,673.4,674.84,1.44,1.0,"Let's not, let's not have a drone down."
36283,PS1,6,674.84,675.12,0.28,1.0,I guess that.
36283,PS1,6,675.12,675.28,0.16,3.0,2
36283,PS1,6,678.76,679.84,1.08,5.0,Others useful but not.
36283,PS1,6,680.36,680.76,0.4,1.0,That creative?
36283,PS1,6,681.52,683.04,1.52,3.0,I think that's the most creative one.
36283,PS1,6,683.4,684.0,0.6,1.0,I will go for this.
35177,PS3,6,1.68,6.48,4.8,1.0,That is transmitted by the same.
35177,PS3,6,9.24,19.96,10.72,2.0,"Wow, apology the UK will be the."
35177,PS3,6,22.56,23.24,0.68,3.0,First country to.
35177,PS3,6,23.88,26.08,2.2,2.0,Go and then Canada.
35177,PS3,6,31.68,33.44,1.76,2.0,"Yeah, that's just the very English Centre 1."
35177,PS3,6,33.44,34.4,0.96,2.0,You just need either.
35177,PS3,6,34.56,46.6,12.04,1.0,"Yeah, just apology the same like I apologize, but is that, I mean, why is that not, is that like random?"
35177,PS3,6,50.32,62.92,12.6,3.0,"But maybe, you know, so like when they were talking about the pandemic, they were talking about this like sort of like Swiss cheese approach of like trying to like block the spread of the virus."
35177,PS3,6,62.92,71.52,8.6,3.0,"So maybe like one thing to be you can't apologise, but then maybe the best thing to do we feel sorry is."
35177,PS3,6,71.52,72.6,1.08,1.0,Is isolate.
35177,PS3,6,74.36,75.96,1.6,3.0,Or like use like a hand desk only?
35177,PS3,6,76.72,77.24,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, Hand."
35177,PS3,6,77.84,78.0,0.16,2.0,Desk.
35177,PS3,6,78.0,84.64,6.64,2.0,"Yeah, well, just to better feel a new sign language in any case."
35177,PS3,6,100.4,104.6,4.2,3.0,But then people could accidentally like maybe read the word sorry when they're looking at.
35177,PS3,6,106.04,106.88,0.84,2.0,By saying the word.
35177,PS3,6,106.96,107.8,0.84,2.0,Saying the word.
35177,PS3,6,108.12,108.28,0.16,3.0,Sorry.
35177,PS3,6,108.28,108.8,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, but what?"
35177,PS3,6,109.08,110.0,0.92,3.0,They were reading out loud.
35177,PS3,6,110.0,110.36,0.36,2.0,That's true.
35177,PS3,6,110.72,111.24,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, you have."
35177,PS3,6,111.4,111.48,0.08,4.0,To.
35177,PS3,6,112.4,114.44,2.04,2.0,"No, you have to plan for things go wrong."
35177,PS3,6,114.44,118.08,3.64,2.0,"Yeah, like you can make plans that don't do it, just like things could go wrong."
35177,PS3,6,118.16,120.52,2.36,2.0,"And then if you make plans, what if someone does say sorry?"
35177,PS3,6,121.76,132.28,10.52,3.0,"Should should you have like a disclaimer in front of like like highlight, sorry in text so that people don't like accidentally like say it?"
35177,PS3,6,133.48,135.0,1.52,1.0,Like a or redacted.
35177,PS3,6,135.04,135.36,0.32,4.0,ID.
35177,PS3,6,136.0,137.24,1.24,1.0,Card or something?
35177,PS3,6,138.96,140.76,1.8,2.0,That could be interesting.
35177,PS3,6,141.2,143.8,2.6,2.0,You just don't write sorry ever in text.
35177,PS3,6,144.12,146.84,2.72,2.0,"And of course, if it's that you do not."
35177,PS3,6,146.84,148.28,1.44,1.0,Use the S word.
35177,PS3,6,160.04,166.04,6.0,2.0,Imagine a few days to say sorry and then you go get spread the pandemic and then you say sorry again because it spread the pandemic.
35177,PS3,6,166.92,167.8,0.88,2.0,It's just going to be a little.
35177,PS3,6,168.2,169.92,1.72,1.0,You're just there as a constant.
35177,PS3,6,172.92,184.96,12.04,5.0,"So we could, we could use flash cards like individuals who have flash cards with them so, so that it reminds them and they can also use it when they want to."
35177,PS3,6,185.08,185.68,0.6,3.0,Say sorry.
35177,PS3,6,186.96,187.28,0.32,5.0,Sorry.
35177,PS3,6,196.28,200.72,4.44,3.0,"Yeah, I guess like and assigns something."
35177,PS3,6,204.12,218.92,14.8,2.0,"Yeah, I'm just going to think about if you Day 2 say it and it does, I mean, I suppose then you're back to actual pandemic measures of acceleration."
35177,PS3,6,219.24,220.52,1.28,1.0,And of you being isolated.
35177,PS3,6,220.84,221.64,0.8,2.0,For a policy right.
35177,PS3,6,222.68,225.2,2.52,1.0,You know.
35177,PS3,6,233.0,237.64,4.64,5.0,Sensitisation also can reduce.
35177,PS3,6,237.64,238.04,0.4,3.0,Its weight.
35177,PS3,6,253.82,256.5,2.68,2.0,"You know, what will be difficult is how do you sensitize?"
35177,PS3,6,256.5,262.22,5.72,2.0,Because you say you can't say the word sorry that you're saying the word sorry to tell people that you can't.
35177,PS3,6,262.82,264.34,1.52,2.0,I mean you could write it down you.
35177,PS3,6,264.34,265.62,1.28,4.0,Sensitizing don't have the disease.
35177,PS3,6,265.78,266.02,0.24,4.0,You don't.
35177,PS3,6,266.02,266.3,0.28,4.0,"Yeah, you."
35177,PS3,6,266.74,283.16,16.42,1.0,"Have to use the word because you I mean all of us knew when it was that we shouldn't for example, like meet up, mask up, etcetera, etcetera."
35177,PS3,6,283.16,285.08,1.92,1.0,So same thing I think only.
35177,PS3,6,285.24,286.92,1.68,4.0,Only those infected can spread.
35177,PS3,6,286.92,290.24,3.32,4.0,"So if I'm not infected, I can't sensitize."
35177,PS3,6,290.24,290.96,0.72,4.0,I'm infected actually.
35177,PS3,6,290.96,293.76,2.8,2.0,Exactly what I was thinking.
35177,PS3,6,293.76,294.72,0.96,2.0,We did put sex shop.
35177,PS3,6,294.8,297.92,3.12,2.0,I suppose I it's not sure would be a problem.
35177,PS3,6,298.32,300.52,2.2,2.0,You don't know if it's present or via video colleague.
35177,PS3,6,300.56,305.08,4.52,2.0,"Like if you're on phone you say sorry, it's someone to make up the I don't know."
35177,PS3,6,305.36,306.24,0.88,4.0,"You've said, oh, hey."
35177,PS3,6,306.28,307.8,1.52,1.0,"Yeah, that's actually a good point."
35177,PS3,6,307.8,308.64,0.84,1.0,"I thought of that, yeah."
35177,PS3,6,308.88,309.76,0.88,4.0,What coming?
35177,PS3,6,309.76,311.96,2.2,2.0,In on the phone and I say sorry.
35177,PS3,6,312.52,313.76,1.24,1.0,And then what like do you get?
35177,PS3,6,313.92,314.6,0.68,4.0,It's by saying the.
35177,PS3,6,314.64,315.24,0.6,2.0,"Word Yeah, I."
35177,PS3,6,315.24,316.68,1.44,1.0,Didn't say then probably.
35177,PS3,6,316.68,317.32,0.64,4.0,You said the word.
35177,PS3,6,317.64,318.12,0.48,2.0,Probably.
35177,PS3,6,318.4,318.76,0.36,2.0,Probably.
35177,PS3,6,318.76,322.88,4.12,4.0,"The only thing is, if you write it, yeah, you read it, that's a."
35177,PS3,6,322.88,323.24,0.36,2.0,Different.
35177,PS3,6,323.24,325.68,2.44,2.0,You could sensorize by by text as yeah.
35177,PS3,6,329.84,330.92,1.08,4.0,This might be radical.
35177,PS3,6,331.08,331.52,0.44,2.0,Or anything.
35177,PS3,6,332.16,339.72,7.56,4.0,I think the best thing would be calling those that are infected.
35177,PS3,6,341.48,342.64,1.16,4.0,"No, no, OK."
35177,PS3,6,342.72,342.92,0.2,4.0,These.
35177,PS3,6,344.2,353.32,9.12,4.0,"Yeah, calling them like isolating them and then while they are still undergoing treatments, they sensitize them very well."
35177,PS3,6,354.0,355.72,1.72,4.0,"On Yeah, absolutely."

35042,PS4,3,117.88,127.96,10.08,1.0,"Because despite like, technology being good for increasing access, there would still be an inequality of quality because it's always better to have a teacher."
35042,PS4,3,129.2,132.96,3.76,1.0,"Well, maybe if the teacher is online and it's not just a video."

35042,PS4,3,142.4,146.04,3.64,1.0,"But yeah, that's I think that's a good way of also like getting around."
35042,PS4,3,146.52,146.8,0.28,2.0,The like the.
35042,PS4,3,147.32,148.84,1.52,1.0,The dropping resources.
35042,PS4,3,148.88,151.96,3.08,3.0,Because also playing a plane and dropping books couldn't be expensive.
35042,PS4,3,151.96,152.48,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35042,PS4,3,152.48,153.24,0.76,2.0,It's dangerous as well.
35042,PS4,3,154.84,155.88,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, definitely."
35042,PS4,3,155.88,157.36,1.48,2.0,"Yeah, no, I like the idea."
35042,PS4,3,157.36,162.44,5.08,2.0,"I just think, are we trying to come up with, are we trying to come up with the best idea or the most creative?"
35042,PS4,3,162.44,163.48,1.04,2.0,Do you know what I mean?
35042,PS4,3,163.48,164.12,0.64,2.0,That's a good.
35042,PS4,3,164.24,165.32,1.08,2.0,That was what I was thinking.
35042,PS4,3,165.44,167.08,1.64,1.0,"I guess it's the best solution, right?"
35042,PS4,3,167.16,169.56,2.4,1.0,It is the best 11 creative idea to overcome.
35042,PS4,3,169.56,173.04,3.48,1.0,I guess one could be either of like the ones we've come up with.
35042,PS4,3,174.24,178.12,3.88,2.0,Because she's trying to measure creativity and ideas in AI and humans.
35042,PS4,3,178.28,187.4,9.12,1.0,There's a guy in Peru who has a like a social enterprise that I think like he gives like computers to different schools in rural areas.
35042,PS4,3,188.44,189.56,1.12,2.0,"Yeah, it's been done before, like."
35042,PS4,3,189.96,193.52,3.56,1.0,But I think the computers have like the content pre loaded onto them.
35042,PS4,3,193.76,194.24,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
35042,PS4,3,194.6,195.16,0.56,1.0,And.
35042,PS4,3,195.72,197.2,1.48,3.0,And then you have like a teacher that.
35042,PS4,3,197.4,202.96,5.56,1.0,"Yeah, a teacher that helps them like learn, but but I guess is that the one idea?"
35042,PS4,3,204.04,204.72,0.68,2.0,"I mean, yeah."
35042,PS4,3,204.72,206.56,1.84,2.0,"I mean, I think it's a good idea."
35042,PS4,3,208.32,208.96,0.64,2.0,I don't mind.
35042,PS4,3,209.96,210.92,0.96,2.0,I think right now it's but.
35042,PS4,3,210.92,213.32,2.4,1.0,"That's not creative because we're just copying it, yeah."
35042,PS4,3,214.52,216.48,1.96,2.0,"Yeah, I see the ambulance one."
35042,PS4,3,216.48,216.96,0.48,2.0,I think that's.
35042,PS4,3,216.96,218.2,1.24,1.0,Maybe the ambulance one?
35042,PS4,3,218.24,218.84,0.6,2.0,That's more crazy.
35042,PS4,3,218.84,219.16,0.32,2.0,It's like.
35042,PS4,3,219.16,220.64,1.48,1.0,The teacher goes in once.
35042,PS4,3,221.2,233.28,12.08,1.0,The teacher goes in once a once a week and brings the preloaded computers and then the next week brings in another set of computers with a new contest for the next week and so you have to pick up the the computer.
35042,PS4,3,233.28,233.6,0.32,3.0,"'S back, yeah."
35042,PS4,3,233.64,234.0,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35042,PS4,3,234.08,238.48,4.4,1.0,"And so you have one, one human interaction per week of the teacher."
35042,PS4,3,238.56,247.6,9.04,1.0,"And then, and then there should be a community facilitator anyways to help the kids navigate the content in the computer, right?"
35042,PS4,3,248.12,254.16,6.04,3.0,"This inequality, educational inequality is that an equal distribution of academic resources."
35042,PS4,3,254.72,256.56,1.84,1.0,To disadvantage and marginalized groups.
35042,PS4,3,256.92,260.6,3.68,3.0,"What we're trying to do is distribute more academic resources, computers."
35042,PS4,3,261.08,262.16,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, but also teaching."
35042,PS4,3,262.68,263.24,0.56,3.0,Teaching.
35042,PS4,3,263.4,266.2,2.8,1.0,Teachers Books.
35042,PS4,3,267.36,274.8,7.44,3.0,"But our idea, our idea to overcome inequality is disappear inequality."
35042,PS4,3,275.52,276.08,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, of course."
35042,PS4,3,276.36,276.96,0.6,1.0,That's the thing.
35042,PS4,3,276.96,282.0,5.04,1.0,"Like you want to, you want this inequality to disappear by bringing the resources to those who don't have them."
35042,PS4,3,282.68,288.04,5.36,1.0,"And many times it's because, well, many times it's because there's not enough money to set up a school."
35042,PS4,3,288.88,289.64,0.76,1.0,There's not an.
35042,PS4,3,289.64,289.88,0.24,3.0,Ongoing.
35042,PS4,3,290.88,296.2,5.32,1.0,"Yeah, and to have a many times you don't have someone in the town who is qualified enough to be a teacher."
35042,PS4,3,297.68,302.52,4.84,1.0,And so that's why I thought of the ambulance as a qualified teacher going around the different towns.
35042,PS4,3,302.64,310.24,7.6,3.0,What about if we use AI like PUT that these computers are edge computing with AIS that work on the computer so they don't have to connect to the cloud?
35042,PS4,3,310.24,310.56,0.32,1.0,Localized.
35042,PS4,3,311.32,315.56,4.24,3.0,And then they can be AI specializing in each subject so they can ask the.
35042,PS4,3,315.56,318.04,2.48,1.0,"Computer, but they do have to have the content preloaded."
35042,PS4,3,318.36,322.88,4.52,3.0,To load preloaded content with AI teachers that will help them with questions.
35042,PS4,3,322.92,323.92,1.0,1.0,I love how you're writing it.
35042,PS4,3,323.92,326.4,2.48,1.0,It's like very clear.
35042,PS4,3,327.24,328.24,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, it's."
35042,PS4,3,328.92,330.2,1.28,3.0,"Yeah, they're ready to avoid."
35042,PS4,3,331.36,335.68,4.32,1.0,"Yeah, a teacher goes in once a week and brings a free load of computers, and then the next week brings."
35042,PS4,3,335.68,335.8,0.12,2.0,A new.
35042,PS4,3,335.88,339.16,3.28,1.0,Set of free loaders within with the new set of content for the week.
35042,PS4,3,339.32,340.44,1.12,3.0,"Yes, you bring it USD."
35042,PS4,3,340.8,347.76,6.96,1.0,And then someone in the town is appointed to be the facilitator and will help the students navigate that content.
35042,PS4,3,349.28,360.08,10.8,1.0,"And this teacher in the ambulance, not only did they bring the content, but they also give a class that day that helped them talk about what they read that."
35042,PS4,3,360.16,363.2,3.04,3.0,"Week they have to be generalist, so where you have to switch?"
35042,PS4,3,363.36,368.16,4.8,1.0,"Yeah, that's probably like for for like school education."
35042,PS4,3,368.36,371.8,3.44,1.0,"Up until at least primary school, you can be pretty generalist."
35042,PS4,3,371.8,375.88,4.08,1.0,"But then in high school, yeah, I think it could work."
35042,PS4,3,377.08,382.32,5.24,1.0,Maybe for high school we have to move to the contact.
35042,PS4,3,383.4,393.56,10.16,3.0,"I think that the preloaded computers could be then the this part could be not like a new computer, you can just use a USB maybe."
35042,PS4,3,394.52,396.44,1.92,1.0,"True, we don't need to bring a computer every day."
35042,PS4,3,397.72,403.8,6.08,1.0,"You are right, they already have the computers, they just bring in like Ausb or some drive with the content."
35042,PS4,3,404.08,404.52,0.44,3.0,That's true.
35042,PS4,3,404.6,406.84,2.24,3.0,"The first time, yes they have the pre loaded computer."
35042,PS4,3,407.68,411.6,3.92,3.0,The second time they bring the updated content for those computers.
35042,PS4,3,415.12,424.64,9.52,1.0,I think this is a good idea because it takes into account like cost effectiveness of the solution and trying to reach as many people as possible with quality education.
35042,PS4,3,424.8,425.16,0.36,1.0,Yes.
35042,PS4,3,425.72,429.64,3.92,3.0,"I would also, I don't know if you guys think the same but I'd like to add in this sentence."
35042,PS4,3,429.64,435.08,5.44,3.0,Teacher goes in once a week and brings a preloaded computer with subjects and AI teachers.
35042,PS4,3,435.84,438.12,2.28,1.0,Like the the content and an AI.
35042,PS4,3,438.64,442.32,3.68,3.0,"Yeah, an AI in the computer that's not connected to the cloud that can help."
35042,PS4,3,442.32,443.4,1.08,1.0,Like an AI tutor.
35042,PS4,3,443.92,444.56,0.64,3.0,AI Tutor.
35042,PS4,3,444.68,445.0,0.32,1.0,Exactly.
35042,PS4,3,445.28,450.04,4.76,1.0,It's what they're doing right now in the with content for higher education.
35042,PS4,3,450.76,450.92,0.16,2.0,Really.
35042,PS4,3,451.44,452.84,1.4,1.0,Like a lot of the digital.
35042,PS4,3,453.08,456.48,3.4,3.0,It comes with a non hallucin hallucinating tutor.
35042,PS4,3,456.72,460.64,3.92,1.0,"Yeah, it's like it it, it guides you through the content, helps you answer questions."
35042,PS4,3,460.72,461.16,0.44,1.0,It's like.
35042,PS4,3,461.28,462.0,0.72,3.0,It's going to know if.
35042,PS4,3,462.0,463.96,1.96,1.0,"You ask it like, I don't understand this."
35042,PS4,3,463.96,466.0,2.04,1.0,"It'll tell you, it'll explain."
35042,PS4,3,468.0,474.2,6.2,1.0,"But honestly, this would only work for like slightly older children or smaller children."
35042,PS4,3,474.2,474.8,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, they're going to."
35042,PS4,3,474.8,475.8,1.0,1.0,You need a different type of.
35042,PS4,3,476.08,479.84,3.76,3.0,"Of education, but it could be verbal verbal tutor that you can talk to."
35042,PS4,3,480.44,480.96,0.52,1.0,Yeah.
35042,PS4,3,480.96,481.68,0.72,1.0,"OK, OK, OK."
35042,PS4,3,482.0,487.08,5.08,1.0,It would need to be conversational like verbal and conversational.
35042,PS4,3,488.32,490.16,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, I think this is good, OK."
35042,PS4,3,491.08,498.72,7.64,1.0,"And I guess we're not saying it's like in rural areas, but maybe it's yeah, understanding it."
35042,PS4,3,499.04,500.44,1.4,2.0,As if someone in the rural village.
35042,PS4,3,500.8,501.04,0.24,1.0,Will be.
35042,PS4,3,501.28,503.8,2.52,2.0,"The facilitator who will support the students, OK."
35042,PS4,3,504.0,504.32,0.32,3.0,So it's.
35042,PS4,3,504.32,505.72,1.4,2.0,Implied implicitly.
35042,PS4,3,505.96,506.92,0.96,1.0,"I think we, yeah."
35399,PS5,3,1.76,26.7,24.94,1.0,"OK, interesting."
35399,PS5,3,32.12,48.16,16.04,2.0,"I'm a bad person, so I would say we can give people a big like when they start work, initially we gave them a huge sum of money to entice them and then they sign a contract."
35399,PS5,3,48.6,51.36,2.76,2.0,"But if they leave, then we like send them to jail."
35399,PS5,3,52.36,55.16,2.8,1.0,"Oh my gosh, yeah, that's."
35399,PS5,3,56.64,57.92,1.28,2.0,"That must be creative, that's what."
35399,PS5,3,57.92,59.0,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35399,PS5,3,59.16,59.72,0.56,3.0,Unhinged.
35399,PS5,3,59.72,69.6,9.88,3.0,"They they need, the only one I came up with is I'm not sure to what extent creative, but I would just like give like pay raises and bonuses on the various times."
35399,PS5,3,69.6,70.44,0.84,3.0,You never know.
35399,PS5,3,72.64,74.64,2.0,2.0,"So like it's like a surprise, like you get so."
35399,PS5,3,74.72,81.84,7.12,3.0,"Like maybe if I was like, for example, think, oh, I didn't get a pay raise like for like half a year, so maybe it will be in the next day."
35399,PS5,3,81.84,82.96,1.12,3.0,So you're always like.
35399,PS5,3,83.64,84.84,1.2,2.0,But what if for the next?
35399,PS5,3,84.84,88.68,3.84,2.0,I'm just wondering what if like I get a huge pay raise tomorrow?
35399,PS5,3,89.0,90.92,1.92,3.0,But then you can get another day as well.
35399,PS5,3,90.92,93.04,2.12,3.0,Maybe you never know.
35399,PS5,3,93.44,94.0,0.56,3.0,It's just like.
35399,PS5,3,94.48,98.04,3.56,1.0,"So the point is to like create incentives for them, right?"
35399,PS5,3,99.16,102.64,3.48,3.0,But also you can like block them from like doing that maybe.
35399,PS5,3,103.44,103.8,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35399,PS5,3,103.8,117.72,13.92,1.0,So to instant incentivize them to do like just stop to do that and also block some tainted maybe I think.
35399,PS5,3,118.32,123.92,5.6,1.0,"But I think your idea is a little bit Yeah, it's creative and interesting."
35399,PS5,3,123.92,124.64,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35399,PS5,3,124.64,124.76,0.12,1.0,But.
35399,PS5,3,125.4,126.52,1.12,2.0,Do you have any ideas?
35399,PS5,3,126.56,127.72,1.16,2.0,"I mean, we've got some time."
35399,PS5,3,127.72,129.32,1.6,2.0,We can take time to think more.
35399,PS5,3,129.76,130.36,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
35399,PS5,3,130.76,136.68,5.92,3.0,But maybe you can just like so maybe I would change the company to something else.
35399,PS5,3,136.68,144.92,8.24,3.0,So many people cannot leave like there are slaves or like how many like legally adopted so.
35399,PS5,3,148.36,150.36,2.0,2.0,So so change.
35399,PS5,3,150.44,156.64,6.2,2.0,"So change the structure essentially, and then when they join they are effectively signing."
35399,PS5,3,156.76,157.84,1.08,1.0,Sign the contract.
35399,PS5,3,159.04,160.04,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, it's like they need."
35399,PS5,3,160.04,163.04,3.0,1.0,To sign the contract and there will be.
35399,PS5,3,163.04,169.4,6.36,2.0,Something that the contract would buying them as though they become like a child and then they cannot leave.
35399,PS5,3,169.4,170.2,0.8,2.0,Is that what you're saying?
35399,PS5,3,170.2,170.4,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35399,PS5,3,171.0,172.72,1.72,3.0,"Yeah, you think it's good strongly buying?"
35399,PS5,3,172.88,174.76,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, maybe you can type some."
35399,PS5,3,175.28,177.6,2.32,3.0,"OK, we can still have some time."
35399,PS5,3,177.68,184.24,6.56,3.0,"Yeah, we can only like type 1 solution, so it must be like."
35399,PS5,3,184.24,188.68,4.44,2.0,"Specific, I know we make all companies into one big company."
35399,PS5,3,190.12,191.92,1.8,3.0,So that's that's what.
35399,PS5,3,192.12,194.56,2.44,2.0,"You have, you cannot earn any money."
35399,PS5,3,194.96,195.76,0.8,2.0,You know what I mean?
35399,PS5,3,195.84,196.2,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35399,PS5,3,196.24,196.72,0.48,3.0,Sure.
35399,PS5,3,197.68,204.08,6.4,1.0,"So we need, we don't need to like come up some details like how to combine them into just the idea, right?"
35399,PS5,3,204.08,204.2,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35399,PS5,3,204.2,205.36,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, it doesn't have to."
35399,PS5,3,205.36,207.0,1.64,3.0,Be I like your idea I think.
35399,PS5,3,207.44,207.64,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35399,PS5,3,207.64,210.36,2.72,2.0,So make all companies in one big company.
35399,PS5,3,210.6,212.52,1.92,3.0,So either work for this company or.
35399,PS5,3,213.2,213.4,0.2,2.0,Just.
35399,PS5,3,213.56,215.24,1.68,3.0,Almost on the street without cash.
35399,PS5,3,218.08,220.28,2.2,2.0,But all companies have become one.
35399,PS5,3,220.28,220.36,0.08,2.0,How?
35399,PS5,3,220.84,223.36,2.52,3.0,Cute murder.
35399,PS5,3,223.56,224.76,1.2,2.0,What about like the government?
35399,PS5,3,224.88,226.44,1.56,2.0,"OK, make, make that."
35399,PS5,3,227.32,234.48,7.16,2.0,It's essentially like a socialist country where the government owns everything and you cannot leave.
35399,PS5,3,235.52,242.08,6.56,2.0,"OK, make all companies into one big company so that if people leave then they cannot earn."
35399,PS5,3,242.4,243.76,1.36,3.0,Earning money.
35399,PS5,3,244.28,248.56,4.28,2.0,Shall we just add that so?
35399,PS5,3,248.8,250.48,1.68,1.0,How to summarize it?
35399,PS5,3,251.0,263.4,12.4,2.0,"I think you just continue the sentence, make our call and so that when so that if people need then they have no can we make earning any money?"
35399,PS5,3,269.04,273.84,4.8,2.0,"Yeah, maybe have some more we can think of other ideas if we want."
35399,PS5,3,273.84,274.64,0.8,2.0,"If not, we can but."
35399,PS5,3,274.8,276.4,1.6,3.0,"Honestly, I think it's great."
35399,PS5,3,277.56,280.72,3.16,2.0,"But what if people, like, want to start their own businesses?"
35399,PS5,3,280.72,282.44,1.72,2.0,"After that, we refuse."
35399,PS5,3,284.16,285.44,1.28,2.0,We let them start businesses.
35399,PS5,3,286.0,293.92,7.92,3.0,Like the on the basis of the government there is like you're outlawing the possibility of creating a new company.
35399,PS5,3,294.28,294.92,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35399,PS5,3,295.16,299.0,3.84,2.0,"Or you can, but it becomes part of I'll come with company XYZ."
35399,PS5,3,299.0,300.4,1.4,3.0,I I think it's just like the.
35399,PS5,3,300.6,312.92,12.32,3.0,"The main thing is you can, for example, like tell all your employees that they cannot buy from any other company that would pop up and then they will have no one to to sell the products."
35399,PS5,3,312.92,314.96,2.04,3.0,"So that will be enough, yeah."
35399,PS5,3,315.64,315.76,0.12,2.0,OK.
35399,PS5,3,316.44,329.32,12.88,2.0,So we still stick with this idea so that they cannot have any income or cannot purchase any products is that.
35399,PS5,3,329.68,335.04,5.36,1.0,"I have no, I don't have any like purchase ability or something like that."
35399,PS5,3,335.04,336.12,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, just yeah."
35399,PS5,3,336.16,337.8,1.64,2.0,"Anyway, we're not graded on Yeah."
35399,PS5,3,343.36,344.2,0.84,2.0,No services.
35399,PS5,3,344.2,346.32,2.12,2.0,"No, no, nothing."
35399,PS5,3,348.84,349.08,0.24,2.0,OK.
35399,PS5,3,349.84,350.96,1.12,1.0,So we move on to.
35399,PS5,3,351.24,351.4,0.16,2.0,Sure.
36540,PS5,3,0.84,1.6,0.76,1.0,"OK, voluntary."
36540,PS5,3,1.6,2.44,0.84,1.0,"Oh no, here we go."
36540,PS5,3,3.6,8.84,5.24,1.0,"Voluntary attrition happens when an employee decides to leave the company, resulting in the reduction of value talent in the workforce."
36540,PS5,3,9.12,17.56,8.44,1.0,Come up with one creative idea to stop voluntary pay people better and respect your employees.
36540,PS5,3,19.88,21.48,1.6,2.0,"Well, they don't do that, so the best it's great employee."
36540,PS5,3,22.04,22.68,0.64,3.0,Decides to leave the.
36540,PS5,3,23.92,26.12,2.2,1.0,"Company, I mean, yeah, if you make them want to stay."
36540,PS5,3,30.64,31.56,0.92,2.0,Here's what we're going to do.
36540,PS5,3,31.56,32.44,0.88,2.0,We're going to have an app.
36540,PS5,3,33.96,35.16,1.2,1.0,That'll keep people there.
36540,PS5,3,35.8,36.6,0.8,1.0,That'll do it.
36540,PS5,3,37.44,38.16,0.72,1.0,"They might be, you don't know."
36540,PS5,3,38.16,39.52,1.36,2.0,What's going to be in the app yet?
36540,PS5,3,39.64,39.92,0.28,1.0,Right.
36540,PS5,3,40.12,42.28,2.16,1.0,"They might be mistreated, but at least it's going."
36540,PS5,3,43.64,44.24,0.6,2.0,To be an app well.
36540,PS5,3,44.88,45.0,0.12,3.0,Good.
36540,PS5,3,45.56,50.48,4.92,2.0,But every day it's going to check your mood and.
36540,PS5,3,51.88,53.0,1.12,3.0,It's already checked my mood.
36540,PS5,3,53.76,55.08,1.32,2.0,"OK, specifically to the workplace."
36540,PS5,3,55.08,57.52,2.44,2.0,"OK, Have you guys ever used like, so we use this thing called office Vibe, right?"
36540,PS5,3,58.12,58.68,0.56,2.0,Which is really fun.
36540,PS5,3,58.68,58.8,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36540,PS5,3,58.8,61.16,2.36,2.0,I have breakfast that was useless where it was like it would ask you every two.
36540,PS5,3,61.16,61.28,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36540,PS5,3,61.68,62.64,0.96,3.0,You have office vibe?
36540,PS5,3,62.76,65.0,2.24,3.0,What the fuck that would change.
36540,PS5,3,65.16,68.64,3.48,3.0,That would be office vibe for.
36540,PS5,3,69.28,73.68,4.4,2.0,"It and so every week it sends you a bunch of questions where you have to rate your mood like, oh, like, and how much do you agree with these statements?"
36540,PS5,3,73.68,76.76,3.08,2.0,"I feel valued at my workplace blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's a bunch of statements, right?"
36540,PS5,3,76.76,83.2,6.44,2.0,"Wow, that's what The funny thing was a lot of the time when in a bad mood would go like strongly agree, strongly agree, strongly agree, blah, blah, right?"
36540,PS5,3,83.2,85.44,2.24,2.0,"And then it's like, tell us more about how you feel is like blah, blah, blah."
36540,PS5,3,85.88,93.08,7.2,2.0,"Now, the issue with Office 5 was it always gets our HR department and you could choose if you wanted to be anonymous or if you wanted to self identify for answer to each question, right?"
36540,PS5,3,93.48,96.48,3.0,2.0,"And then HR would sit down and write your responses to like your blurbs, right?"
36540,PS5,3,96.8,99.72,2.92,2.0,The only problem was that HR was part of the issue.
36540,PS5,3,99.72,101.36,1.64,2.0,They were very much like comfort avoided.
36540,PS5,3,101.36,104.16,2.8,2.0,"So like First off, it would take them like 3 months to get back to you with a response."
36540,PS5,3,105.36,106.64,1.28,2.0,"I like, sorry you submitted this."
36540,PS5,3,106.64,108.0,1.36,2.0,"And I was like, I wanted to get back to this."
36540,PS5,3,108.0,108.64,0.64,2.0,I don't want to forget.
36540,PS5,3,108.64,110.96,2.32,2.0,It was in November and this was in like March when she sent me a response.
36540,PS5,3,110.96,113.96,3.0,2.0,"And I was always like, have you spoken to your supervisor about this?"
36540,PS5,3,114.24,116.52,2.28,2.0,"And it's like the question was, do I feel comfortable with my supervisor?"
36540,PS5,3,118.24,120.52,2.28,2.0,So we need to just go further with office vibe.
36540,PS5,3,120.6,121.28,0.68,2.0,Basically.
36540,PS5,3,122.44,126.92,4.48,2.0,It's like it's something that's going to trigger if like an employee hits like a certain threshold.
36540,PS5,3,128.36,129.12,0.76,1.0,Negative threshold.
36540,PS5,3,129.36,131.96,2.6,2.0,"Yes, there needs to be some kind of a response."
36540,PS5,3,133.6,135.32,1.72,2.0,"Now the question is, what is the response going to be?"
36540,PS5,3,135.84,141.64,5.8,2.0,"Oh, it's going to be linked to performance management systems because you don't want to out an employee and just say employees and happy, right."
36540,PS5,3,141.88,149.52,7.64,2.0,"So this is going to well, this makes no sense when people it's going to be integrated with performance management systems because you know how like raises a lot of the time tied to performance."
36540,PS5,3,149.84,150.96,1.12,2.0,"Well, people."
36540,PS5,3,150.96,152.64,1.68,2.0,"Well, money isn't one of the only motivating factors."
36540,PS5,3,152.64,153.12,0.48,2.0,Nevermind.
36540,PS5,3,153.48,154.28,0.8,1.0,It's one big one.
36540,PS5,3,154.48,154.72,0.24,2.0,Right.
36540,PS5,3,154.72,162.08,7.36,2.0,"So like, you know, what if the add anonymity part, that's a problem because you can't just be like, oh, Amanda's dangerously close to quitting, right?"
36540,PS5,3,162.56,162.92,0.36,1.0,Because that's.
36540,PS5,3,162.92,165.28,2.36,2.0,"Kind of adding Amanda, unless you want them to know that."
36540,PS5,3,165.6,169.72,4.12,2.0,"So like, what are the interventions that we could have when someone is dangerously low?"
36540,PS5,3,170.04,172.48,2.44,2.0,This thing should track why you're unhappy as well.
36540,PS5,3,172.48,173.76,1.28,3.0,Like fucking coupons.
36540,PS5,3,174.16,182.64,8.48,2.0,"Maybe right, so that like the company at the company can like choose a certain number of credits, right and then you can kind of like, but then people will learn and game the system."
36540,PS5,3,182.64,187.32,4.68,1.0,"Exactly because then they could just say like, oh, I'm like unhappy every day, let me get the free massages."
36540,PS5,3,188.28,191.52,3.24,2.0,"Right, which is why it's gonna be linked to performance if it's a high performing employee, right."
36540,PS5,3,191.52,199.0,7.48,2.0,"It's a performance management system, OK, employee mood system if certain employees have certain performance, then they have their credit internally."
36540,PS5,3,199.0,201.6,2.6,2.0,It's all gonna be internal so nobody can see it so that it can't be biased.
36540,PS5,3,201.92,202.28,0.36,2.0,You know you're.
36540,PS5,3,203.0,203.64,0.64,1.0,"Not loving it, right?"
36540,PS5,3,204.24,204.76,0.52,1.0,"No, no, no."
36540,PS5,3,204.76,206.48,1.72,1.0,"I think it's a creative idea, that's for sure."
36540,PS5,3,206.48,206.56,0.08,1.0,It.
36540,PS5,3,206.72,207.84,1.12,2.0,Doesn't have to be practical.
36540,PS5,3,207.84,208.6,0.76,1.0,"No, that's the truth."
36540,PS5,3,209.16,215.24,6.08,1.0,"OK, I'm like, I'm like, what if there?"
36540,PS5,3,216.04,218.68,2.64,1.0,What if they're performing poorly because they're unhappy?
36540,PS5,3,219.36,220.56,1.2,1.0,Then they don't get any benefit.
36540,PS5,3,220.56,220.72,0.16,1.0,They're.
36540,PS5,3,220.88,222.72,1.84,2.0,"At that point, honestly, then they shouldn't be."
36540,PS5,3,222.72,226.12,3.4,2.0,That's not the point.
36540,PS5,3,226.24,226.36,0.12,2.0,But.
36540,PS5,3,227.32,228.68,1.36,1.0,Then they shouldn't voluntarily.
36540,PS5,3,228.68,228.92,0.24,1.0,Then it's.
36540,PS5,3,229.68,230.68,1.0,2.0,It's a paper for everyone.
36540,PS5,3,230.68,236.28,5.6,3.0,"Yeah, voluntary, because like, if they want the choice person to leave, yeah, so then fucking leave."
36540,PS5,3,236.44,237.44,1.0,3.0,But they don't want to talk.
36540,PS5,3,237.44,239.76,2.32,3.0,They're not talking those people.
36540,PS5,3,239.88,243.08,3.2,3.0,They were talking about people who are good and they want to leave for better.
36540,PS5,3,243.16,244.48,1.32,3.0,"Fortunately, we want to stop them."
36540,PS5,3,245.24,247.36,2.12,2.0,And this starts as soon as employees are on boarded.
36540,PS5,3,247.36,249.8,2.44,2.0,This is like this is part of their employee package.
36540,PS5,3,249.8,251.84,2.04,2.0,So they won't get that chance to reach that point.
36540,PS5,3,251.84,253.8,1.96,2.0,It's a proactive measure.
36540,PS5,3,254.2,258.8,4.6,2.0,It's what's the other word for proactive before preventative?
36540,PS5,3,258.84,260.24,1.4,2.0,It's a preventative measure app.
36540,PS5,3,260.44,265.28,4.84,2.0,"So and then it can ask them like when it says like say that like their, their mood goes to like down like certain threshold."
36540,PS5,3,265.28,267.04,1.76,2.0,"Wow, your mood has dipped below 75."
36540,PS5,3,267.32,270.0,2.68,2.0,"And then there can be like check boxes of like, what is it that's bothering you?"
36540,PS5,3,270.2,271.12,0.92,2.0,Is it salary?
36540,PS5,3,271.24,272.08,0.84,2.0,Is it training?
36540,PS5,3,272.08,273.16,1.08,2.0,"Is it blah, blah, blah."
36540,PS5,3,273.4,274.24,0.84,2.0,And then what is this?
36540,PS5,3,274.68,276.6,1.92,3.0,Thing my girlfriend bought with me.
36540,PS5,3,277.72,282.0,4.28,2.0,"That's their own problem because like if they're going to quit their job because of that, you can't help that, right?"
36540,PS5,3,282.0,283.6,1.6,2.0,We could only control what we can as a company.
36540,PS5,3,283.68,286.2,2.52,2.0,"So if it's like a salary thing, then maybe it's like pinged, right?"
36540,PS5,3,286.36,288.44,2.08,2.0,And then that's like fed into the AI.
36540,PS5,3,288.44,289.96,1.52,2.0,That's going to be like keep a note on this.
36540,PS5,3,290.16,293.28,3.12,2.0,"And then it's like, OK, well, if it's like training, you don't feel like getting the."
36540,PS5,3,293.28,296.28,3.0,3.0,Guy basically right now that's OK.
36540,PS5,3,297.52,298.2,0.68,2.0,Something like that.
36540,PS5,3,298.88,301.32,2.44,2.0,But also it's but it's self reporting.
36540,PS5,3,301.96,306.12,4.16,2.0,"It's self reporting, you know, so like they could lie if they just like they just put like the middle one, right."
36540,PS5,3,306.12,310.68,4.56,2.0,"But if they're trying to express because also The thing is like if an employee wants to leave, right, Sometimes they're going to leave."
36540,PS5,3,310.68,316.12,5.44,2.0,"But if they think that the company could do something about it, I feel like a lot of the time attrition happens because they think the company will do something and the company lets them down."
36540,PS5,3,316.16,319.56,3.4,2.0,So what this is doing is giving them the chance to like OK question.
36540,PS5,3,319.64,324.84,5.2,1.0,"Oh I was going to ask, does it need to be self reported or can it be like some neurological something or other?"
36540,PS5,3,324.84,324.88,0.04,1.0,Oh.
36540,PS5,3,325.48,326.04,0.56,2.0,It's creative.
36540,PS5,3,326.04,326.8,0.76,2.0,Put that shit in there.
36540,PS5,3,329.0,329.76,0.76,2.0,Put that in there.
36540,PS5,3,330.24,332.56,2.32,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36540,PS5,3,332.56,338.36,5.8,3.0,"And then if there's human intervention in this, OK, then there's chances of, you know, malpractices."
36540,PS5,3,338.64,338.72,0.08,2.0,To.
36540,PS5,3,339.08,339.88,0.8,3.0,Do some shit or other.
36540,PS5,3,341.32,345.88,4.56,3.0,"What if like your mom, like everybody does stuff on their office laptop, right?"
36540,PS5,3,346.0,346.28,0.28,2.0,Yes.
36540,PS5,3,347.16,350.64,3.48,3.0,It's taking the data out there like integrating your mood.
36540,PS5,3,350.68,351.92,1.24,2.0,Kind of like antivirus.
36540,PS5,3,351.92,353.88,1.96,2.0,"It's just like, but now it's tracking, yeah."
36540,PS5,3,354.32,354.76,0.44,3.0,You're fine on.
36540,PS5,3,355.24,359.8,4.56,2.0,"Them essentially that that's fine at that point yeah, but sure it's like your productivity has dipped today what's wrong that's wrong."
36540,PS5,3,361.16,361.28,0.12,1.0,You've.
36540,PS5,3,361.64,363.84,2.2,2.0,Been you've been doom scrolling a lot on your professional.
36540,PS5,3,363.96,365.36,1.4,1.0,"Laptop, Are you OK?"
36540,PS5,3,366.12,368.72,2.6,1.0,"Yeah, you have a."
36540,PS5,3,369.44,370.24,0.8,3.0,Mood buddy on.
36540,PS5,3,371.56,378.76,7.2,1.0,"Oh my God, maybe we just install a chip in people when they yo man, honestly, that's what we're gonna."
36540,PS5,3,378.8,380.44,1.64,2.0,Do that We learned that the pill wasn't Do you?
36540,PS5,3,380.52,380.96,0.44,1.0,Remember that?
36540,PS5,3,380.96,382.08,1.12,1.0,"Oh, Proteus, that was weird."
36540,PS5,3,382.2,383.44,1.24,1.0,"I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, 1."
36540,PS5,3,383.52,387.36,3.84,2.0,"Of the case studies we had in class, I feel like the swallowable pill that will track your shit."
36540,PS5,3,387.56,388.68,1.12,2.0,Like I don't know what it's called something.
36540,PS5,3,388.68,389.44,0.76,2.0,Was that digital business?
36540,PS5,3,389.72,391.12,1.4,1.0,"It was digital business, Yeah."
36540,PS5,3,391.6,392.16,0.56,1.0,Class two.
36540,PS5,3,392.28,392.64,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36540,PS5,3,394.28,396.2,1.92,2.0,"No, it was a core class."
36540,PS5,3,396.2,397.12,0.92,1.0,Can we go to the next one?
36131,PS4,3,1.2,2.0,0.8,1.0,"Oh, God."
36131,PS4,3,2.12,17.7,15.58,1.0,"OK, OK, so, well, that's like outreach stuff."
36131,PS4,3,17.7,19.38,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, that's what I'm getting at."
36131,PS4,3,24.42,25.34,0.92,2.0,Create idea.
36131,PS4,3,25.34,27.06,1.72,2.0,Create this idea.
36131,PS4,3,47.51,48.35,0.84,2.0,So what is it?
36131,PS4,3,48.71,70.72,22.01,1.0,"So outreach is all the stuff that I don't know if you encounter it much actually, but there's always like loads of college stuff, whether we're bringing in like school kids and sick form kids to sort of like show them like to show them like college and Cambridge life or get them a bit involved in to make so or they do the courses of like science or humanities or whatever."
36131,PS4,3,70.72,78.4,7.68,3.0,Because they're usually they bring them from state schools so that they interior have equal access or like they're proposed.
36131,PS4,3,78.92,79.2,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,79.2,82.64,3.44,1.0,So it's sort of like to make everyone feel like they're able to apply basically.
36131,PS4,3,82.64,82.96,0.32,1.0,"OK, it's."
36131,PS4,3,89.72,90.28,0.56,3.0,It's a Hamilton.
36131,PS4,3,95.98,104.8,8.82,2.0,"Yeah, I guess they're in combination with those people probably might come from backgrounds that lack money and I think Cambridge is quite expensive."
36131,PS4,3,104.8,105.12,0.32,2.0,Is it?
36131,PS4,3,105.2,106.04,0.84,2.0,I'm not sure but.
36131,PS4,3,106.08,107.48,1.4,1.0,"It's expensive to live here, yeah."
36131,PS4,3,108.12,108.76,0.64,2.0,So I guess like.
36131,PS4,3,109.2,112.4,3.2,3.0,"Because like, you can have the fees paid by the government."
36131,PS4,3,112.72,112.84,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,113.6,113.88,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, but."
36131,PS4,3,114.52,115.4,0.88,3.0,But it's still up to me.
36131,PS4,3,116.4,120.76,4.36,1.0,"Yeah, like even even just living in college during term time for undergrads."
36131,PS4,3,121.16,123.2,2.04,3.0,But you can ask for maintenance maintenance.
36131,PS4,3,123.68,128.16,4.48,1.0,"Yeah, but maintenance probably won't cover all of it, or at least it will take your full maintenance for rent."
36131,PS4,3,128.16,133.8,5.64,1.0,"Just living in college for the 24 weeks or so, so it's pretty tight anyway."
36131,PS4,3,134.8,151.48,16.68,2.0,"So if basically if you give grants, more grants to the students directly, they still have to spend more money on the rent, but if you would build more student accommodations, you can kind of keep their money in the system somehow."
36131,PS4,3,152.4,156.6,4.2,3.0,"Yeah, maybe like college accommodation which performs."
36131,PS4,3,156.96,157.36,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,158.8,165.72,6.92,2.0,"Oh, just an how do you say an independent one?"
36131,PS4,3,165.72,173.0,7.28,2.0,"Not It's very weird to me coming from Switzerland to here, seeing everything has been like in colleges."
36131,PS4,3,173.0,174.52,1.52,2.0,But it's a very real idea.
36131,PS4,3,174.52,175.12,0.6,2.0,We don't have it.
36131,PS4,3,175.92,181.32,5.4,2.0,So just like an independent student like University of Cambridge accommodation.
36131,PS4,3,181.56,185.44,3.88,1.0,"Yeah, I mean, most uni's do work normally they don't have colleges."
36131,PS4,3,185.44,189.48,4.04,1.0,"It's like it's like here, Oxford, Durham, a couple of others I think."
36131,PS4,3,190.4,192.48,2.08,1.0,"Yeah, yes."
36131,PS4,3,192.48,197.68,5.2,1.0,"But is this, it's not about Cambridge, it's about in general, so."
36131,PS4,3,198.24,207.68,9.44,3.0,"Yeah, but we are in Cambridge and I think that's one of the most, I mean, right, although it's doesn't really international."
36131,PS4,3,210.36,211.72,1.36,1.0,So how would you phrase I don't?
36131,PS4,3,212.2,212.28,0.08,3.0,Know.
36131,PS4,3,214.44,217.16,2.72,1.0,Like is there a chance?
36131,PS4,3,218.0,225.88,7.88,2.0,It's weird to me that educational inequality is the same as unequal distribution of academic resources.
36131,PS4,3,226.72,231.16,4.44,2.0,Isn't that something else than educational inequality?
36131,PS4,3,232.28,249.52,17.24,1.0,"I mean, I mean, I sort of interpreted that as just sort of access to like high quality cheese teaching and stuff like coming away from schools, coming into uni's which would obviously interlinked with wealth and stuff because I don't."
36131,PS4,3,250.48,252.16,1.68,2.0,But academic resources?
36131,PS4,3,252.6,253.12,0.52,1.0,What's that?
36131,PS4,3,253.24,254.56,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, I mean."
36131,PS4,3,259.68,261.92,2.24,2.0,"I I guess they would mean the people, right?"
36131,PS4,3,262.04,262.6,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, that's."
36131,PS4,3,262.6,263.88,1.28,2.0,What you're saying teaching?
36131,PS4,3,263.88,266.16,2.28,1.0,But I the ideas themselves I get.
36131,PS4,3,266.16,267.16,1.0,1.0,I get what you mean I.
36131,PS4,3,267.2,285.12,17.92,3.0,"Think it's, it's implies everything like books and well, rent as well and like living in university and I've been tutoring, private tutoring access, I guess to computers as well."
36131,PS4,3,285.36,294.28,8.92,3.0,"Yeah, because I I know during the pandemic, everything was aligned and then the people just took for granted that everyone had a computer."
36131,PS4,3,294.52,294.92,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, and not."
36131,PS4,3,295.16,304.08,8.92,3.0,Everyone kind not for other computers or like maybe there's one family that has one computer and.
36131,PS4,3,304.08,306.28,2.2,1.0,Then like they've got to share it and stuff and it's not.
36131,PS4,3,306.88,314.12,7.24,2.0,But but they say here that is the unequal distribution of academic resource to disadvantage and marginalized group.
36131,PS4,3,315.8,322.8,7.0,2.0,"No, I think it's like we we give the marginalized groups more too much money, so it's inequal."
36131,PS4,3,322.8,326.12,3.32,2.0,Now come up with a creative idea to overcome this.
36131,PS4,3,327.52,327.8,0.28,1.0,No.
36131,PS4,3,329.32,329.88,0.56,2.0,Am I wrong?
36131,PS4,3,330.24,330.6,0.36,1.0,I mean.
36131,PS4,3,331.04,331.96,0.92,3.0,I think it's sadly.
36131,PS4,3,331.96,332.28,0.32,1.0,Phrased.
36131,PS4,3,332.28,336.36,4.08,1.0,"Yeah, I think they phrased it weirdly, but yeah, I know."
36131,PS4,3,336.36,340.96,4.6,1.0,"It's not going to be like, let's give less money to the disadvantaged people."
36131,PS4,3,340.96,341.68,0.72,1.0,They're not going to.
36131,PS4,3,342.0,343.0,1.0,1.0,It's not going to be that.
36131,PS4,3,346.6,347.36,0.76,3.0,It should have been.
36131,PS4,3,347.4,350.36,2.96,3.0,It's been equal distribution between I don't know.
36131,PS4,3,377.77,385.29,7.52,3.0,"I mean, if we're not talking about wealth but other like minority groups, I would say representation is important."
36131,PS4,3,385.37,385.53,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,389.57,391.13,1.56,3.0,So that would probably go without.
36131,PS4,3,394.85,410.96,16.11,1.0,"Yeah, so disadvantaged and marginalised groups, I don't know."
36131,PS4,3,413.0,421.44,8.44,3.0,It's just like the first question last time was like so general and there are so many different disadvantages that we can talk about.
36131,PS4,3,445.94,456.82,10.88,2.0,"So the problem is you want to provide academic resources to a lot to everyone that, well, basically everyone up to a certain level."
36131,PS4,3,456.82,471.88,15.06,2.0,"Right until that level, you just need to where where you need to spend like hundreds of thousands of grants on individual people because if they research or whatever."
36131,PS4,3,473.0,473.68,0.68,1.0,I just don't.
36131,PS4,3,473.68,475.84,2.16,1.0,I just don't feel it's very creative.
36131,PS4,3,476.52,476.96,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, I know."
36131,PS4,3,479.12,479.32,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,483.19,487.07,3.88,2.0,I'm sorry it's hard for me to really get this question once.
36131,PS4,3,487.19,487.95,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, no, it's a."
36131,PS4,3,488.07,489.03,0.96,1.0,It's a tricky one.
36131,PS4,3,490.55,491.23,0.68,1.0,I'm struggling.
36131,PS4,3,499.96,517.04,17.08,1.0,How about like create a government program targeting disadvantaged and marginalized groups in schools with like additional resources slash grants?
36131,PS4,3,518.76,519.44,0.68,2.0,That would be the.
36131,PS4,3,519.72,521.4,1.68,2.0,I think that would be the logic thing.
36131,PS4,3,521.96,523.4,1.44,1.0,"Yeah, I can't think about."
36131,PS4,3,524.4,525.6,1.2,1.0,I'm struggling to be creative.
36131,PS4,3,527.08,529.36,2.28,2.0,I'm not sure how there's a creative solution.
36131,PS4,3,530.08,530.24,0.16,1.0,No.
36131,PS4,3,531.24,533.6,2.36,2.0,"An idea though, doesn't have to be a solution."
36131,PS4,3,534.16,537.04,2.88,1.0,I'll type it because you've got 3 minutes left and we can finger something else.
36131,PS4,3,567.49,584.93,17.44,2.0,"Maybe instead of having this one university that has a lot of money allocated to it, spend a bit more on lower like poor universities so we have more return of investment."
36131,PS4,3,585.17,585.57,0.4,3.0,I think.
36131,PS4,3,585.57,586.89,1.32,2.0,Promote those or something?
36131,PS4,3,586.97,595.84,8.87,3.0,"If we're thinking about the UK, the main issue for me, I think it's high school because private and state school are like so different."
36131,PS4,3,596.28,596.84,0.56,1.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,598.12,600.04,1.92,3.0,"Compared to like Italy, for example."
36131,PS4,3,602.52,614.24,11.72,3.0,"So I think that's what you were saying about for high schools, because university, if you're from the UK, in theory you get a loan, right?"
36131,PS4,3,615.04,616.04,1.0,1.0,You get the tuition loan.
36131,PS4,3,616.04,622.28,6.24,3.0,"Yeah, you get you get the tuition loan and is meant to be the same price for every university."
36131,PS4,3,622.32,622.68,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,623.24,634.36,11.12,3.0,"But I think the issue comes before, because to reach university you have to have a good enough education, which usually comes from private schools, which are incredibly expensive."
36131,PS4,3,638.28,645.32,7.04,3.0,"Like I know my supervisor went to board school because like £50,000 per year, yeah."
36131,PS4,3,645.32,646.28,0.96,1.0,It's ridiculous.
36131,PS4,3,650.0,650.32,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,651.12,660.32,9.2,3.0,"And I think I I mean I'm not sure because I didn't do my high school here, but I've heard the state school are usually considered to be less quality."
36131,PS4,3,662.04,665.6,3.56,1.0,They some state schools are good and some schools are bad but worse.
36131,PS4,3,665.6,667.12,1.52,1.0,But it's sort of it's a really mixed bag.
36131,PS4,3,667.44,670.88,3.44,1.0,Whereas private schools will have good teachers.
36131,PS4,3,672.04,672.36,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,672.36,675.32,2.96,1.0,"I mean, I mean, I hear some people who went to private schools and they were like, it was bad."
36131,PS4,3,675.32,678.4,3.08,1.0,But that's the but that's the theory anyway.
36131,PS4,3,678.4,681.88,3.48,1.0,"Well, they'll have access to loads of like resources that stage doesn't get as well because of the money."
36131,PS4,3,682.28,687.84,5.56,1.0,"Just, you know, so that of all the technology and buildings and stuff and extracurriculars."
36131,PS4,3,688.84,689.08,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,689.36,690.16,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, oh God."
36131,PS4,3,690.16,690.32,0.16,1.0,Which?
36131,PS4,3,691.16,694.2,3.04,3.0,"Which then helps you for your university application though, right?"
36131,PS4,3,695.36,695.88,0.52,1.0,Yeah.
36131,PS4,3,707.44,715.24,7.8,1.0,Slash Internet apprenticeship done.
34663,PS4,6,36.36,38.96,2.6,4.0,Creative idea to overcome inequality in.
34663,PS4,6,39.24,39.84,0.6,1.0,Education Tell.
34663,PS4,6,42.04,42.8,0.76,3.0,People tell.
34663,PS4,6,43.12,45.48,2.36,2.0,Make wraps about textbook stuff.
34663,PS4,6,47.6,47.76,0.16,2.0,What?
34663,PS4,6,47.76,49.0,1.24,2.0,"What on the wraps, right?"
34663,PS4,6,49.2,49.52,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
34663,PS4,6,50.56,50.64,0.08,5.0,So.
34663,PS4,6,51.4,52.8,1.4,1.0,"It could be a square if us, yeah."
34663,PS4,6,53.96,57.48,3.52,4.0,But it says unequal distribution of academic resources.
34663,PS4,6,58.28,61.32,3.04,2.0,"Yeah, so like essentially use."
34663,PS4,6,61.76,62.76,1.0,4.0,So using.
34663,PS4,6,63.36,71.48,8.12,2.0,"OK, using RAP using more popular in say marginalized groups and sort of use textbook ship to I don't know, have you?"
34663,PS4,6,71.92,76.12,4.2,3.0,But they should have the resources to have the access to the RAP.
34663,PS4,6,76.28,78.36,2.08,4.0,"Internet, Internet everything."
34663,PS4,6,78.96,79.8,0.84,4.0,YouTube videos.
34663,PS4,6,79.8,80.04,0.24,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34663,PS4,6,80.84,82.76,1.92,1.0,YouTube videos but like if.
34663,PS4,6,83.0,85.8,2.8,3.0,They are not affording not able to afford the textbooks.
34663,PS4,6,86.52,88.4,1.88,3.0,I Will they be able to afford it?
34663,PS4,6,90.48,92.08,1.6,4.0,Because everyone has their phone.

35260,PS3,6,87.56,87.8,0.24,3.0,They can't.
35260,PS3,6,87.8,92.88,5.08,6.0,"Just type with this then, yeah."

35260,PS3,6,108.64,115.36,6.72,5.0,"We can say, I mean, we can set a narrative to the people that you don't need to be apologetic even if you do mistake."
35260,PS3,6,116.12,121.04,4.92,2.0,Or you can just invent this on the green and you see like soul and.

35260,PS3,6,141.4,143.12,1.72,3.0,"About lockdown rules, we can also."
35260,PS3,6,143.6,145.52,1.92,5.0,We can also use a set.
35260,PS3,6,145.56,158.8,13.24,5.0,"We can also set example like let's say if somebody say sorry in public and you know, since the the disease is spread by saying sort of word, then we can directly shoot them."
35260,PS3,6,158.92,160.28,1.36,5.0,"So you know, the word spreads."
35260,PS3,6,160.4,163.68,3.28,5.0,"The I know it's kind of thing, but this is how the thing should work."
35260,PS3,6,164.8,165.16,0.36,4.0,That's the.
35260,PS3,6,165.64,167.72,2.08,5.0,It's not really happens by the.
35260,PS3,6,167.72,183.44,15.72,2.0,"Way or you could just like analyze the alphabet of the story like IPA, and then figure out like how it's been pronounced and based on that generated some like sort of electronic mask and you wear that it can automatically like."
35260,PS3,6,183.72,184.52,0.8,3.0,I love that.
35260,PS3,6,184.84,186.0,1.16,3.0,Like I love.

34326,PS1,3,863.04,864.28,1.24,1.0,"Oh, let's just do use it, right?"
34326,PS1,3,865.48,867.6,2.12,2.0,"Simple as a stop using, stop using."
34326,PS1,3,867.68,868.28,0.6,1.0,Plastic.

34326,PS1,3,872.48,873.48,1.0,1.0,Drinking out the oil.
34326,PS1,3,874.08,877.04,2.96,1.0,"So this plastic is byproduct of, Yeah."
34326,PS1,3,877.04,878.12,1.08,1.0,"Of fossil fuel, yeah."
34326,PS1,3,878.12,878.84,0.72,3.0,Fossil fuel.
34326,PS1,3,878.96,879.44,0.48,3.0,So what is the?
34326,PS1,3,879.76,881.32,1.56,3.0,What is the substitute for plastic?
34326,PS1,3,882.76,889.4,6.64,2.0,Paper bags Paper bags Produce produced by produced by trees.
34326,PS1,3,889.72,890.92,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, but let me see."
34326,PS1,3,890.96,891.36,0.4,3.0,Paper.
34326,PS1,3,891.36,892.88,1.52,3.0,I don't know is that better way?
34326,PS1,3,893.24,893.76,0.52,1.0,Yes.
34326,PS1,3,893.8,899.96,6.16,1.0,"But yeah, that will be a is answer really I would say I."
34326,PS1,3,900.16,901.28,1.12,3.0,Think the dump is smarter than?
34326,PS1,3,901.44,910.44,9.0,1.0,"That dump all the plastic to the outer space would be something that AI yeah, that ships all the plastic to the moon or to the fucking sun."
34326,PS1,3,912.0,912.88,0.88,2.0,Burn it to the sun.
34326,PS1,3,913.08,917.28,4.2,1.0,Burn it by the sun will be.
34326,PS1,3,917.52,917.72,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
34326,PS1,3,917.92,924.12,6.2,1.0,Or just send a spaceship which have no destination and travel until the end of eternity.
34326,PS1,3,924.28,925.76,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, just dump it outside of Earth."
34326,PS1,3,926.0,927.92,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, dump all the plastic outside."
34326,PS1,3,928.4,932.24,3.84,1.0,"Yeah, dump it outside of Earth, send it to Mars or whatever."
34326,PS1,3,933.44,935.88,2.44,2.0,Send it to Mars with Elon Musk together.
34326,PS1,3,938.6,939.28,0.68,2.0,That's one car.

34326,PS1,3,940.16,941.08,0.92,1.0,There's one car.
34326,PS1,3,941.72,943.56,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, he want to go to Mars, so we."
34326,PS1,3,943.96,944.08,0.12,3.0,Get.
34326,PS1,3,944.08,944.28,0.2,3.0,Oh yeah.
34326,PS1,3,944.36,944.88,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, Solution."
34326,PS1,3,946.04,948.28,2.24,2.0,"Yeah, we will form your mass mission."
34326,PS1,3,948.28,953.68,5.4,2.0,But you have to go with all the plastic and you can live with all the plastic over there.
34326,PS1,3,954.8,956.16,1.36,2.0,We can support his mission.
34326,PS1,3,956.32,956.6,0.28,1.0,OK.
34326,PS1,3,956.84,960.68,3.84,1.0,I'll put this now first because we're excited with that idea that you guys continue.
34326,PS1,3,962.88,970.36,7.48,2.0,"I think 1st, 1st and the most absolute absolute answer should be to stop using plastic."
34326,PS1,3,970.36,977.2,6.84,2.0,"Not to reduce it, not not to stop using and producing plastics, plastic."
34326,PS1,3,979.96,982.36,2.4,1.0,Waste to ultras.
34326,PS1,3,1000.13,1001.33,1.2,2.0,No final destination.
34326,PS1,3,1011.44,1020.32,8.88,2.0,"You just, you just say it's orbit the Earth like the the international, the International International Space Station."
34326,PS1,3,1021.04,1023.36,2.32,2.0,So the plastic just orbit around the Earth.
34326,PS1,3,1024.64,1026.96,2.32,1.0,Will be like subterm.
34326,PS1,3,1027.04,1029.0,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, it will be surrounded by."
34326,PS1,3,1029.36,1029.76,0.4,2.0,Plastic.
34326,PS1,3,1029.76,1034.56,4.8,1.0,"Plastic, sometimes surrounded by plastic."
34326,PS1,3,1034.84,1035.72,0.88,1.0,"Oh, that's beautiful."
34326,PS1,3,1037.8,1038.28,0.48,1.0,So I.
34326,PS1,3,1038.32,1040.56,2.24,2.0,Think one of the other approach blessing was.
34326,PS1,3,1053.04,1056.56,3.52,3.0,"Just put a tax on for the use of plastic, that's what we do."
34326,PS1,3,1057.44,1057.64,0.2,1.0,Sorry.
34326,PS1,3,1058.0,1058.72,0.72,3.0,Just put a tax.
34326,PS1,3,1058.96,1059.36,0.4,1.0,Tax.
34326,PS1,3,1059.56,1061.8,2.24,2.0,"Yeah, but that's also a common solution, right?"
34326,PS1,3,1062.0,1062.16,0.16,2.0,Like.
34326,PS1,3,1062.4,1063.76,1.36,1.0,Tax like if you.
34326,PS1,3,1063.76,1064.56,0.8,2.0,Use plastic.
34326,PS1,3,1065.08,1067.52,2.44,2.0,"If you use plastic, you pay a tax."
34326,PS1,3,1069.16,1074.48,5.32,3.0,"You know, the surprising thing is that the governments haven't really think about putting a common taxation."
34326,PS1,3,1075.4,1075.96,0.56,1.0,On plastic.
34326,PS1,3,1075.96,1076.32,0.36,3.0,Usage.
34326,PS1,3,1076.32,1078.72,2.4,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34326,PS1,3,1078.72,1079.96,1.24,2.0,You you mean just a surprise?
34326,PS1,3,1080.32,1081.48,1.16,2.0,You mean a global?
34326,PS1,3,1081.72,1083.04,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, at a global level."
34326,PS1,3,1083.04,1083.88,0.84,2.0,"Not one level, yeah."
34326,PS1,3,1084.76,1096.48,11.72,3.0,"So every country is doing their own way, but there's no uniform to say, yeah, so if I was a plastic producer, I would just shift my factories and whatever supply chains to the countries like Vietnam."
34326,PS1,3,1096.48,1102.36,5.88,3.0,"Like I don't know the countries that doesn't have this tax, so there need to be a common tax being imposed actually."
34326,PS1,3,1102.92,1103.12,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
34326,PS1,3,1104.28,1107.2,2.92,3.0,Which I'm surprised that the UN hasn't actually looked at this.
34326,PS1,3,1109.8,1113.88,4.08,2.0,"Because the UN can suggest measure, but they have no authority."
34326,PS1,3,1113.88,1114.16,0.28,3.0,To Yeah.
34326,PS1,3,1114.16,1116.8,2.64,3.0,So actually someone with the authority need to.
34326,PS1,3,1117.44,1126.08,8.64,2.0,"Yeah, have one global nation and we decide to that's all the plastic use."
34326,PS1,3,1131.52,1133.0,1.48,2.0,Under one global nation.
34326,PS1,3,1133.12,1134.2,1.08,2.0,Let's say it this way.
34326,PS1,3,1134.24,1139.24,5.0,2.0,Under one global under one global nation.
34326,PS1,3,1139.68,1140.36,0.68,1.0,Global Nation.
34326,PS1,3,1140.6,1145.68,5.08,2.0,We decide to add decide to add a tax A.
34326,PS1,3,1146.32,1146.64,0.32,1.0,Tax.
34326,PS1,3,1147.52,1155.32,7.8,2.0,Rate on the use of plastic The use of plastic and enforce it globally.
34326,PS1,3,1156.24,1158.44,2.2,1.0,Yeah and yeah.
34326,PS1,3,1160.24,1160.44,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
34326,PS1,3,1165.76,1168.24,2.48,1.0,Let's go or someone.
34326,PS1,3,1168.24,1169.48,1.24,1.0,We still have 6 minutes.
34326,PS1,3,1169.48,1170.2,0.72,1.0,We'll click on this one.
34326,PS1,3,1172.68,1173.2,0.52,2.0,"OK, what?"
34326,PS1,3,1173.32,1174.6,1.28,2.0,I don't know what you.
34326,PS1,3,1175.24,1180.52,5.28,1.0,"Remember, they say, they say just one idea, one creative idea."
34326,PS1,3,1181.36,1182.16,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, but the question."
34326,PS1,3,1182.16,1183.92,1.76,1.0,"But yeah, given the risk."
34326,PS1,3,1186.08,1188.04,1.96,2.0,The last question we could not even finish to write.
34326,PS1,3,1188.72,1189.16,0.44,1.0,Let's proceed.
34326,PS1,3,1189.24,1195.36,6.12,3.0,"Then sure, actually I think we we can advance ahead of time, right?"
34326,PS1,3,1196.32,1199.72,3.4,3.0,"You're trying next time, you're trying next time for us, you're trying next and see what it can allow us."
34326,PS1,3,1200.08,1206.28,6.2,2.0,But do you think that the the idea that we have added so far are out-of-the-box ideas?
34326,PS1,3,1206.4,1207.36,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, they're pretty because."
34326,PS1,3,1207.64,1208.6,0.96,1.0,No one has done it.
34326,PS1,3,1209.72,1211.64,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, the one from space is really out-of-the-box."
34326,PS1,3,1214.4,1222.56,8.16,2.0,"Now think about you will have to regroup pretty much all the plastic that are available on Earth, right?"
34326,PS1,3,1222.56,1227.68,5.12,2.0,You have to build a a ship that is capable to carry pretty much everything.
34326,PS1,3,1229.2,1234.84,5.64,1.0,"You know, the Elton Masses has has a has a spaceship that can be coming back and forth."
34326,PS1,3,1235.16,1238.84,3.68,3.0,"Yeah, but he ain't going to use it for this because he's going to charge people to fly there, you know?"
34326,PS1,3,1238.96,1239.48,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, that's what."
34326,PS1,3,1239.48,1239.76,0.28,1.0,The space.
34326,PS1,3,1240.0,1242.08,2.08,2.0,"Is but we, we, we, we do technologies."
34326,PS1,3,1242.56,1243.96,1.4,1.0,It sounds available now.
34326,PS1,3,1244.12,1247.0,2.88,2.0,"No, we will pay a long mass to carry the plastic with him."
34326,PS1,3,1247.2,1249.36,2.16,2.0,"No people, he's no people are going with him."
34326,PS1,3,1249.4,1250.28,0.88,2.0,Just the plastics.
34326,PS1,3,1250.52,1252.36,1.84,3.0,"He's going to charge a lot of money, but you know."
34326,PS1,3,1253.04,1258.92,5.88,2.0,"Just flex plastics, But yeah, we can move to the next question."
34326,PS1,3,1259.04,1260.04,1.0,3.0,"Yeah, we see whatever we can."
34326,PS1,3,1260.4,1260.8,0.4,1.0,Let's see.
34326,PS1,3,1261.88,1263.76,1.88,2.0,That's that we are not supposed to use our phone.
34326,PS1,3,1264.6,1265.36,0.76,3.0,"No, we're not checking."
34326,PS1,3,1265.36,1265.8,0.44,3.0,I'm not checking.
36321,PS1,6,3.56,5.28,1.72,1.0,Plastic is one of the biggest.
36321,PS1,6,12.88,15.68,2.8,2.0,"I mean, I can think of recycling, but that's not very great."
36321,PS1,6,17.56,19.04,1.48,1.0,Something that doesn't exist.
36321,PS1,6,20.04,22.76,2.72,3.0,"I mean, when they say creative, I think they mean something which does."
36321,PS1,6,22.76,32.08,9.32,2.0,Not exist or something which is out of the blue slightly like because like like right now there are these cycles right now they're also like a lot of brands are deducing plastic waste.
36321,PS1,6,32.48,37.56,5.08,2.0,You know how they're wrapping is like packaging is very different now anything that you order.
36321,PS1,6,38.2,38.92,0.72,1.0,And I was but.
36321,PS1,6,39.4,40.0,0.6,4.0,The new material.
36321,PS1,6,40.88,45.92,5.04,5.0,"To replace the degradable material, All degradable material is very expensive."
36321,PS1,6,46.12,49.04,2.92,5.0,It cannot perfectly replace the stuff.
36321,PS1,6,49.32,49.44,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36321,PS1,6,51.12,52.72,1.6,4.0,Maybe we can still use the plastic.
36321,PS1,6,53.24,54.96,1.72,4.0,We didn't consider you about other.
36321,PS1,6,55.32,56.12,0.8,6.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
36321,PS1,6,58.56,63.64,5.08,6.0,Maybe you can charge more tests on this plastic producer.
36321,PS1,6,64.24,65.04,0.8,6.0,So they will.
36321,PS1,6,65.6,68.24,2.64,6.0,"The plastic goods will become more expensive, Yeah."
36321,PS1,6,69.8,90.96,21.16,1.0,"That's but this is already implemented charge plastic bags already you create probably a positive incentive like instead of I find something an incentive not to use it, but I haven't, I haven't thought of something maybe."
36321,PS1,6,91.24,92.24,1.0,4.0,We can just transfer it.
36321,PS1,6,92.52,97.32,4.8,1.0,"Yeah, but it needs something creative so like that is not already."
36321,PS1,6,97.6,104.84,7.24,4.0,I said we can transfer the to other planet.
36321,PS1,6,108.16,108.48,0.32,2.0,Transfer.
36321,PS1,6,110.0,111.8,1.8,4.0,It on a planet that there is no.
36321,PS1,6,114.64,117.68,3.04,2.0,"That's very creative, but very costly."
36321,PS1,6,117.76,118.24,0.48,2.0,I would send.
36321,PS1,6,118.56,120.28,1.72,5.0,The plastic waste to the bars.
36321,PS1,6,123.32,130.28,6.96,4.0,"Is really popular to be studied by some countries, so we can choose a place that is on the way."
36321,PS1,6,131.6,132.48,0.88,2.0,Send it to Sun.
36321,PS1,6,141.96,151.52,9.56,1.0,"The use of plastic from manufacture, so they're not allowed to use plastic so they cannot be said it after when ban is used in general not not everybody."
36321,PS1,6,151.6,153.4,1.8,2.0,"You're not actually writing that, are you there?"
36321,PS1,6,155.64,155.8,0.16,2.0,So.
36321,PS1,6,155.8,160.44,4.64,4.0,"We're just considering the environmental problems on the Earth, right?"
36321,PS1,6,160.68,160.88,0.2,4.0,Yeah.
36321,PS1,6,162.6,162.92,0.32,2.0,That's all.
36321,PS1,6,163.12,164.0,0.88,4.0,"Right, there's no."
36321,PS1,6,165.28,168.0,2.72,2.0,"We will never, ever call us for a study again."
36321,PS1,6,168.08,169.0,0.92,2.0,Let's not write.
36321,PS1,6,169.0,170.12,1.12,2.0,That's not possible.
36321,PS1,6,177.28,180.6,3.32,2.0,"But I think I really like that idea, like finding a substitute."
36321,PS1,6,180.6,182.16,1.56,2.0,I know that's not very creative.
36321,PS1,6,182.16,188.28,6.12,2.0,"And of course, that's very like, I'm pretty sure people are researching for it already, like, but."
36321,PS1,6,188.48,196.72,8.24,5.0,"Just is there are some new material designed to replace the plastic bag, but many of them are expensive than the plastic bag."
36321,PS1,6,196.72,201.96,5.24,5.0,So they only in the startup companies but never in use what?
36321,PS1,6,202.72,209.36,6.64,1.0,But we can say that this we need to become mandatory because now it's optional.
36321,PS1,6,209.76,211.48,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, there's something I'm thinking about."
36321,PS1,6,213.24,213.6,0.36,1.0,There are.
36321,PS1,6,213.84,219.44,5.6,5.0,Also some new project to developing bacteria.
36321,PS1,6,219.44,222.76,3.32,5.0,"They can eat the plastic, they can digest them."
36321,PS1,6,223.04,223.44,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
36321,PS1,6,223.6,229.04,5.44,2.0,"In fact, when my at my undergraduate university, they were like a couple of professors were researching and they did something."
36321,PS1,6,229.56,232.64,3.08,2.0,They did find something like a plastic eating bacteria.
36321,PS1,6,234.0,234.24,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36321,PS1,6,235.76,236.24,0.48,2.0,Good way.
36321,PS1,6,236.4,236.64,0.24,1.0,"Yeah, so."
36321,PS1,6,239.64,241.68,2.04,5.0,If you use.
36321,PS1,6,244.0,244.6,0.6,6.0,A maturation.
36321,PS1,6,244.6,245.0,0.4,1.0,Degree ball.
36321,PS1,6,245.0,245.52,0.52,1.0,I'm sorry.
36321,PS1,6,246.56,247.84,1.28,6.0,Compulsory is actually nice.
36321,PS1,6,249.44,249.52,0.08,1.0,To.
36321,PS1,6,254.0,261.12,7.12,6.0,Use recycle material.
36321,PS1,6,262.36,264.92,2.56,2.0,"Not recycled, degradable material."
36321,PS1,6,264.92,273.28,8.36,2.0,"These are two different things because recyclable like it's still the owners will be on people to recycle, which is like right now also a lot of things are recyclable."
36321,PS1,6,273.28,274.12,0.84,2.0,People just don't do it.
36321,PS1,6,274.12,277.88,3.76,2.0,"But this is if it's degradable, it can just degrade on its own."
36321,PS1,6,277.92,279.0,1.08,2.0,So degradable material.
36321,PS1,6,279.24,279.76,0.52,6.0,Degradable.
36321,PS1,6,281.96,282.68,0.72,5.0,As a substitute.
36321,PS1,6,282.92,291.76,8.84,1.0,"Yeah, or it's kind of all the other, like the plastic is material because it's bacteria."
36321,PS1,6,291.8,292.56,0.76,1.0,Bacteria.
36321,PS1,6,292.76,293.76,1.0,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I."
36321,PS1,6,301.16,304.36,3.2,2.0,Think for the first one they can tell it's written by human.
36321,PS1,6,307.0,307.6,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, I'm not."
36321,PS1,6,307.6,308.16,0.56,4.0,To replace.
36321,PS1,6,308.72,308.96,0.24,2.0,Human.
36321,PS1,6,312.2,312.72,0.52,6.0,"Yeah, OK, Nash."
35914,PS1,6,1.4,4.84,3.44,1.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime.
35914,PS1,6,4.84,8.44,3.6,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic pollution.
35914,PS1,6,12.64,12.88,0.24,2.0,Stop.
35914,PS1,6,21.72,21.84,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS1,6,21.84,36.4,14.56,3.0,I mean other than the obvious sort of use other alternative materials I guess you can obviously reduce the behaviour of throwing away single use plastics as well.
35914,PS1,6,36.96,42.68,5.72,3.0,So you could like really visualize like where it actually goes.
35914,PS1,6,44.48,45.8,1.32,1.0,How would you visualize it?
35914,PS1,6,47.32,48.08,0.76,3.0,You could.
35914,PS1,6,48.2,62.92,14.72,3.0,"I mean, I saw an exhibit like recently, I was in Cape Town and they had an exhibit of like plastic collected from the Great Pacific plastic Swirlpool or all gathers."
35914,PS1,6,67.36,81.12,13.76,3.0,"And it was like basically a statistical sort of, this is point, ridiculously small number of the total plastic and it's still like an entire room ceiling to floor to ceiling."
35914,PS1,6,81.12,94.28,13.16,3.0,"So I think yeah, definitely that's another side of it that we should tackle as well, like how to reduce the behaviour of, you know, using single use plastic."
35914,PS1,6,96.04,106.48,10.44,1.0,"I feel like if you had instead of like, it will go into like a landfill or something if you started just putting it like in the streets, like it just starts piling up and then people see it."
35914,PS1,6,106.48,109.36,2.88,3.0,"Yeah, people actually see it and interact with it."
35914,PS1,6,111.0,117.52,6.52,4.0,"So we're we're reducing plastic pollution, we're not reducing plastic usage or we don't have to reduce plastic usage."
35914,PS1,6,117.64,119.64,2.0,4.0,We just have to make sure that it's not polluting.
35914,PS1,6,119.84,122.12,2.28,1.0,I also like new recycling.
35914,PS1,6,122.2,122.76,0.56,3.0,Or whatever.
35914,PS1,6,123.72,127.04,3.32,5.0,"Is what I saw like so I'm thinking about was like, is this pollutions?"
35914,PS1,6,127.04,133.2,6.16,5.0,If it's not pollutions that would be not a problem we could like could improve like the the plastic recycled technology.
35914,PS1,6,133.48,134.44,0.96,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35914,PS1,6,134.96,141.92,6.96,4.0,"Like I think recently in the lab they're growing like this actually, like plastic eating bacteria that's been like quite successful."
35914,PS1,6,141.92,147.48,5.56,4.0,"So if they manage to mass produce it, then there's a biodegradable way for plastic as well, which is very perfect."
35914,PS1,6,148.88,160.44,11.56,4.0,"One like something as an economist like would be more like, I guess targeting the supply side rather than the demand side 'cause people are already used to the habit of using a lot of the plastic like utensils."
35914,PS1,6,160.44,174.0,13.56,4.0,"So it's not going to be I think easy or like economically wise to like just target like individual usage because each one of them is going to amount to like, you know, just a very small quantity and it's going to be quite costly to implement it."
35914,PS1,6,174.28,198.76,24.48,4.0,"So if you can actually target the production side by coming up with new technologies of either breaking down the plastics or of like basically alternative technologies that are also cheap and as well as efficient such as like manufacturing paper straws at a cheaper like cost, then consumers are just naturally going to gravitate towards these alternatives rather than having to think about replacements and stuff."
35914,PS1,6,198.96,204.96,6.0,3.0,"I think for the single use plastic though, you literally like it's a really hard technical problem to actually."
35914,PS1,6,204.96,206.04,1.08,4.0,"Yeah, to like find something."
35914,PS1,6,206.04,210.52,4.48,3.0,"That's break it down like it, it will always be on a microscopic level there."
35914,PS1,6,210.6,219.6,9.0,3.0,"So I think you definitely have to use, you need to gather that and put that somewhere to good use as well."
35914,PS1,6,222.32,249.16,26.84,3.0,"If that could maybe be depending on the House, Like I'm not an ex, I'm not like a materials expert, but you could maybe reduce it down to a point where you can maybe make jewellery with it or some something that is artistic maybe to display something structural potentially."
35914,PS1,6,249.32,260.6,11.28,4.0,"I'd say making it into bricks like basically what they were doing like with like eating or breaking down the plastic is then you can convert it into like bricks for building, which obviously requires a greater quantity."
35914,PS1,6,260.88,263.92,3.04,4.0,And so it's actually easier to like used up that way.
35914,PS1,6,263.92,265.4,1.48,3.0,A real Lego house.
35914,PS1,6,266.72,266.76,0.04,6.0,I.
35914,PS1,6,267.96,269.64,1.68,5.0,Think some of the clothes are made by plastic.
35914,PS1,6,269.84,270.48,0.64,3.0,I think this one.
35914,PS1,6,270.48,270.72,0.24,5.0,Is.
35914,PS1,6,271.84,272.68,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, for sure."
35914,PS1,6,276.6,276.84,0.24,6.0,Yeah.
35914,PS1,6,276.92,292.72,15.8,6.0,"And I think in the speech of say restaurants or something like plastic could be something eatable, yeah, that you wouldn't need to kind of dispose it when yeah, done eating like."
35914,PS1,6,293.56,294.32,0.76,4.0,"Oh, like edible?"
35914,PS1,6,294.32,295.24,0.92,4.0,"Like edible, Yeah."
35914,PS1,6,296.2,296.4,0.2,6.0,Yeah.
35914,PS1,6,299.64,299.92,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35914,PS1,6,299.92,303.96,4.04,2.0,I kind of like the idea of like doing something with it rather than just the yeah.
35914,PS1,6,305.16,308.92,3.76,2.0,But also I guess the idea of like having some a technology that reduces pollution.
35914,PS1,6,308.92,312.32,3.4,2.0,It's like an all round sort of thing.
35914,PS1,6,312.6,315.4,2.8,2.0,"So I don't know, maybe there's a way we can combine those two?"
35914,PS1,6,315.72,315.96,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS1,6,317.76,331.24,13.48,4.0,So basically targeting the supply side or the production side of plastic and both diversifying its usage as well as alternative means of.
35914,PS1,6,334.52,340.36,5.84,6.0,"I think I like your idea of, you know, doing it using to create an."
35914,PS1,6,340.64,341.52,0.88,4.0,"Yeah, something and."
35914,PS1,6,342.48,346.88,4.4,6.0,"What you said about, you know, using the top brakes and I think, yeah, quite."
35914,PS1,6,347.28,347.44,0.16,4.0,Catchy.
35914,PS1,6,348.36,355.84,7.48,4.0,"But I guess the main question is if you have like plastic that's been distributed, then it's going to be kind of difficult to then collect them?"
35914,PS1,6,355.96,356.2,0.24,6.0,Yeah.
35914,PS1,6,356.76,367.12,10.36,4.0,"And then make them into something because there's different types of plastic, like the cap of the bottle is usually not made of the same material as like the bottle itself."
35914,PS1,6,367.56,378.92,11.36,3.0,"And that, that is actually a really good point, the collection point as well, like you would have to like in places like the Pacific and Indian Ocean."
35914,PS1,6,378.92,384.32,5.4,3.0,"There's another one, these big currents that collect lots and lots of plastic."
35914,PS1,6,384.32,387.56,3.24,3.0,You have to devise a way to gather all of that.
35914,PS1,6,388.16,388.36,0.2,6.0,Which?
35914,PS1,6,388.36,405.28,16.92,3.0,Is not easy so yeah you maybe yeah like potentially you could have like a using the plastic that's gathered you maybe make Nets or like.
35914,PS1,6,405.32,405.6,0.28,4.0,Some.
35914,PS1,6,406.32,412.48,6.16,3.0,"Yeah, like it's kind of like, you know, like the more you gather, the more you can gather."
35914,PS1,6,413.72,419.2,5.48,4.0,"Yeah, plastic catching machine made of."
35914,PS1,6,419.2,419.8,0.6,3.0,Plastic.
35914,PS1,6,423.52,427.28,3.76,3.0,That could be quite interesting from like a marketing point.
35914,PS1,6,433.44,433.6,0.16,4.0,Cool.
35914,PS1,6,434.92,436.2,1.28,1.0,Anything else to add?
35914,PS1,6,436.36,437.52,1.16,1.0,We still have 4 minutes.
35914,PS1,6,439.12,440.0,0.88,2.0,What have we got so far?
35914,PS1,6,440.28,452.96,12.68,1.0,"I've got improving recycling technology to repurpose waste plastic into useful materials, EG bricks for housing, utensils for restaurants, or repurposing to materials for art displays that reinforce the reduced plastic waste message."
35914,PS1,6,453.8,458.4,4.6,1.0,Use Gather plastic to create Nets or tools to create more plastic to gather more plastic from the oceans.
35914,PS1,6,458.4,461.44,3.04,1.0,Plastic has plastic catching machine made of plastic.
34250,PS1,3,0.0,950.68,0.88,3.0,"God, oh, I love that."
34250,PS1,3,950.68,950.72,0.04,3.0,Oh.
34250,PS1,3,951.04,951.8,0.76,1.0,"This is good, yeah."
34250,PS1,3,952.56,953.4,0.84,3.0,Oh I love that.
34250,PS1,3,953.76,956.8,3.04,3.0,That's usually my biggest goal in life.
34250,PS1,3,956.88,961.2,4.32,3.0,"If I could build a starter, probably this would be the one."
34250,PS1,3,961.24,961.76,0.52,1.0,"Oh, really?"
34250,PS1,3,962.12,963.8,1.68,3.0,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
34250,PS1,3,964.08,965.32,1.24,3.0,I hate plastic waste.
34250,PS1,3,965.32,966.32,1.0,3.0,I absolutely hate it.
34250,PS1,3,966.32,968.24,1.92,3.0,"Yeah, especially with the ocean."
34250,PS1,3,968.24,972.64,4.4,3.0,"When it comes to oceans, I have a lot of ideas for that."
34250,PS1,3,973.72,974.84,1.12,3.0,I have a lot of ideas.
34250,PS1,3,974.84,982.96,8.12,3.0,"So, So bacteria, plastic eating bacteria for those."
34250,PS1,3,983.0,993.2,10.2,3.0,"So you engineer bacteria in a lab, then we release them to the environment, the sea on the environment and they actually eat the plastics."
34250,PS1,3,993.24,996.56,3.32,3.0,"That's actually, they're already working on that."
34250,PS1,3,996.76,998.68,1.92,3.0,They're saying is working on that already.
34250,PS1,3,999.2,1002.56,3.36,3.0,"OK, that can be 1."
34250,PS1,3,1004.32,1010.56,6.24,3.0,"So bacteria that we can release the plastics, but we need to go very creative, but I want to do some creative."
34250,PS1,3,1016.92,1019.0,2.08,1.0,"So mandating, Yeah."
34250,PS1,3,1019.16,1022.28,3.12,1.0,Coming out of a bill that mandates that governor's house.
34250,PS1,3,1022.72,1023.0,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
34250,PS1,3,1023.08,1027.2,4.12,1.0,And their houses can only be made-up of OK.
34250,PS1,3,1027.2,1029.68,2.48,1.0,"So let me, OK, let me structure this."
34250,PS1,3,1029.68,1030.64,0.96,1.0,Let me think on how to put it.
34250,PS1,3,1032.96,1036.16,3.2,3.0,"Yourself became I may have a lot of ideas, but some very creative oh."
34250,PS1,3,1036.16,1036.72,0.56,1.0,"OK, come on."
34250,PS1,3,1036.72,1037.84,1.12,1.0,Just just for.
34250,PS1,3,1038.2,1038.56,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, I'm."
34250,PS1,3,1038.56,1041.88,3.32,3.0,Also here to bump plastics and replace the model with them.
34250,PS1,3,1043.68,1045.36,1.68,3.0,Other materials will be bumble.
34250,PS1,3,1045.36,1050.24,4.88,3.0,"That's not really, Yeah, it's not so the creative or we can build."
34250,PS1,3,1051.68,1052.44,0.76,2.0,A time machine.
34250,PS1,3,1052.72,1053.0,0.28,3.0,Then a time.
34250,PS1,3,1055.56,1056.48,0.92,2.0,Machine go back.
34250,PS1,3,1056.8,1057.68,0.88,1.0,In time and completely.
34250,PS1,3,1058.92,1059.12,0.2,2.0,Remove.
34250,PS1,3,1059.84,1060.28,0.44,1.0,Oh my.
34250,PS1,3,1060.4,1061.68,1.28,2.0,"God, the creation of."
34250,PS1,3,1064.6,1065.48,0.88,3.0,That's so creative.
34250,PS1,3,1065.48,1066.32,0.84,1.0,"You know, I have."
34250,PS1,3,1066.32,1066.56,0.24,1.0,I have.
34250,PS1,3,1066.56,1067.08,0.52,1.0,"OK, let me."
34250,PS1,3,1067.12,1067.64,0.52,1.0,Let me do this.
34250,PS1,3,1068.24,1069.68,1.44,3.0,Just to be feasible as well.
34250,PS1,3,1069.8,1081.08,11.28,1.0,"Right, Passing a bill that mandates that current parliamentary members sitting on the Green committee have their house be built with plastic pollution as long as it exists, like with plastic waste."
34250,PS1,3,1082.96,1084.68,1.72,2.0,You mean that house has to be made?
34250,PS1,3,1084.88,1085.84,0.96,1.0,Out of plastic waste.
34250,PS1,3,1086.32,1086.76,0.44,1.0,Seriously.
34250,PS1,3,1086.76,1090.84,4.08,1.0,"So until they solve the issue, their house will not be cement, there will be plastic waste I."
34250,PS1,3,1091.28,1094.28,3.0,2.0,Mean wouldn't they just come out with a way to use the plastic?
34250,PS1,3,1094.88,1096.28,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, but you reduce plastic pollution."
34250,PS1,3,1096.32,1099.88,3.56,1.0,"But first you see, for house I mean, but it's not a party."
34250,PS1,3,1101.28,1109.12,7.84,3.0,"How, how about we use 3D printing, you know, big 3D printers, you know that we can build houses."
34250,PS1,3,1109.32,1110.88,1.56,3.0,"Those, those would be those."
34250,PS1,3,1112.52,1115.84,3.32,3.0,"It's actually those, those were my ideas when I was being my stuffed up here."
34250,PS1,3,1116.12,1124.16,8.04,3.0,So we collect the the second plastics and then we we turn them into a filament.
34250,PS1,3,1124.48,1126.2,1.72,1.0,"Oh yeah, yeah, we're trying to do the painting."
34250,PS1,3,1126.56,1128.28,1.72,3.0,"Through the print, yes, you know, past it."
34250,PS1,3,1128.4,1129.92,1.52,1.0,Is very small people are doing that.
34250,PS1,3,1129.92,1130.72,0.8,1.0,"It's very good, yeah."
34250,PS1,3,1130.88,1131.4,0.52,3.0,Yes.
34250,PS1,3,1131.76,1131.92,0.16,1.0,Really.
34250,PS1,3,1131.92,1136.08,4.16,1.0,"So like me, The thing is melting the plastic and me casting the plastic is very expensive."
34250,PS1,3,1136.28,1139.56,3.28,1.0,We thought of it before I wanted to do it and and my university is doing it.
34250,PS1,3,1139.68,1140.12,0.44,3.0,Yes.
34250,PS1,3,1140.28,1141.36,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, it was very expensive."
34250,PS1,3,1141.48,1144.92,3.44,1.0,Like the melting and casting is more than if you just take the plastic and throw it.
34250,PS1,3,1146.48,1146.72,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34250,PS1,3,1147.04,1147.64,0.6,3.0,It's OK.
34250,PS1,3,1148.48,1149.52,1.04,1.0,This is hot little thing.
34250,PS1,3,1149.52,1150.36,0.84,1.0,This is harder than.

34250,PS1,3,1160.08,1170.16,10.08,2.0,"Clothes are made out of plastic because so like in the crocheting community, there's such a thing called clan, which is basically plastic yarn, right?"
34250,PS1,3,1170.88,1179.28,8.4,2.0,"And they basically like people do it manually right now where they cut up plastic bags, right, and do long strips and this becomes the yarn and they crochet with it."
34250,PS1,3,1180.36,1182.64,2.28,2.0,So you can we can just replace all.
34250,PS1,3,1182.84,1183.12,0.28,3.0,Clothes.
34250,PS1,3,1183.2,1183.32,0.12,3.0,Yeah.

34250,PS1,3,1200.72,1201.44,0.72,3.0,Uniquely.
34250,PS1,3,1201.44,1202.12,0.68,3.0,"Yeah, maybe."
34250,PS1,3,1202.4,1203.76,1.36,1.0,Like transparent.
34250,PS1,3,1203.84,1205.8,1.96,1.0,I think they will like it.
34250,PS1,3,1208.92,1215.6,6.68,1.0,"I go to farmers, they'll be wearing a completely transparent plastic."
34250,PS1,3,1225.36,1226.16,0.8,1.0,He's also doing right.
34250,PS1,3,1226.16,1228.24,2.08,1.0,Like actually I saw the idea but I don't.
34250,PS1,3,1228.56,1229.68,1.12,1.0,Is there a creative spin to it?
34250,PS1,3,1230.16,1233.8,3.64,3.0,We can use it for clothes and maybe art as well.
34250,PS1,3,1233.96,1235.16,1.2,1.0,For what kind of art?
34250,PS1,3,1235.8,1236.2,0.4,1.0,"Art, Art, art."

34250,PS1,3,1261.36,1269.88,8.52,3.0,"Something creative, We can we can create, build this recycle plastic."
34250,PS1,3,1270.84,1271.4,0.56,1.0,What can you do?
34250,PS1,3,1271.4,1279.04,7.64,1.0,"Plastic, you know, now the what they are doing is they're sending it in containers with our countries."
34250,PS1,3,1279.04,1284.8,5.76,1.0,I kind of want to write that they literally.
34250,PS1,3,1284.8,1285.96,1.16,2.0,It's still plastic.
34250,PS1,3,1286.16,1286.68,0.52,3.0,I can make.
34250,PS1,3,1286.8,1291.72,4.92,1.0,"Actually, it's technically not plastic."
34250,PS1,3,1292.16,1292.96,0.8,3.0,Not the very clear.
34250,PS1,3,1293.0,1294.4,1.4,1.0,"To use, but it's just very fun."
34250,PS1,3,1295.64,1296.6,0.96,1.0,First time to use it.
34250,PS1,3,1300.88,1303.72,2.84,1.0,"Oh my God, it's harder than I thought you'd be."

34250,PS1,3,1329.36,1330.04,0.68,3.0,Better than in the.
34250,PS1,3,1336.2,1337.32,1.12,1.0,Sun in the sun.
34250,PS1,3,1338.2,1338.64,0.44,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34250,PS1,3,1339.84,1341.12,1.28,1.0,It will be too expensive though.
34250,PS1,3,1342.4,1342.6,0.2,1.0,I know.
34250,PS1,3,1342.6,1344.16,1.56,1.0,"OK, let's put them in Chile balloons."

34250,PS1,3,1371.04,1371.84,0.8,1.0,Space pollution.

34293,PS3,3,830.44,835.28,4.84,1.0,And then you don't end up saying it because you read it so so infrequently that you just want to.
34293,PS3,3,835.88,837.12,1.24,2.0,Say exactly like a.

34293,PS3,3,884.28,896.84,12.56,3.0,"So we not focus on the sorry, but focus more increase the immunity by you know drug discovery then it will because the objective is basically reduce its spread, right?"
34293,PS3,3,897.0,899.36,2.36,2.0,Maybe a drug that enhances audacity?

34293,PS3,3,901.76,902.56,0.8,2.0,Just won't like.
34293,PS3,3,902.84,903.44,0.6,3.0,Say sorry.
34293,PS3,3,903.44,903.8,0.36,3.0,Ever.
34293,PS3,3,904.68,909.28,4.6,2.0,"Like, like what kind of person doesn't say sorry even when they're wrong?"
34293,PS3,3,909.32,909.36,0.04,2.0,Oh.
34293,PS3,3,911.32,911.84,0.52,1.0,It's so sad.
34293,PS3,3,912.12,913.0,0.88,2.0,It's sad you like.
34293,PS3,3,913.0,913.32,0.32,1.0,The back.
34293,PS3,3,914.56,916.64,2.08,2.0,But that is like they are going to thrive.
34293,PS3,3,917.68,918.2,0.52,1.0,That's true.
34293,PS3,3,918.64,920.64,2.0,1.0,"So, so just eliminate the work."
34293,PS3,3,920.64,922.28,1.64,1.0,We try to eliminate the emotion.
34293,PS3,3,922.28,924.04,1.76,2.0,"Yeah, like we lose empathy."
34293,PS3,3,925.96,927.12,1.16,1.0,But it's the extreme.
34293,PS3,3,927.76,931.76,4.0,2.0,"I mean, guys, people are dying."
34293,PS3,3,933.12,938.52,5.4,2.0,I think change the world is actually like probably the easiest things to do and like eradicating the world story.
34293,PS3,3,938.84,944.0,5.16,2.0,"Yeah, I feel the words that like people in past generations use, that we just don't use anymore."
34293,PS3,3,945.52,945.68,0.16,1.0,That's.
34293,PS3,3,946.08,952.04,5.96,2.0,"True, it was no longer make saying sorry uncool, but that's really socially unacceptable."
34293,PS3,3,952.08,954.88,2.8,1.0,I think the first one and the second one are pretty.
34293,PS3,3,955.4,956.28,0.88,2.0,I think so too.
34293,PS3,3,956.6,957.08,0.48,2.0,We come you.
34293,PS3,3,957.08,958.52,1.44,1.0,Think we should in a minute.
34293,PS3,3,958.52,960.08,1.56,1.0,What's that sound similar to?
34293,PS3,3,960.08,961.52,1.44,1.0,"Sorry, like story."
34293,PS3,3,962.56,963.28,0.72,2.0,Also we should.
34293,PS3,3,963.32,964.68,1.36,1.0,Replace those words also.
34293,PS3,3,965.4,966.36,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, really close."
34293,PS3,3,967.12,969.6,2.48,1.0,So maybe someone might say wrongly or.
34293,PS3,3,969.6,970.4,0.8,3.0,It's gonna be something.
34293,PS3,3,977.32,978.84,1.52,1.0,"Or maybe you know, it's saying."
34293,PS3,3,978.84,982.68,3.84,1.0,"Sorry, it's not typing or it's not."
34293,PS3,3,982.76,986.08,3.32,2.0,"Yeah, but you know, if you type something over and over again, at some point you'll say it."
34293,PS3,3,986.08,987.72,1.64,2.0,So it's just remove it completely.
34293,PS3,3,988.28,997.16,8.88,1.0,"Yeah, but I mean like maybe for like to reduce the spread, like to be super safe, we can reduce people's content for a while."
34293,PS3,3,997.28,999.0,1.72,1.0,"Actually, no, that's a bit too extreme."
34293,PS3,3,999.24,1000.32,1.08,1.0,Let's stop speaking.
34293,PS3,3,1001.92,1003.4,1.48,2.0,What is like autocorrect?
34293,PS3,3,1003.96,1008.04,4.08,2.0,"You could autocorrect the word sorry to, Jeremy said."
34293,PS3,3,1008.04,1010.84,2.8,2.0,"When you type it like, Oh my gosh, I'm, I'm so sorry."
34293,PS3,3,1011.64,1015.28,3.64,1.0,"Yeah, they censor it from like, you know how when you can't, you can't say violent things on Instagram?"
34293,PS3,3,1015.32,1018.64,3.32,3.0,"Yeah, say say right saying it's more probably if."
34293,PS3,3,1019.16,1019.48,0.32,2.0,I'm sick.
34293,PS3,3,1019.56,1027.12,7.56,2.0,"And so the reason you're auto correcting it is so you know how if you type something over and over again, at some point you probably say it."
34293,PS3,3,1027.12,1032.24,5.12,2.0,"So if if things are censored or all of that, you know that OK, if I'm not, I'll say it on Instagram."
34293,PS3,3,1032.24,1048.4,16.16,2.0,"I probably should say it in real life, Jeremy, but like, I kind of like, for me, a vaccine would be like a perfume or something that or like a pill that'll make people like they'll reduce your empathy, but that's not good, maybe."
34293,PS3,3,1050.72,1051.0,0.28,3.0,Like let.
34293,PS3,3,1051.4,1053.08,1.68,1.0,Me put like examples about sorry.
34293,PS3,3,1059.12,1059.72,0.6,2.0,"OK, OK."
34293,PS3,3,1059.72,1060.12,0.4,2.0,Sorry.
34293,PS3,3,1068.36,1077.08,8.72,3.0,"Yeah, maybe the autocorrect you could put it like, you know, maybe for, you know, don't work."
34293,PS3,3,1077.08,1079.48,2.4,3.0,"Yeah, for the like a machine perhaps."
34293,PS3,3,1083.96,1088.92,4.96,2.0,"What else, really?"
34293,PS3,3,1088.92,1090.88,1.96,2.0,What kind of person doesn't say sorry?
34293,PS3,3,1091.48,1094.84,3.36,2.0,Because I find myself saying sorry even when I don't know anything wrong.
34293,PS3,3,1095.08,1097.56,2.48,2.0,Like I say sorry instead of excuse me sometimes.
34293,PS3,3,1098.64,1100.0,1.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34293,PS3,3,1101.4,1103.8,2.4,2.0,So it's it's not only when you've maybe.
34293,PS3,3,1106.36,1107.76,1.4,1.0,If they don't speak the language.
34293,PS3,3,1114.6,1118.12,3.52,1.0,"Think that, yeah, those countries will try very well, right?"
34293,PS3,3,1118.6,1123.56,4.96,2.0,"They would actually, they would try because it would be unless by sorry me sorry."
34293,PS3,3,1123.56,1147.44,23.88,2.0,"Like universally, like in all languages, they were educate people on the on the problems with the word sorry and how it's bad now."
34293,PS3,3,1149.36,1158.64,9.28,1.0,"I have an idea also, but because if you it went about like we have like a bracelet and then when it's insisted, yeah, saying starting to say to us, Oh my gosh."
34293,PS3,3,1159.52,1160.36,0.84,3.0,"Oh yeah, sure."
34293,PS3,3,1160.6,1161.56,0.96,2.0,Oh my God.
34293,PS3,3,1172.92,1173.04,0.12,3.0,Yes.
34293,PS3,3,1173.68,1174.04,0.36,1.0,You are.
34293,PS3,3,1175.92,1179.8,3.88,1.0,"So if you say like sort, it's really like hit you sort."
34293,PS3,3,1186.64,1192.36,5.72,2.0,"No, no, it will monitor like if it will monitor your."
34293,PS3,3,1192.92,1193.12,0.2,1.0,Heart.
34293,PS3,3,1194.24,1195.4,1.16,2.0,Me your behavior.
34293,PS3,3,1195.76,1198.56,2.8,1.0,"No, I think you should just monitor the vocalization."
34293,PS3,3,1198.68,1199.64,0.96,2.0,OK KKKK.
34293,PS3,3,1199.64,1202.68,3.04,1.0,It had to eliminate you from the human.
34293,PS3,3,1202.72,1206.56,3.84,3.0,"Yeah, I think the human to change your human behavior."
34293,PS3,3,1206.56,1207.72,1.16,3.0,I think it's kind of hard to.
34293,PS3,3,1208.12,1208.48,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
34293,PS3,3,1208.76,1212.2,3.44,1.0,SO maybe you can say SOR then it will hit you.
34293,PS3,3,1212.52,1213.12,0.6,2.0,Shock you hit.
34293,PS3,3,1214.12,1219.0,4.88,3.0,You or perhaps OK?
34293,PS3,3,1220.48,1220.96,0.48,2.0,I like that.
34293,PS3,3,1221.28,1222.56,1.28,2.0,"I like that a lot, yeah."
34293,PS3,3,1222.88,1224.04,1.16,3.0,It's pretty extraordinary.
34293,PS3,3,1224.12,1224.52,0.4,3.0,Very.
34293,PS3,3,1225.12,1227.84,2.72,2.0,"Good, that's very good."
34293,PS3,3,1231.2,1236.0,4.8,2.0,"Unless you're saying sorority, then oops here."
34293,PS3,3,1236.04,1238.16,2.12,2.0,I think we should monitor your behavior.
34293,PS3,3,1238.16,1239.24,1.08,2.0,Vocalization.
34293,PS3,3,1240.52,1241.0,0.48,2.0,"It could, yeah."
34293,PS3,3,1241.92,1242.04,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34293,PS3,3,1243.64,1245.16,1.52,2.0,"You know, I mean collect."
34293,PS3,3,1245.16,1249.4,4.24,2.0,"So if if I run into somebody, I'm obviously not trying to say sorry, trying to say sorry."
34293,PS3,3,1249.64,1256.8,7.16,2.0,"So it's like, you know, when you're trying to say sorry and it will make mistakes, but you know, that's life."
34293,PS3,3,1259.12,1259.48,0.36,3.0,"OK, OK."
34293,PS3,3,1259.48,1260.52,1.04,3.0,"I think next, next."
35126,PS4,3,20.09,23.49,3.4,1.0,I think we have plenty of technology to overcome this.
35126,PS4,3,23.73,25.49,1.76,1.0,So I really.
35126,PS4,3,28.61,29.21,0.6,2.0,See creativeness.
35126,PS4,3,29.49,30.65,1.16,2.0,So what were you?
35126,PS4,3,30.65,31.17,0.52,2.0,What do you think?
35126,PS4,3,31.17,32.96,1.79,2.0,What were you'd say about it?
35126,PS4,3,33.28,34.84,1.56,2.0,Like bringing technology to NO.
35126,PS4,3,35.32,37.56,2.24,1.0,"No, I mean I'm saying we have enough technology."
35126,PS4,3,37.56,42.64,5.08,1.0,So I don't really cannot think of we have created.
35126,PS4,3,42.72,73.16,30.44,2.0,"Yeah, have a rotate where I guess in certain cities you must have like, so like in the UK state schools, if you live in a nicer area, usually the state school, like the public school is very good in that area because everyone's a little bit more wealthy, they'll donate a little bit to the school, blahdy, blahdy, blah."
35126,PS4,3,73.6,79.28,5.68,2.0,"Whereas in rougher areas, the education is worse, even though technically it's also part of the public school system."
35126,PS4,3,79.96,90.84,10.88,2.0,"And often it's like the schools might only be in a place like London, only a few 10 minutes apart, but you could rotate where students go to school every number of months or every once a every year it's almost."
35126,PS4,3,91.4,96.04,4.64,1.0,"Actually, we're doing career, yeah, not once, but we cannot really select it at school."
35126,PS4,3,96.4,98.0,1.6,1.0,It's just rotation so.
35126,PS4,3,98.12,99.0,0.88,2.0,It's that's really smart.
35126,PS4,3,99.0,99.16,0.16,2.0,That's.
35126,PS4,3,99.76,100.92,1.16,1.0,Just your fate.
35126,PS4,3,103.08,109.12,6.04,2.0,"Because yeah, then you almost like the some of the rough kids will get to go to a high school and vice versa, and you're almost like so."
35126,PS4,3,109.72,112.6,2.88,1.0,I went to church school which I'm not believe it.
35126,PS4,3,113.44,114.0,0.56,1.0,It was funny.
35126,PS4,3,115.96,117.48,1.52,2.0,Should we put that as a solution?
35126,PS4,3,118.24,120.12,1.88,2.0,"That's actually pretty interesting, I didn't know who created that."
35126,PS4,3,120.84,127.76,6.92,1.0,"I mean, some very expensive school, like International School, we have to pay, yeah, but otherwise, you know, it's just rotation."
35126,PS4,3,129.04,129.92,0.88,2.0,So you just stick that in.
35126,PS4,3,130.76,131.04,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35126,PS4,3,132.84,141.04,8.2,1.0,Or I could think you get paid once you go to school and finish your like high school or the university or whatever.
35126,PS4,3,142.36,148.84,6.48,3.0,"But I think it's not about the person not wanting to go, it's about not having the access or opportunity."
35126,PS4,3,155.4,163.84,8.44,2.0,"Trace if we rotate, if we assume the resources are unequal between different schools, you just rotate the kids between the resources."
35126,PS4,3,171.48,173.56,2.08,1.0,Or we can have like several ideas there.
35126,PS4,3,174.24,174.72,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
35126,PS4,3,181.52,184.64,3.12,3.0,I'm OK with the rotation idea because I can't think of anything else.
35126,PS4,3,195.2,198.76,3.56,1.0,So can you guys actually choose a school like high school or a school?
35126,PS4,3,198.96,199.2,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35126,PS4,3,199.72,200.0,0.28,1.0,Really.
35126,PS4,3,233.6,234.24,0.64,2.0,Anything else?
35126,PS4,3,235.32,239.84,4.52,1.0,How about people living in very poor country?
35126,PS4,3,239.88,241.92,2.04,1.0,You don't really have access to any school.
35126,PS4,3,242.44,247.4,4.96,2.0,"Yeah, it's a tough one, this one."
35126,PS4,3,251.4,259.96,8.56,1.0,"Or we can pay some teachers from our country to be there, kind of like trembling and education there."
35126,PS4,3,261.4,262.0,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, so many."
35126,PS4,3,262.0,262.32,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35126,PS4,3,262.44,265.12,2.68,2.0,So should we so rotate?
35126,PS4,3,265.12,267.44,2.32,2.0,"I get resources and the teachers, yeah or."
35126,PS4,3,267.8,271.56,3.76,1.0,You can do like #1 #2.
35126,PS4,3,274.24,275.48,1.24,2.0,We have to come up with one.
35126,PS4,3,275.6,277.68,2.08,2.0,"Oh, OK, we have to come up with one."
35126,PS4,3,280.92,287.12,6.2,3.0,You can just like rotate resources and in bracket we just mentioned teachers and schools.
35126,PS4,3,289.56,289.88,0.32,1.0,Etcetera.
35126,PS4,3,293.32,295.16,1.84,1.0,This is much more wrong than therapy.
35126,PS4,3,298.2,302.64,4.44,2.0,"Teachers book, etcetera."
35126,PS4,3,305.4,306.08,0.68,2.0,Did you go with that?
35126,PS4,3,306.08,306.2,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35126,PS4,3,307.4,307.52,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34382,PS1,3,13.4,14.6,1.2,1.0,That's my topic.
34382,PS1,3,19.44,24.08,4.64,1.0,"So refill like buying bulks, bulk ordering?"
34382,PS1,3,31.92,36.08,4.16,2.0,So bulk ordering in terms of what like do you want to like expand it like?
34382,PS1,3,36.08,40.36,4.28,1.0,"Like instead of buying one shampoo like this, you buy like that, OK?"
34382,PS1,3,40.44,41.6,1.16,3.0,"OK, larger quantities."
34382,PS1,3,41.68,48.36,6.68,2.0,"Order larger, yeah, yeah, larger quantities."
34382,PS1,3,50.0,52.04,2.04,3.0,Reduce packaging waste.
34382,PS1,3,56.96,65.24,8.28,3.0,"Another idea is to come up with plastic alternatives, for example bio based plastics which can decompose easily."
34382,PS1,3,65.8,67.04,1.24,1.0,Maybe biodegradable?
34382,PS1,3,67.16,68.92,1.76,3.0,"Yeah, biodegradable versions of."
34382,PS1,3,77.24,79.16,1.92,1.0,"Yeah, we've got an extra G in the large."

34382,PS1,3,105.08,106.36,1.28,2.0,Refill stores.
34382,PS1,3,108.12,111.04,2.92,1.0,Or dispenser station they called in supermarkets.
34382,PS1,3,112.84,113.24,0.4,2.0,Dispensers.
34382,PS1,3,114.16,125.24,11.08,3.0,And promote reuse I mean re reuse of things for it or I mean like you can consume some things like second hand so.
34382,PS1,3,126.08,127.12,1.04,2.0,There will be like a.
34382,PS1,3,127.16,127.84,0.68,3.0,Reproduction.
34382,PS1,3,128.04,130.8,2.76,2.0,Reuse recycle kind of a thing.
34382,PS1,3,130.84,131.6,0.76,2.0,"OK, just reuse."
34382,PS1,3,132.0,132.92,0.92,2.0,Reuse of what?
34382,PS1,3,133.04,133.76,0.72,2.0,Like normal.
34382,PS1,3,134.52,135.8,1.28,1.0,Of second handed stuff.
34382,PS1,3,135.8,136.52,0.72,3.0,"I guess, yeah."
34382,PS1,3,136.52,142.88,6.36,3.0,"For example, you can extend the lifetime of, for example, like we purchase a water bottle and throw it away."
34382,PS1,3,143.16,150.08,6.92,3.0,If you keep using it to store water then it's still in the system like it's not out of the waste.
34382,PS1,3,150.16,152.8,2.64,1.0,Maybe you put extend the larger the tea of the product.
34382,PS1,3,152.8,153.28,0.48,3.0,"Yeah, basically."
34382,PS1,3,153.68,158.32,4.64,1.0,By maybe selling it second hand or yeah.
34382,PS1,3,159.44,160.6,1.16,1.0,Or just use it longer.
34382,PS1,3,160.92,161.28,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
34382,PS1,3,163.24,166.28,3.04,3.0,So increase the time spent from production to waste.
34382,PS1,3,166.28,168.88,2.6,3.0,"Basically, if it's one year now make it 10."
34382,PS1,3,168.88,180.16,11.28,1.0,Years because if we buy something new then it's plastic wrapped but if we buy something from our friends it wouldn't be wrapped in plastic so anything will be alright.
34382,PS1,3,180.8,183.76,2.96,2.0,But even the bottle like the bottle container would be.
34382,PS1,3,183.76,184.88,1.12,1.0,"Plastic, Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34382,PS1,3,185.08,188.08,3.0,1.0,But then you like you should say second hand items out.
34382,PS1,3,193.52,195.2,1.68,2.0,"Or use it for longer, yeah."
34382,PS1,3,201.08,202.6,1.52,3.0,"Finally, we have to choose one idea."
34382,PS1,3,203.2,204.16,0.96,1.0,"No, we don't."
34382,PS1,3,205.04,207.24,2.2,3.0,"Because it's mentioned, please come with one creative."
34382,PS1,3,207.24,207.4,0.16,2.0,Idea.
34382,PS1,3,207.4,208.92,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, last time also I think we did."
34382,PS1,3,209.32,210.68,1.36,1.0,Last time we we did this.
34382,PS1,3,212.64,214.16,1.52,3.0,She said that you have to choose.
34382,PS1,3,214.16,216.24,2.08,3.0,"Come with the fine, OK?"
34382,PS1,3,216.8,217.84,1.04,2.0,I think this is fine.
34382,PS1,3,217.88,218.64,0.76,2.0,4 is OK.
34382,PS1,3,219.76,221.28,1.52,2.0,She'll move on to the next question.
34382,PS1,3,222.76,224.8,2.04,3.0,"OK, we how many questions are there?"
34382,PS1,3,225.4,225.56,0.16,1.0,4
34382,PS1,3,225.56,226.24,0.68,3.0,4 questions.
34382,PS1,3,226.24,227.72,1.48,3.0,"4 questions in 12 minutes, you know."
34382,PS1,3,228.0,229.12,1.12,1.0,"Yeah, no, 12 minutes."
34382,PS1,3,229.36,231.4,2.04,2.0,"Per question, but."
34382,PS1,3,231.4,231.52,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS1,3,231.56,232.08,0.52,3.0,So maybe.
34382,PS1,3,232.28,234.92,2.64,2.0,Not necessarily that you have to use all the 12 minutes.
34382,PS1,3,234.92,235.24,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34382,PS1,3,235.24,235.44,0.2,3.0,But.
34382,PS1,3,235.52,236.44,0.92,2.0,Think of more creative.
34382,PS1,3,237.08,242.72,5.64,3.0,"Ways but we we should maybe think of maybe two or three points at least, because ChatGPT will give so many."
34382,PS1,3,243.0,244.2,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, that is also true."
34382,PS1,3,245.4,246.84,1.44,2.0,But it has to be creative enough.
34382,PS1,3,246.84,248.12,1.28,2.0,"That's what I'm thinking, yeah."
34382,PS1,3,248.16,250.4,2.24,2.0,Like what to do for creativity?
34382,PS1,3,267.93,271.33,3.4,1.0,"Well, that's one, but it's the startup is doing that."
34382,PS1,3,271.33,272.81,1.48,1.0,That's called Plastic Bank.
34382,PS1,3,273.13,280.49,7.36,1.0,So they offer like crypto money to people who pick up the plastic in the ocean.
34382,PS1,3,280.93,290.53,9.6,1.0,"So in why they're using crypto is because if you put the real money to the middleman, then the middleman will cut off like 90% for themselves, 10% to the one who pick it up."
34382,PS1,3,291.0,294.44,3.44,1.0,So then it's like directly passed with the one who pick up the garbage.
34382,PS1,3,294.52,296.48,1.96,2.0,But is it like a plastic?
34382,PS1,3,296.6,298.64,2.04,2.0,Like are we reducing plastic?
34382,PS1,3,298.64,300.44,1.8,1.0,"No, but it said reduce plastic, reduce the."
34382,PS1,3,300.44,300.92,0.48,3.0,Pollution.
34382,PS1,3,301.12,302.44,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, reduce the pollution."
34382,PS1,3,302.8,309.28,6.48,3.0,"So basically incentivize, incentivize monetizing waste collection something?"
34382,PS1,3,309.28,310.48,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
34382,PS1,3,311.12,312.28,1.16,1.0,Recollection maybe?
34382,PS1,3,318.68,327.56,8.88,3.0,Or one way could be to research and come up with new technologies that convert plastic into something.
34382,PS1,3,329.76,340.08,10.32,3.0,"I mean either, I mean like now it's it's it's not non biodegradable and something that."
34382,PS1,3,343.48,345.88,2.4,2.0,But can you convert plastic into like?
34382,PS1,3,345.92,348.28,2.36,2.0,I think you can reuse and recycle it.
34382,PS1,3,349.08,350.12,1.04,2.0,Can you convert it?
34382,PS1,3,352.48,353.16,0.68,2.0,There are different.
34382,PS1,3,353.2,354.72,1.52,1.0,Plastics so very hard.
34382,PS1,3,355.0,356.72,1.72,1.0,"There are different tier of plastics, Yes."
34382,PS1,3,356.72,356.88,0.16,1.0,What?
34382,PS1,3,356.96,357.16,0.2,3.0,Else.
34382,PS1,3,364.92,367.96,3.04,1.0,You can add biodegradable and eatable packaging.
34382,PS1,3,368.52,374.12,5.6,1.0,"Some of the, have you seen the like a water bottle now is being wrapped in a eatable manner."
34382,PS1,3,374.44,377.84,3.4,1.0,"So it's like a water bubble, like how you throw the water and then you just eat it."
34382,PS1,3,378.08,380.52,2.44,1.0,"But it is water, Yeah."
34382,PS1,3,380.56,381.0,0.44,3.0,Water.
34382,PS1,3,381.0,382.56,1.56,3.0,What packaging?
34382,PS1,3,382.8,385.16,2.36,1.0,"Water, yeah, but that package, you can eat it."
34382,PS1,3,385.28,387.2,1.92,1.0,So it's like a membrane kind of thing by.
34382,PS1,3,387.24,390.68,3.44,3.0,"Yeah, so I, I saw one startup I think yesterday only kind of."
34382,PS1,3,390.68,396.0,5.32,3.0,So they are making biodegradable kind of plastic and and it's protein or something.
34382,PS1,3,396.0,397.24,1.24,3.0,They make it from some plants.
34382,PS1,3,397.32,397.56,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS1,3,397.84,399.44,1.6,3.0,And you can eat the packaging itself.
34382,PS1,3,399.88,400.28,0.4,1.0,So very.
34382,PS1,3,400.6,404.56,3.96,3.0,"For example, if it's a candy, you can eat it with the wrapper, Yeah."
34382,PS1,3,404.88,411.76,6.88,3.0,"And for if it's the if it's tea or something, the packet will dissolve in water and it's edible so you don't."
34382,PS1,3,411.76,414.32,2.56,2.0,"That that is OK, but how can you eat?"
34382,PS1,3,415.16,416.56,1.4,2.0,There are edible plastics.
34382,PS1,3,416.64,418.04,1.4,3.0,It's a different kind of plastic.
34382,PS1,3,418.04,419.2,1.16,3.0,It will dissolve in your it's.
34382,PS1,3,419.6,422.84,3.24,1.0,"A new kind of packaging, so maybe you say the biodegradable?"
34382,PS1,3,423.04,429.04,6.0,3.0,"And yeah, but that's in the biodegradable, you can just add."
34382,PS1,3,429.08,431.04,1.96,1.0,Because it's plastic alternatives anyways.
34382,PS1,3,431.4,432.4,1.0,3.0,In the second points.
34382,PS1,3,432.6,432.92,0.32,1.0,Like.
34382,PS1,3,433.2,433.76,0.56,2.0,"Oh, OK."
34382,PS1,3,434.04,435.84,1.8,1.0,Protein or alkali?
34382,PS1,3,438.88,439.72,0.84,1.0,Anything else?
34382,PS1,3,442.68,443.6,0.92,1.0,Become Chinese.
34382,PS1,3,444.4,447.84,3.44,2.0,Oh OK.
34382,PS1,3,450.08,451.32,1.24,2.0,Oh my God.
34382,PS1,3,451.4,455.48,4.08,1.0,"You just place, you see the the one here, you just click it."
34382,PS1,3,455.8,460.04,4.24,3.0,The symbol at the bottom your submitted.
34382,PS1,3,460.72,461.0,0.28,1.0,OK.
34382,PS1,3,462.56,463.2,0.64,2.0,This one.
34382,PS1,3,464.56,466.72,2.16,3.0,"OK, so let's do the next one."
35005,PS4,3,10.2,11.72,1.52,1.0,Bro this was a broad question.
35005,PS4,3,12.24,17.88,5.64,2.0,"I thought it'd be like, like a puzzle with like the other monkey, you know, the like puzzle for the monkeys."
35005,PS4,3,18.48,25.52,7.04,1.0,I like how this is the first line of our recording the monkeys when we get 12 minutes right?
35005,PS4,3,25.52,25.76,0.24,1.0,"True, it's."
35005,PS4,3,26.92,27.44,0.52,3.0,Counting down.
35005,PS4,3,28.32,29.2,0.88,2.0,Educational Inequality.
35005,PS4,3,30.44,31.4,0.96,1.0,Like open.
35005,PS4,3,31.6,32.88,1.28,2.0,Creative idea.
35005,PS4,3,33.4,37.52,4.12,1.0,One other like open resources for academic journals.
35005,PS4,3,37.52,45.92,8.4,2.0,I think we should write down like multiple ideas on the screen just in case you forget and then we brainstorm other ideas and we delete open.
35005,PS4,3,45.96,54.0,8.04,1.0,"Access to academic journals, which is actually what Cambridge University Press is doing because that's stalking them."
35005,PS4,3,54.32,62.84,8.52,1.0,So they're trying to change the mode of access to academic to like the one who are publishing it are actually funding the journal themselves.
35005,PS4,3,62.84,65.24,2.4,1.0,So it it will be Open Access to everyone.
35005,PS4,3,66.04,69.96,3.92,3.0,"Yeah, I only just discovered yesterday how expensive it is to publish Open Access."
35005,PS4,3,70.4,71.0,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35005,PS4,3,71.64,72.4,0.76,3.0,Like 4000.
35005,PS4,3,72.4,74.08,1.68,1.0,USD So they're shifting it.
35005,PS4,3,74.08,76.24,2.16,1.0,They're shifting it to like the publisher.
35005,PS4,3,76.24,77.24,1.0,1.0,I think that's what they're doing.
35005,PS4,3,77.24,79.04,1.8,1.0,They're shifting it to the publisher paying for it.
35005,PS4,3,79.32,80.96,1.64,2.0,But it says created by.
35005,PS4,3,81.16,81.28,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35005,PS4,3,81.36,83.52,2.16,2.0,So we must say something that's really weird.
35005,PS4,3,83.52,83.64,0.12,2.0,We.
35005,PS4,3,83.68,86.48,2.8,3.0,Can do this but through through.
35005,PS4,3,87.52,89.68,2.16,2.0,"No, I think you meant Open Access."
35005,PS4,3,91.32,91.76,0.44,1.0,Oh shit.
35005,PS4,3,92.48,93.4,0.92,1.0,"Oh, can I say that?"
35005,PS4,3,93.44,95.2,1.76,1.0,"Yes, I just swore."
35005,PS4,3,97.4,99.84,2.44,3.0,You need a creative way to enable this.
35005,PS4,3,101.36,102.08,0.72,1.0,Fundings.
35005,PS4,3,102.08,102.6,0.52,1.0,"No, I'm joking."
35005,PS4,3,104.08,110.52,6.44,2.0,"But also because educational inequality stems, it doesn't happen at university."
35005,PS4,3,110.76,112.92,2.16,2.0,"Well, it happens at university level, but as."
35005,PS4,3,113.84,114.32,0.48,1.0,It's more.
35005,PS4,3,114.32,117.72,3.4,2.0,"Rooted in before universities, Yeah, true."
35005,PS4,3,118.52,121.12,2.6,2.0,It happens before people get into universities.
35005,PS4,3,123.96,128.88,4.92,2.0,"And then publishing open at like, Open Access to academic journals doesn't necessarily."
35005,PS4,3,129.04,132.48,3.44,2.0,"Yeah, it doesn't also necessarily promote educational inequality."
35005,PS4,3,132.48,140.4,7.92,2.0,"It just means that people have more access to scientific information, but people who are not in universities, who are not in good universities, are still kept out of them."
35005,PS4,3,140.88,141.0,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35005,PS4,3,141.48,142.28,0.8,1.0,I go with me.
35005,PS4,3,142.6,146.08,3.48,3.0,Computer resources for people who don't actually have access to Internet.
35005,PS4,3,146.56,146.68,0.12,2.0,It's.
35005,PS4,3,146.8,147.4,0.6,3.0,Definitely very.
35005,PS4,3,147.4,147.88,0.48,2.0,Basic.
35005,PS4,3,148.12,150.24,2.12,1.0,I mean it depends on what demographic.
35005,PS4,3,150.36,151.2,0.84,1.0,Like it depends.
35005,PS4,3,151.2,152.8,1.6,1.0,It really depends on the context though it.
35005,PS4,3,153.16,155.84,2.68,3.0,Doesn't say so I think we're free to just.
35005,PS4,3,156.0,156.76,0.76,2.0,Come up with anything.
35005,PS4,3,158.08,165.72,7.64,2.0,So you're saying computer access to electronics and computers at school level for all schools?
35005,PS4,3,166.12,166.56,0.44,3.0,That's.
35005,PS4,3,166.76,170.16,3.4,2.0,"Yeah, I think we can put that in this one and then we can choose the most creative."
35005,PS4,3,171.28,173.88,2.6,2.0,And then there's another program in China where?
35005,PS4,3,176.24,176.56,0.32,3.0,In.
35005,PS4,3,176.72,194.68,17.96,2.0,Like like courses in really good schools in really good cities are by really good teachers are recorded and then they're sent to students in really poor areas with less educational resources so that people can everyone can listen to.
35005,PS4,3,195.0,195.28,0.28,1.0,The like.
35005,PS4,3,195.48,196.32,0.84,2.0,Those lectures.
35005,PS4,3,196.88,200.64,3.76,3.0,So making education beyond just the.
35005,PS4,3,200.84,202.2,1.36,2.0,School setting it's.
35005,PS4,3,202.32,203.48,1.16,3.0,Open to the public at that.
35005,PS4,3,203.48,203.76,0.28,2.0,Point right?
35005,PS4,3,204.64,207.84,3.2,2.0,"No, it's not open to the public, but that's a good idea."
35005,PS4,3,208.24,208.76,0.52,1.0,Buffer.
35005,PS4,3,209.04,216.8,7.76,1.0,"Actually, I think people can use AI to like like mode like a teacher and then you can keep asking them questions and they'll answer you."
35005,PS4,3,216.8,223.68,6.88,1.0,"Like you basically find like a really experienced teacher who like kind of program it or like train their ChatGPT, so-called."
35005,PS4,3,224.0,236.28,12.28,1.0,"And then that can be instilled at every school 'cause like, I think one of the problem with like the unequal distribution of academic resources is that it's very like separated by district."
35005,PS4,3,236.28,244.92,8.64,1.0,Like some district has better school and some has like less worse schools then if they have that like sort of like a teacher model.
35005,PS4,3,245.0,245.2,0.2,2.0,Like.
35005,PS4,3,245.88,256.88,11.0,1.0,"In their AI program, they can just ask question whenever and it will be someone who's like very expert and you can keep training it up and keep talking to the AI until it responds very like accurately, if that makes sense."
35005,PS4,3,257.36,258.68,1.32,3.0,"Robotic teachers, yeah."
35005,PS4,3,259.88,260.6,0.72,2.0,Let's go.
35005,PS4,3,260.6,263.0,2.4,1.0,Robotic teachers on ChatGPT.
35005,PS4,3,266.8,267.68,0.88,1.0,But you're also similar.
35005,PS4,3,267.68,269.28,1.6,1.0,"You're also like, what was that AI?"
35005,PS4,3,270.08,274.32,4.24,2.0,"No, my words just record recruit."
35005,PS4,3,274.32,275.48,1.16,1.0,Lectures online.
35005,PS4,3,278.48,288.44,9.96,2.0,Record lectures from really good teachers and then distribute them or distribute them to all schools.
35005,PS4,3,294.84,295.76,0.92,1.0,"OK, So what should we pay?"
35005,PS4,3,296.56,297.92,1.36,1.0,"I mean, we'll still 5 minutes."
35005,PS4,3,298.2,299.72,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, true."
35005,PS4,3,300.4,301.68,1.28,3.0,It's hard to say like what is.
35005,PS4,3,301.8,304.0,2.2,3.0,"What they consider creative though, is."
35005,PS4,3,305.0,306.52,1.52,1.0,Add an emoji on this does.
35005,PS4,3,307.08,310.96,3.88,3.0,"It need to be practical because if it doesn't need to be practical, we can go crazy."
35005,PS4,3,311.8,313.6,1.8,2.0,I think it needs to be practical.
35005,PS4,3,314.24,316.6,2.36,1.0,"I mean, we're quite practical right now, local life."
35005,PS4,3,316.8,318.24,1.44,3.0,"Yeah, we are very practical."
35005,PS4,3,328.2,337.28,9.08,2.0,"Well, like, you know, like in the US they have different admissions criteria for people from different areas."
35005,PS4,3,338.04,351.72,13.68,2.0,"So they have that in a lot of countries, lower admissions criteria for marginalized and disadvantaged groups and also funding schemes for them."
35005,PS4,3,352.96,353.92,0.96,2.0,But I guess this is.
35005,PS4,3,354.28,354.92,0.64,1.0,Quite practical.
35005,PS4,3,354.92,356.0,1.08,2.0,Very standard.
35005,PS4,3,356.0,357.28,1.28,2.0,It's not very creative.
35005,PS4,3,362.6,373.4,10.8,2.0,"If we can go like really, really creative, we can design like neural devices when your operations and make everyone smart."
35005,PS4,3,374.96,375.28,0.32,1.0,OK.
35005,PS4,3,377.84,380.4,2.56,2.0,"Or to make everyone dumb, it's still equal."
35005,PS4,3,382.08,382.84,0.76,1.0,True.
35005,PS4,3,383.84,385.8,1.96,1.0,Or oh it's counting down I didn't know.
35005,PS4,3,385.8,386.84,1.04,1.0,"OK, sorry."
35005,PS4,3,388.28,394.44,6.16,1.0,I thought it was counting up what could practical.
35005,PS4,3,396.88,401.72,4.84,2.0,Or like some kind of technology that can?
35005,PS4,3,410.24,413.56,3.32,1.0,Use music to teach them to rest the words.
35005,PS4,3,414.24,418.24,4.0,2.0,What can test for learning abilities?
35005,PS4,3,421.36,423.04,1.68,1.0,But how does that equal look?
35005,PS4,3,423.44,431.28,7.84,2.0,And use them as admissions criteria as like school and university levels rather than.
35005,PS4,3,432.0,433.04,1.04,2.0,I guess that doesn't really solve.
35005,PS4,3,433.04,433.56,0.52,1.0,The problem?
35005,PS4,3,433.64,435.04,1.4,2.0,Of academic resources.
35005,PS4,3,436.04,446.44,10.4,1.0,Using music to teach so they will remember every word even if they're not used to like memorizing stuff.
35005,PS4,3,448.04,450.52,2.48,1.0,Just like spread the song nationwide.
35005,PS4,3,452.2,452.44,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35005,PS4,3,452.44,458.72,6.28,1.0,"That's like complete like out of the radar sort of solution, I mean."
35005,PS4,3,460.92,462.64,1.72,3.0,I like the robotic teacher's idea.
35005,PS4,3,462.92,463.52,0.6,3.0,I love all of these.
35005,PS4,3,463.76,464.2,0.44,3.0,I think it's.
35005,PS4,3,464.96,465.88,0.92,2.0,Let's just do that.
35005,PS4,3,465.96,467.0,1.04,1.0,The robotic teacher.
35005,PS4,3,467.0,474.2,7.2,1.0,"OK, oh, they're oh, wait, OK, robotic teachers on ChatGPT."
35005,PS4,3,474.24,482.48,8.24,3.0,"Actually, you don't even need to delete those 'cause we can like robotic teachers on ChatGPT that can have access to all the academic journals."
35005,PS4,3,483.52,485.4,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, like using no."
35005,PS4,3,485.44,487.16,1.72,2.0,"I think it has to be 1 idea, yeah."
35005,PS4,3,487.4,499.96,12.56,3.0,"I'm just saying the robotic teachers have access to all journals, so it kind of incorporates the idea of everyone being able to access the same results."
35005,PS4,3,500.04,502.04,2.0,2.0,Just through this robotic.
35005,PS4,3,502.04,502.48,0.44,3.0,Teacher.
35005,PS4,3,503.4,504.64,1.24,1.0,Then place one.
35005,PS4,3,505.04,509.08,4.04,1.0,Then place a few online a place.
35005,PS4,3,509.08,519.88,10.8,1.0,Then place a few online robotic teachers at regions with less academic resources and like this.
35005,PS4,3,520.76,523.44,2.68,2.0,What is place a few online robotic teachers?
35005,PS4,3,524.0,525.12,1.12,2.0,"No, it's place like."
35005,PS4,3,525.76,526.56,0.8,1.0,Implement.
35005,PS4,3,527.32,530.48,3.16,2.0,It should be assigned A robotic teacher for every.
35005,PS4,3,530.52,532.8,2.28,1.0,Student OK for every student.
35005,PS4,3,532.8,533.8,1.0,3.0,That's great and.
35005,PS4,3,534.2,541.16,6.96,1.0,Assigned Let's do it an online robotic teacher access for every.
35005,PS4,3,541.16,544.36,3.2,2.0,Student areas where they don't have Internet.
35005,PS4,3,546.8,549.24,2.44,3.0,Because robotic teachers that come with their own.
35005,PS4,3,549.56,550.04,0.48,1.0,It can be.
35005,PS4,3,550.12,550.68,0.56,3.0,Offline.
35005,PS4,3,551.56,553.52,1.96,2.0,"Yeah, I think you just delete online."
35005,PS4,3,554.04,555.36,1.32,1.0,"OK, it can be offline I."
35005,PS4,3,555.4,556.68,1.28,2.0,"Think it's already been trained, Yeah."
35005,PS4,3,558.04,561.04,3.0,2.0,And we don't have to consider the practicalities of technology.
35005,PS4,3,564.88,568.76,3.88,2.0,"What I think maybe not just ask questions, but also."
35005,PS4,3,569.36,569.72,0.36,3.0,They can they.
35005,PS4,3,569.76,570.12,0.36,1.0,Teach.
35005,PS4,3,570.12,571.0,0.88,2.0,Actively.
35005,PS4,3,571.04,571.32,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35005,PS4,3,571.8,575.32,3.52,2.0,"Actively because if you are not a good student, you don't know what."
35005,PS4,3,575.32,575.8,0.48,1.0,Questions.
35005,PS4,3,575.84,577.84,2.0,1.0,They want to play lectures.
35005,PS4,3,579.12,581.4,2.28,2.0,And design curriculums.
35005,PS4,3,583.2,585.36,2.16,1.0,That's quite ambitious curriculum.
35005,PS4,3,587.36,588.16,0.8,1.0,So how do you spell it?
35005,PS4,3,588.16,588.52,0.36,1.0,"No, I."
35005,PS4,3,588.88,592.56,3.68,2.0,Think it's like and we can actually assess the students.
35005,PS4,3,592.56,593.0,0.44,1.0,Lush.
35005,PS4,3,593.0,594.48,1.48,1.0,I'm not sure I think spy.
35005,PS4,3,594.6,597.56,2.96,3.0,Basically a robotic teacher that can do everything.
35005,PS4,3,597.64,602.72,5.08,2.0,But do it well because a lot of agents don't have a lot of the teachers.
35005,PS4,3,603.44,604.08,0.64,1.0,Question.
35005,PS4,3,605.04,606.0,0.96,1.0,What access what?
35005,PS4,3,606.0,606.44,0.44,1.0,What do you say?
35005,PS4,3,606.44,607.28,0.84,2.0,Assess.
35005,PS4,3,607.68,608.52,0.84,1.0,O Assess.
35005,PS4,3,609.2,609.96,0.76,1.0,Assess.
35005,PS4,3,610.36,616.04,5.68,2.0,Students level and areas of incomplete and some of it really.
35005,PS4,3,616.2,616.32,0.12,3.0,Good.
35005,PS4,3,618.84,627.0,8.16,2.0,I think you can delete on chat BT because it doesn't have to be on chat BT and then we can delete everything else.
35005,PS4,3,628.16,628.28,0.12,1.0,OK.
35005,PS4,3,628.44,628.88,0.44,1.0,Sounds good.
35005,PS4,3,630.08,630.8,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, great."
34391,PS4,6,0.0,486.0,12.24,3.0,Educational Inequality Educational inequality is the an equal distribution of academic resources to disadvantaged and marginalized groups.
34391,PS4,6,487.52,491.16,3.64,3.0,Let's come up with one creative idea to overcome inequality in education.
34391,PS4,6,494.08,494.76,0.68,4.0,So many.
34391,PS4,6,494.96,497.32,2.36,1.0,I've been thinking about this for for a long.
34391,PS4,6,497.52,503.84,6.32,2.0,Time increasing government support like through funding SO and making it accessible to everyone.
34391,PS4,6,503.88,505.76,1.88,3.0,"Is at least including government, which?"
34391,PS4,6,505.84,510.0,4.16,2.0,"Which they are already trying to do, but maybe like making more efforts, more funding."
34391,PS4,6,510.36,511.68,1.32,3.0,"More funding from government, Yeah."
34391,PS4,6,511.68,514.76,3.08,3.0,"I mean, it's it's it's needed, definitely."
34391,PS4,6,515.12,515.96,0.84,3.0,What do you have in mind?
34391,PS4,6,517.24,519.28,2.04,1.0,Previously I thought about two ideas.
34391,PS4,6,519.28,524.88,5.6,1.0,One is the online courses recorded by the great universities around the world.
34391,PS4,6,525.4,529.88,4.48,1.0,"So because the Internet is very cheap, affordable."
34391,PS4,6,530.28,534.12,3.84,1.0,And the another one is like LLM tool.
34391,PS4,6,534.56,557.92,23.36,1.0,"It's just large, large language model just to incorporate all of the ideas, great articles from advanced universities and to make it a tool to answer the questions of the like the disadvantaged students ask just and as a monthly subscription, it will be very cheap as well."
34391,PS4,6,557.92,565.32,7.4,1.0,But the more people and more users can be viewed because I was thinking about this for a long time.
34391,PS4,6,566.48,578.08,11.6,2.0,"Yeah, so like basically what Khan Academy is doing and like or maybe collating a lot of stuff and then using AI to to instruct the course content and also."
34391,PS4,6,578.52,579.44,0.92,1.0,Just like interact.
34391,PS4,6,579.44,579.68,0.24,2.0,With the.
34391,PS4,6,580.28,580.6,0.32,6.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,581.08,583.92,2.84,1.0,Just like a tragedy in education field.
34391,PS4,6,585.56,589.56,4.0,5.0,Talks about specifically disadvantaged and marginalized groups.
34391,PS4,6,589.6,589.84,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,589.84,602.92,13.08,2.0,"So I think like basically using low cost technology like Internet which is which can be easily accessible, but this platform also should either be subsidized or free."
34391,PS4,6,603.92,604.92,1.0,3.0,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
34391,PS4,6,605.32,611.48,6.16,1.0,"It cost less, much less than you, you being here to receive the education."
34391,PS4,6,612.32,613.0,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, definitely."
34391,PS4,6,614.48,627.12,12.64,6.0,"Are we thinking about a an equality equation in one school or between a school, for example, and school for different countries different regions, or between or between a school different students?"
34391,PS4,6,627.4,628.16,0.76,2.0,I think between.
34391,PS4,6,628.96,629.68,0.72,5.0,Regions like.
34391,PS4,6,630.12,634.68,4.56,2.0,"Regions of marginalized communities, they cannot maybe economically or."
34391,PS4,6,634.68,638.24,3.56,3.0,People might not have the resources to get up from other education.
34391,PS4,6,638.4,638.52,0.12,5.0,OK.
34391,PS4,6,638.52,640.2,1.68,5.0,And it could be based on gender.
34391,PS4,6,641.72,643.88,2.16,2.0,Or remote living in remote areas.
34391,PS4,6,643.88,644.76,0.88,4.0,Disability or.
34391,PS4,6,645.32,647.4,2.08,2.0,"Very, very poor communities."
34391,PS4,6,649.6,651.28,1.68,3.0,Let's try to be more.
34391,PS4,6,651.48,651.96,0.48,6.0,Creative.
34391,PS4,6,652.08,652.6,0.52,1.0,Creative.
34391,PS4,6,655.4,656.84,1.44,3.0,So maybe.
34391,PS4,6,662.4,675.88,13.48,6.0,"Maybe obligatory exchange programs, forcing people to go to a school to discover the situation knowledge, what is the condition on which people live in to understand be in their shoes."
34391,PS4,6,676.88,684.32,7.44,6.0,"So I think unfortunately there is not enough resource to give funding to all these schools, to all the education be the same."
34391,PS4,6,684.72,694.0,9.28,6.0,"But I think we can treat people empathy to avoid marginalized others to other students because of their education level, right?"
34391,PS4,6,694.0,698.6,4.6,6.0,"If you understand the situation of the other, you can treat treat them better."
34391,PS4,6,700.12,700.28,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,701.0,703.16,2.16,4.0,Just rather did they say one creative idea.
34391,PS4,6,703.28,705.12,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, no, that's what I was asking her."
34391,PS4,6,705.12,705.6,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, we can."
34391,PS4,6,705.88,706.16,0.28,2.0,We can.
34391,PS4,6,706.56,707.52,0.96,3.0,Suggest 11.
34391,PS4,6,711.36,712.44,1.08,6.0,"Creative idea, so yeah, but this is."
34391,PS4,6,712.44,712.92,0.48,2.0,This is cruel.
34391,PS4,6,712.92,713.8,0.88,2.0,That's what I asked.
34391,PS4,6,713.96,715.2,1.24,2.0,We can write multiple ideas.
34391,PS4,6,715.2,715.96,0.76,4.0,This is This is.
34391,PS4,6,716.4,724.68,8.28,3.0,"Creative So you know how governments, some governments require people to do mandatory one year military."
34391,PS4,6,725.16,725.52,0.36,4.0,Service.
34391,PS4,6,726.0,729.56,3.56,3.0,You can do mandatory one year educational service service.
34391,PS4,6,731.12,732.12,1.0,1.0,In rural area.
34391,PS4,6,732.28,735.04,2.76,3.0,"Exactly, exactly a good one."
34391,PS4,6,735.04,736.08,1.04,3.0,Force people to do that.
34391,PS4,6,737.16,739.76,2.6,2.0,And for which people like who will be those So the.
34391,PS4,6,740.12,741.32,1.2,3.0,"University students, right?"
34391,PS4,6,741.36,744.96,3.6,3.0,"And you graduate from, I don't know, and degree in economics."
34391,PS4,6,745.0,750.44,5.44,3.0,"You go and teach, I don't know economy, maybe I don't know basic maths."
34391,PS4,6,751.16,751.44,0.28,6.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,751.84,754.24,2.4,3.0,"Force people to do that like in the military, right?"
34391,PS4,6,755.36,755.88,0.52,4.0,That's great.
34391,PS4,6,756.56,762.56,6.0,2.0,"Yeah, or even if not everyone, at least you can force the students who give you who you give scholarship."
34391,PS4,6,762.6,763.08,0.48,6.0,Or something.
34391,PS4,6,763.32,765.92,2.6,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, to be able to give back."
34391,PS4,6,767.68,794.8,27.12,1.0,"Or also we can or the university can make a pair of current student and with a student from it's an advantage to background so that make they make friends and they catch up regularly during the, I don't know, maybe four years of the undergraduate to help the student in the rural place to grow to see the bigger, bigger world like a like."
34391,PS4,6,794.8,795.64,0.84,4.0,A buddy program.
34391,PS4,6,795.68,796.72,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, buddy program."
34391,PS4,6,798.04,799.0,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, I like that."
34391,PS4,6,799.0,801.48,2.48,3.0,"Like having like a a peer program, right?"
34391,PS4,6,801.88,809.4,7.52,3.0,"Or you have someone from maybe a much more advanced program teaching you things they are, you know, learning."
34391,PS4,6,810.96,813.44,2.48,3.0,"Also you could again creative, right?"
34391,PS4,6,814.12,814.44,0.32,1.0,Creative.
34391,PS4,6,814.64,814.8,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,815.12,825.8,10.68,4.0,Could also be like universities that are admitting students the governments can give them a coda of like the class should be consists of like 10% of this community.
34391,PS4,6,826.08,826.28,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,827.12,829.52,2.4,4.0,And then the universities would have to admit these students.
34391,PS4,6,830.4,830.76,0.36,3.0,Force.
34391,PS4,6,832.52,832.88,0.36,4.0,Diversity.
34391,PS4,6,833.2,833.64,0.44,4.0,Yeah.
34391,PS4,6,834.56,835.4,0.84,4.0,Coda System.
34391,PS4,6,837.08,843.84,6.76,3.0,Also a creative idea could be those parents that doesn't send their kids to to school in early.
34391,PS4,6,844.28,844.88,0.6,4.0,Years.
34391,PS4,6,844.88,849.52,4.64,3.0,"And maybe they have them, you know, like working, working or or not going to school."
34391,PS4,6,849.92,850.6,0.68,3.0,Send them to jail.
34391,PS4,6,851.36,852.4,1.04,4.0,This actually happens.
34391,PS4,6,852.4,854.0,1.6,1.0,"Yeah, it's like, it's like mandatory."
34391,PS4,6,854.0,857.0,3.0,2.0,"I mean, it's already happening in some places like you."
34391,PS4,6,857.12,859.84,2.72,2.0,You can deny them government benefits or some kind of no.
34391,PS4,6,862.44,862.68,0.24,4.0,I think.
34391,PS4,6,862.68,863.04,0.36,4.0,I think.
34391,PS4,6,863.36,863.48,0.12,6.0,That.
34391,PS4,6,864.64,870.8,6.16,4.0,"Happens like in the in some countries, like you have to it's compulsory to high school, like you have to go."
34391,PS4,6,872.76,872.84,0.08,6.0,You.
34391,PS4,6,873.92,875.72,1.8,5.0,Just introduce like 1 standard.
34391,PS4,6,876.0,880.44,4.44,5.0,It talks about unequal distribution of academic resources like have a central authority.
34391,PS4,6,880.88,883.56,2.68,5.0,Usually what happens is there are multiple authorities in a country.
34391,PS4,6,883.56,886.64,3.08,5.0,Everybody has different academic standards so enforce 1.
34391,PS4,6,886.92,892.08,5.16,5.0,So there is no scope of disadvantage is at least an academic resource.
34391,PS4,6,892.6,893.08,0.48,5.0,What?
34391,PS4,6,893.32,902.24,8.92,5.0,The only difference then would be access to information through Internet or LLMS but at least the base education like set of fixed standard primary education syllabus.
34391,PS4,6,903.4,904.4,1.0,5.0,"Yeah, at least in India."
34391,PS4,6,904.48,905.36,0.88,3.0,"Early years, right?"
34391,PS4,6,905.36,910.32,4.96,5.0,At least till you have the basic reading and comprehension skills.
34391,PS4,6,910.32,912.8,2.48,5.0,"Basic math, so."
34391,PS4,6,913.72,924.6,10.88,1.0,They can also shifted the teachers from the good students to the to to the poor regions for like one or two years like the teachers can take.
34391,PS4,6,924.72,926.12,1.4,3.0,Like a mandatory again like.
34391,PS4,6,926.12,929.88,3.76,1.0,"Yeah, like a mandatory policy, that teacher is also."
34391,PS4,6,929.92,930.0,0.08,3.0,I.
34391,PS4,6,930.4,930.72,0.32,1.0,Like that?
34391,PS4,6,930.76,931.36,0.6,1.0,Educational.
34391,PS4,6,933.0,933.12,0.12,1.0,Yes.
34391,PS4,6,933.68,938.24,4.56,4.0,Especially people in the in the armed forces are they just have to move to places.
34391,PS4,6,938.76,946.84,8.08,3.0,"Even you can use, for example, in Ecuador you have if you are studying medicine, you have to do one year of you know medicine in a rural province."
34391,PS4,6,949.28,953.36,4.08,2.0,"And it's also there in India and not in all colleges, but."
34391,PS4,6,956.64,957.16,0.52,3.0,We call it.
34391,PS4,6,958.24,962.28,4.04,6.0,Like that's.
34391,PS4,6,963.36,974.48,11.12,4.0,"It and just to put 2 points, penalize parents if they don't send and coda system for universities to admit students don't send."
34391,PS4,6,976.64,977.04,0.4,1.0,You're welcome.
34391,PS4,6,982.24,988.48,6.24,4.0,It's the Coda system for universities to admit marginalized or disadvantaged groups.
34391,PS4,6,991.08,991.8,0.72,4.0,They should be.
34391,PS4,6,994.88,998.24,3.36,3.0,"Nice, that way we can send a lot of people to jail."
34391,PS4,6,1000.56,1002.64,2.08,4.0,You're you're too excited about this idea.
34391,PS4,6,1002.64,1002.8,0.16,4.0,What?
34391,PS4,6,1004.48,1004.72,0.24,6.0,Happened.
34391,PS4,6,1006.32,1007.04,0.72,3.0,I'm happy this is.
35278,PS4,3,1.16,1.6,0.44,1.0,Oh God.
35278,PS4,3,1.84,11.96,10.12,1.0,"OK, one creative idea to overcome inequality in education immediately."
35278,PS4,3,11.96,15.48,3.52,1.0,I'm thinking informative billboards around the town.
35278,PS4,3,16.8,25.64,8.84,2.0,I'm thinking about equality versus equity because I don't think equality is the right word there.
35278,PS4,3,25.64,28.56,2.92,2.0,I think we should be promoting equity.
35278,PS4,3,29.88,31.32,1.44,2.0,"This is a very basic idea, but."
35278,PS4,3,34.68,38.36,3.68,1.0,"OK, but if this is how they're describing it."
35278,PS4,3,40.04,50.52,10.48,2.0,"Good diagnosis for the needs and good knowledge of marginalised groups and their needs, but you need to know where the disadvantage lies in order to be able to target it."
35278,PS4,3,57.92,58.96,1.04,1.0,Semi creator though.
35278,PS4,3,58.96,61.2,2.24,1.0,I'm thinking like on the back of cigarette packets.
35278,PS4,3,61.2,64.32,3.12,1.0,They like do basic maths and algebra to everyone.
35278,PS4,3,64.32,65.4,1.08,2.0,Get education though.
35278,PS4,3,66.2,74.48,8.28,1.0,"Yeah, but that means then everyone regardless of their educational status will be force fed these educational topics to enhance them."
35278,PS4,3,74.48,75.64,1.16,1.0,More fun facts everywhere.
35278,PS4,3,75.64,79.0,3.36,1.0,Penguin are already doing it with their rappers and having fun facts and jokes.
35278,PS4,3,79.68,81.96,2.28,3.0,But would they count as academic resources?
35278,PS4,3,82.84,85.52,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, if you if you do a fun fact if you do basic algebra."
35278,PS4,3,87.04,89.8,2.76,2.0,I do think it's more about like what can you do in school?
35278,PS4,3,92.0,98.64,6.64,2.0,There's also Did the number of cigarette smokers decrease when they started to put in images on the packages?
35278,PS4,3,98.92,104.16,5.24,1.0,"Well, yeah, but there's a difference between gum disease and simple algebra."
35278,PS4,3,105.08,107.96,2.88,2.0,But a lot of simple algebra will not be understood by people.
35278,PS4,3,108.8,109.4,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35278,PS4,3,109.4,114.92,5.52,1.0,So you get them to understand it through promoting it on billboards or other people sit.
35278,PS4,3,115.32,120.4,5.08,2.0,Motivation to look for afterwards instead of just be like yeah numbers whatever or letters.
35278,PS4,3,120.6,125.56,4.96,1.0,"Yeah, but it still contributes to it because within the school we're already."
35278,PS4,3,125.56,129.16,3.6,2.0,"Assuming come in a quality education not to contribute though, right?"
35278,PS4,3,129.68,139.84,10.16,1.0,"No, but that does overcome it because then people that don't necessarily have access to these academic resources would receive them kind of by proxy and subliminally through a billboard or through advertising means."
35278,PS4,3,139.84,139.96,0.12,1.0,But.
35278,PS4,3,140.04,141.4,1.36,2.0,Doesn't mean I don't understand it.
35278,PS4,3,142.08,146.24,4.16,1.0,"Yes, so you can do it at various levels of difficulty."
35278,PS4,3,146.24,146.92,0.68,2.0,It's your call.
35278,PS4,3,146.92,149.56,2.64,2.0,I don't think that's going to help the problem we've got.
35278,PS4,3,149.64,152.96,3.32,2.0,"But if you agree with that, I don't know what your your opinion is."
35278,PS4,3,153.8,157.0,3.2,3.0,I think it wouldn't count as academic resources.
35278,PS4,3,157.44,159.48,2.04,1.0,"OK, Yeah, I."
35278,PS4,3,159.48,159.96,0.48,2.0,Get the idea?
35278,PS4,3,159.96,164.04,4.08,2.0,I think what I understand where you're coming from is like this will therefore mean it's everywhere.
35278,PS4,3,164.04,168.96,4.92,2.0,"So what you're looking at, you'll be being able to practice and you're being able to get the actual information."
35278,PS4,3,169.28,174.6,5.32,2.0,But I don't think it's a resource that will overcome like an inequality.
35278,PS4,3,174.6,181.88,7.28,2.0,"If you define inequality, being able, for example, like one of the biggest things in education is socio economic background, which basically."
35278,PS4,3,181.88,194.72,12.84,2.0,"So if your mum and dad don't value education at all, don't care about it, or you know, you don't have a good breakfast in the morning because mum comes from a late night shift, yeah, you are much more likely to do worse than school."
35278,PS4,3,195.0,195.32,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,195.56,199.4,3.84,2.0,So how does your cigarette packet being hit really critical here?
35278,PS4,3,199.4,199.72,0.32,2.0,"No, no."
35278,PS4,3,199.72,201.08,1.36,1.0,"No, it's good, but it's not a good point."
35278,PS4,3,201.2,201.92,0.72,2.0,That child?
35278,PS4,3,202.32,204.32,2.0,1.0,Because they're being subliminally fed.
35278,PS4,3,204.32,206.28,1.96,2.0,But they don't care about those numbers and letters.
35278,PS4,3,206.28,207.64,1.36,1.0,But they're being subliminally fed them.
35278,PS4,3,207.96,210.24,2.28,2.0,"They're not, because they're just being given a + b = C."
35278,PS4,3,210.6,211.24,0.64,1.0,"But yeah, exactly."
35278,PS4,3,211.24,212.96,1.72,1.0,Which is the foundation of education?
35278,PS4,3,212.96,213.84,0.88,2.0,There's no meaning to it.
35278,PS4,3,214.16,216.48,2.32,1.0,"Not necessarily, because that's the foundation of education."
35278,PS4,3,216.76,218.48,1.72,2.0,But that child doesn't care about education.
35278,PS4,3,219.28,227.84,8.56,1.0,"But they're still being fed the opportunity to have it, as opposed to say, if their parents can't afford to put them in a school, but actually they're interested in learning about these topics."
35278,PS4,3,228.0,231.28,3.28,1.0,"Yes, Now they have access to it because there's a big billboard around the city."
35278,PS4,3,231.48,232.52,1.04,1.0,There's advertisements.
35278,PS4,3,232.64,233.6,0.96,1.0,You're sitting on a train.
35278,PS4,3,233.6,234.24,0.64,1.0,You're seeing.
35278,PS4,3,234.44,235.04,0.6,1.0,"OK, here's some."
35278,PS4,3,235.04,237.36,2.32,2.0,Basic algebra advertising showing them this.
35278,PS4,3,237.64,238.56,0.92,2.0,It's going to teach them.
35278,PS4,3,239.12,241.4,2.28,1.0,"Basic algebra, basic English, basic history."
35278,PS4,3,241.48,243.0,1.52,1.0,You do on adverts around the tube.
35278,PS4,3,243.2,246.68,3.48,1.0,"These kids are going to be looking at it all day and they're like, oh shit, I wish I was going to a better school."
35278,PS4,3,246.72,250.92,4.2,1.0,"But unfortunately my parents, because they don't value my education, can afford to put me in a better school."
35278,PS4,3,251.08,255.4,4.32,1.0,"So now that I actually have this understanding and I'm seeing these basic concepts, I'm building up an interest."
35278,PS4,3,255.56,259.56,4.0,1.0,"OK, now I can go out and research these things on my own because I've been fed these subliminally."
35278,PS4,3,259.92,260.64,0.72,2.0,I get what you mean.
35278,PS4,3,260.72,261.8,1.08,2.0,I work in a secondary school.
35278,PS4,3,261.8,264.32,2.52,2.0,That's not going to happen with 90% of kids.
35278,PS4,3,264.56,266.0,1.44,2.0,They don't have that motivation.
35278,PS4,3,266.0,267.04,1.04,2.0,They're not going to look at it.
35278,PS4,3,267.4,269.84,2.44,2.0,"They're going to be like, yeah, that's maths, I can't do maths, that's too."
35278,PS4,3,269.84,274.6,4.76,1.0,"Difficult for me, but fundamentally, would that help overcome that inequality for those kids that are interested?"
35278,PS4,3,275.88,277.96,2.08,2.0,"In my opinion, as a trained teacher, no."
35278,PS4,3,278.4,279.08,0.68,1.0,"OK, So what?"
35278,PS4,3,279.52,281.4,1.88,2.0,"Would help, but I understand where the idea is from."
35278,PS4,3,281.4,287.16,5.76,2.0,I think it could help those that are super motivated that have an idea of what some of those things can already mean.
35278,PS4,3,287.16,294.0,6.84,2.0,"Like they need to kind of know that algebra is a thing before they can look at a billboard and be like, I can apply this, this is what we learnt in school."
35278,PS4,3,294.0,300.12,6.12,1.0,"Yeah, but then So what if they're, what if they're attaching it to say, like a packet of Haribos, you know, suites that they're interested in?"
35278,PS4,3,300.2,300.52,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,300.56,302.28,1.72,1.0,"And they're like, OK, shit, I like this."
35278,PS4,3,302.32,303.36,1.04,1.0,I'm reading the packet.
35278,PS4,3,303.36,304.12,0.76,1.0,"OK, this is cool."
35278,PS4,3,304.24,308.48,4.24,2.0,"Yeah, no, I think that's probably a, you know, a better idea."
35278,PS4,3,308.48,311.72,3.24,2.0,I just don't still don't think it's going to overcome an inequality.
35278,PS4,3,311.76,313.32,1.56,1.0,"OK, so let's talk about another idea."
35278,PS4,3,313.68,314.72,1.04,1.0,Let's talk about another idea.
35278,PS4,3,314.72,315.68,0.96,1.0,Then what's another idea?
35278,PS4,3,315.76,316.48,0.72,1.0,What's another idea do?
35278,PS4,3,317.64,317.72,0.08,2.0,You.
35278,PS4,3,318.6,319.04,0.44,3.0,Have any ideas?
35278,PS4,3,319.04,338.36,19.32,3.0,How about strict government regulations on at least half of the cartoons that are catered towards the younger people being educationally or academically informative 'cause I think these marginal the marginalised groups usually spend a lot of time watching TV.
35278,PS4,3,339.48,339.6,0.12,2.0,OK.
35278,PS4,3,339.92,348.0,8.08,3.0,"And at least half of them strict regulations for the half of the for at least half of the programs to be, I don't know, education, informative or something."
35278,PS4,3,348.28,352.84,4.56,1.0,"But then that's the same point that if they're not interested, why would they watch that if something else they don't have?"
35278,PS4,3,353.0,353.64,0.64,3.0,Anything that's worse?
35278,PS4,3,354.08,359.24,5.16,1.0,But you said if half of them they would just watch the other half and unfortunately the YouTube things recorded.
35278,PS4,3,359.56,362.8,3.24,1.0,"So I mean it's the same point and I do agree with it, but you then find the only."
35278,PS4,3,362.8,368.52,5.72,2.0,Issue here I think is in ATV show you can elaborate on a billboard you can't elaborate which I think is where.
35278,PS4,3,369.04,374.92,5.88,2.0,"So I get the like, I think that's a really good idea of I've got a, I've seen this problem in class."
35278,PS4,3,374.92,375.68,0.76,2.0,"Oh, it doesn't matter."
35278,PS4,3,375.68,376.84,1.16,2.0,"It's school, like whatever."
35278,PS4,3,376.88,381.28,4.4,2.0,"And then you see it on a harbour packet and you're like, oh, like I think I know this actually."
35278,PS4,3,381.28,383.04,1.76,2.0,So that's where the really good link is.
35278,PS4,3,383.24,396.8,13.56,2.0,"The only the, I think the better thing with a video is they can actually elaborate on it, which is also quite like, you know, another step if you like, to actually giving an explanation to therefore be able to reach those groups like you're saying."
35278,PS4,3,396.8,397.04,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,397.04,400.56,3.52,1.0,"Yeah, but unfortunately I don't think anyone watches government regulated television."
35278,PS4,3,404.64,423.6,18.96,2.0,"But I think if you combine the two ideas and look at kids when like little TV programmes, because usually even in let's say in the worst, like alcoholic mum for example, is very likely to put on bedtime stories or something like journey like for the early years groups."
35278,PS4,3,423.96,432.6,8.64,2.0,"So if there's something integrated in the early years groups that combines those two ideas, then maybe it will target at least a proportion."
35278,PS4,3,432.84,439.28,6.44,1.0,"But at the moment, aren't those television programmes that are targeted for younger ages inherently informative and educational?"
35278,PS4,3,439.92,441.0,1.08,2.0,"I don't know, what do you think?"
35278,PS4,3,441.2,442.84,1.64,1.0,"I think they are, yeah."
35278,PS4,3,442.84,443.88,1.04,1.0,I think it's kind of introduction.
35278,PS4,3,443.92,444.32,0.4,2.0,Basically not.
35278,PS4,3,444.84,445.28,0.44,3.0,All of them.
35278,PS4,3,445.68,447.92,2.24,3.0,There are a few things that my younger siblings watch.
35278,PS4,3,448.28,448.52,0.24,1.0,Like.
35278,PS4,3,449.0,450.72,1.72,3.0,I don't know they're updated or something.
35278,PS4,3,450.84,451.92,1.08,3.0,They aren't really informative.
35278,PS4,3,453.0,457.72,4.72,2.0,So they could add to that and the only other thing is what academic resources?
35278,PS4,3,457.72,462.2,4.48,2.0,I think what you're saying it should be used in school As for an academic.
35278,PS4,3,463.44,475.04,11.6,3.0,Resource mandating private school teachers to teach in public schools in these areas before they can they are eligible to teach in a private school.
35278,PS4,3,476.08,477.04,0.96,2.0,That's a good idea.
35278,PS4,3,477.2,482.76,5.56,2.0,"It Do you think by resource they mean a physical thing like a video, a or do we think no?"
35278,PS4,3,482.76,484.28,1.52,1.0,Do I consider a teacher as a resource?
35278,PS4,3,487.4,488.04,0.64,2.0,This is hard.
35278,PS4,3,489.16,489.48,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,489.48,490.2,0.72,1.0,"No, that's a good point."
35278,PS4,3,492.6,493.6,1.0,1.0,Teachers having to.
35278,PS4,3,493.88,497.72,3.84,3.0,Or please before they get the QTS they need to fulfil.
35278,PS4,3,498.0,499.36,1.36,2.0,"I don't, no."
35278,PS4,3,499.36,501.68,2.32,2.0,You can do your teacher training in a private school if.
35278,PS4,3,503.36,506.4,3.04,3.0,"Now before they get the the licences, I think the."
35278,PS4,3,506.56,518.8,12.24,1.0,"QTS is a but then then aren't you forcing less experienced teachers into the public system and then saying or we'll keep them more experienced counterparts for the private institutions, which is if anything, I'm."
35278,PS4,3,519.16,528.96,9.8,2.0,Pretty sure just have to have at least one public placement while getting their QTS their qualified teacher status I think.
35278,PS4,3,531.36,537.64,6.28,1.0,"But either way, regardless then you would have the most junior teachers in public and then the most senior ones in private, which would create a wider gap."
35278,PS4,3,538.04,538.16,0.12,2.0,Why?
35278,PS4,3,538.28,539.6,1.32,2.0,Why that doesn't happen then?
35278,PS4,3,540.76,544.0,3.24,1.0,"Yeah, I guess some people are just more interested in public schools."
35278,PS4,3,546.52,547.08,0.56,3.0,This is hard.
35278,PS4,3,547.16,549.92,2.76,2.0,One period of overcome inequality in education.
35278,PS4,3,550.16,553.44,3.28,2.0,What about something like providing equipment?
35278,PS4,3,554.28,556.36,2.08,2.0,You don't have to bring your equipment in from home.
35278,PS4,3,556.8,557.96,1.16,2.0,Like as basic as that.
35278,PS4,3,557.96,565.12,7.16,2.0,"Because some parents do not have the money to buy pens, which is what happens in primary school but not in secondary schools."
35278,PS4,3,565.6,567.32,1.72,1.0,Do not provide anything for the.
35278,PS4,3,567.32,572.48,5.16,2.0,"Kids in secondary schools, you have an equipment check and unless this just depends on how good the school is."
35278,PS4,3,572.48,579.8,7.32,2.0,"So if the school's very good at knowing and trying to find out your home situation and what the difficulties and barriers are, they can help you with that."
35278,PS4,3,579.96,581.6,1.64,2.0,But the same goes to uniform.
35278,PS4,3,581.84,589.92,8.08,2.0,"Like if your mum and dad don't have the money and the school isn't very good at kind of engaging with the actual students, then no."
35278,PS4,3,590.88,591.2,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,592.36,595.24,2.88,1.0,So you think it's just a case of plowing more funding into it?
35278,PS4,3,595.8,600.84,5.04,2.0,"I think plan the funding in the right places, which is the same issue in the NHS or anywhere you go, isn't it?"
35278,PS4,3,602.4,605.36,2.96,3.0,These things I don't think are really creative per SE.
35278,PS4,3,612.75,614.71,1.96,3.0,I don't know books with serial boxes.
35278,PS4,3,617.03,618.71,1.68,1.0,"No, OK."
35278,PS4,3,618.75,623.71,4.96,1.0,"The main idea we've had, which we've had critiques for is like having billboard billboards and ads."
35278,PS4,3,623.95,629.24,5.29,1.0,How would you guys tweak that to be more more aligned with your your agreement?
35278,PS4,3,632.44,634.84,2.4,2.0,It would depend on your definition of academic rules.
35278,PS4,3,634.84,639.52,4.68,2.0,"If your definition of an academic results is something that has to be used in school, then you can't use a billboard."
35278,PS4,3,640.28,647.44,7.16,2.0,"Yeah, but you could tweak it into using murals around school, like on the school walls that are educational."
35278,PS4,3,648.16,649.08,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, I like that, actually."
35278,PS4,3,649.24,650.12,0.88,1.0,What about hiring?
35278,PS4,3,650.32,653.32,3.0,1.0,Hiring better artists for school neurons.
35278,PS4,3,653.32,653.68,0.36,2.0,There you go.
35278,PS4,3,654.04,659.96,5.92,2.0,And then you're the idea here would be there's visual representations which target visual learners.
35278,PS4,3,660.32,666.84,6.52,2.0,"There's like creative artistic representations, which for example makes science that call to artists."
35278,PS4,3,667.12,667.44,0.32,1.0,Got it.
35278,PS4,3,668.52,669.36,0.84,1.0,"Yeah, Yeah, That's a good idea."
35278,PS4,3,669.36,669.76,0.4,1.0,That's a good.
35278,PS4,3,669.8,669.96,0.16,2.0,Idea.
35278,PS4,3,670.2,670.68,0.48,1.0,Good idea.
35278,PS4,3,670.72,673.36,2.64,1.0,Different representations of learning concepts.
35278,PS4,3,673.72,676.44,2.72,2.0,From different subjects like from a variety of subjects.
35278,PS4,3,677.04,678.44,1.4,1.0,If you'd say this is stupid.
35278,PS4,3,681.0,694.4,13.4,2.0,In order to engage students who learn differently with hard concepts that they might otherwise disregard because they don't like school or school is too difficult.
35278,PS4,3,694.96,695.16,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,695.88,696.24,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS4,3,696.72,698.08,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, let's do that."
35278,PS4,3,698.44,698.96,0.52,1.0,Perfect.
34402,PS2,3,0.0,501.72,3.16,1.0,Supply chain security near shoring.
34402,PS2,3,503.48,504.16,0.68,1.0,Near shoring.
34402,PS2,3,508.16,515.48,7.32,3.0,"I think it's related to some like operational management and cost control, the elective."
34402,PS2,3,515.8,517.56,1.76,1.0,"Yeah, this is a hard topic."
34402,PS2,3,517.56,523.8,6.24,1.0,"For example, what's happening in pandemics when the supply chain was almost that is was broken."
34402,PS2,3,524.08,525.2,1.12,1.0,So how to fix that?
34402,PS2,3,525.52,529.36,3.84,1.0,What companies are doing now is right to near sure in their process.
34402,PS2,3,529.84,535.88,6.04,1.0,"For example, a before instead of US buying to China, now they are trying to buy to Mexico."
34402,PS2,3,536.92,545.56,8.64,1.0,"It could be good for Mexico, but for China, but for your political things, sure that is not too creative is what is happening right now."
34402,PS2,3,546.16,552.48,6.32,1.0,Everyone wants to have their process or their supply change very close to home to avoid disruptions.
34402,PS2,3,554.2,566.16,11.96,3.0,"I think during the class, the example of Sarah, I think the the process is very creative because they move the actually the production stage into the late stage of the supply chain."
34402,PS2,3,566.52,574.12,7.6,3.0,They don't dye the clothes in front of they they affirm that what consumers want.
34402,PS2,3,574.96,575.36,0.4,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34402,PS2,3,575.36,592.0,16.64,3.0,"So I think in in terms of this, maybe we can also like the ethics they can how to say they can print 3D or 4D3D printing to to do the photo."
34402,PS2,3,593.48,598.08,4.6,3.0,What is the to do the sample when they want to design a new product.
34402,PS2,3,598.32,607.28,8.96,3.0,So they don't need to like to to produce the concept in a very complicated way and supply chain.
34402,PS2,3,609.96,621.56,11.6,2.0,"He mentioned with countries having issues or you know, disruption of say there was a time when a ship got stuck in the canal and there was a global disruption."
34402,PS2,3,621.84,628.08,6.24,2.0,"So those vulnerabilities, the 1st and most easy things which people usually do is have multiple suppliers."
34402,PS2,3,628.84,637.68,8.84,2.0,So if I I'm the US and I'm importing from China or from an India as well then the the at least one of them will work.
34402,PS2,3,637.68,642.0,4.32,2.0,If China and US have a disagreement you are still getting the supplied goods.
34402,PS2,3,642.32,646.64,4.32,1.0,So having more suppliers is the easiest way of doing away with vulnerability.
34402,PS2,3,646.68,649.88,3.2,1.0,So if our relation goes bad I still have other suppliers.
34402,PS2,3,649.88,653.44,3.56,1.0,"If one of the ship gets stuck, other ships will still arrive."
34402,PS2,3,653.8,661.48,7.68,1.0,"So but all of this leads to higher cost because you have multiple supplies, you have multiple ships, everything you create multiple leads."
34402,PS2,3,661.48,661.72,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34402,PS2,3,662.28,665.52,3.24,1.0,"So in creatively solving this, it's very."
34402,PS2,3,666.44,667.04,0.6,1.0,Complicated.
34402,PS2,3,667.04,667.32,0.28,1.0,It's very.
34402,PS2,3,667.64,669.12,1.48,3.0,"Complicated, but there's not creative."
34402,PS2,3,669.16,669.84,0.68,3.0,It's normal.
34402,PS2,3,669.92,676.0,6.08,2.0,"This is this is the normal practice, but creatively solving this will need some very out-of-the-box thing here."
34402,PS2,3,676.52,676.76,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34402,PS2,3,685.88,707.08,21.2,3.0,"I think just like what I said, maybe in the early stage of as possible as much early stages that they can produce standardized products and so that they can more control in the materials they procure."
34402,PS2,3,710.96,720.44,9.48,3.0,"What if like the chips, like the chips between China and the US happen the the shortage of chips?"
34402,PS2,3,722.0,729.24,7.24,2.0,"There's also like, which was the geopolitical as well as at the same time silicon it's."
34402,PS2,3,730.16,730.68,0.52,3.0,So hard.
34402,PS2,3,731.52,732.16,0.64,2.0,The newest scale.
34402,PS2,3,732.96,734.48,1.52,1.0,Of control.
34402,PS2,3,734.48,739.72,5.24,1.0,I need to book book something.
34402,PS2,3,771.89,773.09,1.2,1.0,I have an idea.
34402,PS2,3,773.09,775.41,2.32,1.0,I know I'm not sure how to structure it.
34402,PS2,3,775.88,780.0,4.12,1.0,It's like try to charge the customer with this problems.
34402,PS2,3,780.16,789.4,9.24,1.0,"I mean when there is no problem you charge them, I don't know more or less than when there is the this disruption problems, right?"
34402,PS2,3,789.64,803.04,13.4,1.0,It's like you try to compensate the one who receive their their products in fast way contrary to the one who has problems or delays in the the liberal of the products.
34402,PS2,3,803.4,805.24,1.84,1.0,And I'm not sure how to structure.
34402,PS2,3,805.84,808.24,2.4,1.0,"So if you have a problem, I'll give it to you for cheaper."
34402,PS2,3,810.2,813.28,3.08,1.0,And the one who receiving time the problem with like a little fee.
34402,PS2,3,813.36,820.92,7.56,2.0,"What happens with this is, so I worked with in supply chain and the biggest problem that happens is whenever there is a disruption, your cost actually goes up."
34402,PS2,3,821.48,826.92,5.44,2.0,"So it becomes very difficult to discount the product for a customer because the gap, the negative gap that you have."
34402,PS2,3,827.88,835.52,7.64,2.0,"So in a standard business as usual scenario, you're spending £10 on getting something and you're selling it for 12 lbs."
34402,PS2,3,835.88,842.32,6.44,2.0,"But in a disruption scenario, the 10 lbs cost becomes 14 sometimes, so you can't give it for anything less than 1200."
34402,PS2,3,842.52,843.64,1.12,1.0,You can give 8.
34402,PS2,3,855.9,864.18,8.28,1.0,"It's very hard topic because if you try to diversify your suppliers, that's basically contrary to the specialization."
34402,PS2,3,865.06,865.78,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, a concept."
34402,PS2,3,865.82,878.36,12.54,1.0,"Instead of having countries or nation who specialize in some materials, on raw materials, you will have all countries making the same, maybe in a very inefficient ways to avoid disruptions."
34402,PS2,3,879.88,880.68,0.8,1.0,There is a trip out.
34402,PS2,3,886.24,888.16,1.92,1.0,"Oh, these topics are harder than yesterday."
34402,PS2,3,896.2,897.12,0.92,2.0,This is only.
34402,PS2,3,897.52,906.92,9.4,1.0,"Thing that we can do, let's say for a few more minutes after time's run."

34402,PS2,3,942.64,944.4,1.76,3.0,It's not creative.
34402,PS2,3,944.4,944.88,0.48,3.0,OK.
34402,PS2,3,946.56,950.52,3.96,3.0,Like to negotiate about the cost Also not creative.

34402,PS2,3,975.92,981.92,6.0,1.0,"For a having or knowing the demand, but the problem is with the disruptions."
34402,PS2,3,982.52,995.12,12.6,1.0,"For example, you have a problem with the with this channel or with pandemic, it's like disrupt all this plane change and even if you know the demand you can produce because you don't have your supplies."
34402,PS2,3,996.68,999.36,2.68,3.0,"Wow, we we don't ask ChatGPT no."

34402,PS2,3,1005.48,1007.4,1.92,1.0,"Yeah, yes, we cannot use Internet."
34402,PS2,3,1007.44,1012.8,5.36,2.0,"Or yeah, essentially doing this to compare our answers with ChatGPT."
34402,PS2,3,1012.8,1016.84,4.04,2.0,They really study is AI versus human creativity.
34402,PS2,3,1017.72,1018.44,0.72,1.0,Who's more creative?
34402,PS2,3,1018.64,1020.08,1.44,2.0,And then I'll just submit this one.
34402,PS2,3,1021.04,1022.84,1.8,1.0,"Alright, yes, I don't think we can."
34428,PS1,3,29.04,31.24,2.2,2.0,Oh my God some of these are really intense.
34428,PS1,3,32.12,32.84,0.72,2.0,How's the end?
34428,PS1,3,32.84,33.8,0.96,2.0,Plastic pollution.
34428,PS1,3,34.16,34.68,0.52,1.0,Oh my God.
34428,PS1,3,37.16,44.8,7.64,1.0,"Oh, so there's a like a city in Lebanon where they use plastic to somehow generate electricity?"
34428,PS1,3,44.96,46.28,1.32,2.0,"Oh, that would be good."
34428,PS1,3,46.36,47.0,0.64,2.0,Two birds.
34428,PS1,3,47.28,48.48,1.2,2.0,Two birds with one stone.

34428,PS1,3,50.0,55.28,5.28,2.0,Come up with a You just burn it like coal.
34428,PS1,3,58.04,60.28,2.24,2.0,I think maybe that's more of an environmental problem.
34428,PS1,3,63.08,63.6,0.52,2.0,I don't know.
34428,PS1,3,63.68,69.72,6.04,2.0,"That must be like some way I I can think of those of ideas, but they're already ideas."
34428,PS1,3,70.68,74.88,4.2,1.0,"Maybe we can make it general and just say being able to reuse it, yeah."
34428,PS1,3,76.44,79.2,2.76,3.0,Also some bio materials can replace them.
34428,PS1,3,82.32,91.04,8.72,2.0,"So should I say we use existing plastic and like rather than making more, make it from more sustainable?"
34428,PS1,3,110.92,113.04,2.12,2.0,Use like biodegradable.
34428,PS1,3,113.6,117.88,4.28,2.0,How do you spell biodegrade?
34428,PS1,3,118.4,119.0,0.6,2.0,Is that right?
34428,PS1,3,120.12,120.76,0.64,2.0,Degrade.
34428,PS1,3,121.28,121.92,0.64,1.0,Double OK.
34428,PS1,3,129.48,130.08,0.6,2.0,Is that good?
34428,PS1,3,131.12,134.32,3.2,2.0,Should we go on to the next one?
34428,PS1,3,134.32,134.6,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS6,3,2.6,4.88,2.28,1.0,"OK, imagine a new research study discount."
36144,PS6,3,5.44,5.84,0.4,2.0,Singing.
36144,PS6,3,5.84,10.44,4.6,1.0,"In the show, OK Oh my God, please."

36144,PS6,3,13.68,20.88,7.2,3.0,OK maybe like putting a display free display in the shower with like YouTube videos and karaoke.
36144,PS6,3,21.16,21.92,0.76,1.0,"Oh, that's true."
36144,PS6,3,21.92,22.96,1.04,1.0,"Oh, that will."
36144,PS6,3,23.0,24.2,1.2,2.0,Be yo.
36144,PS6,3,24.6,28.24,3.64,3.0,Or that actually you earn money if you if you do that.
36144,PS6,3,28.56,29.8,1.24,2.0,Oh.
36144,PS6,3,30.12,37.08,6.96,3.0,In some ways is or you pay less the hot water or you pay less taxes on this kind of stuff.
36144,PS6,3,37.56,40.2,2.64,3.0,I guess like earning money is the best instant you're always.
36144,PS6,3,41.24,42.24,1.0,2.0,But then it's good for you.
36144,PS6,3,44.56,48.96,4.4,1.0,"Like, I mean, we all paid so much towards healthcare or like insurance."
36144,PS6,3,49.52,54.72,5.2,1.0,"So if you do that and if actually it's proven that you if you do that, it's improving your health, they can."
36144,PS6,3,54.72,54.96,0.24,3.0,Like.
36144,PS6,3,55.4,57.6,2.2,1.0,I guess pay out some of your insurance from the.
36144,PS6,3,57.6,58.2,0.6,3.0,Government side.
36144,PS6,3,58.56,58.72,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS6,3,59.8,63.52,3.72,1.0,"And you know, OK, wait, what is our one creature idea?"
36144,PS6,3,65.04,68.92,3.88,3.0,"Though, OK, OK."
36144,PS6,3,68.92,74.92,6.0,3.0,Like a kind of system with like karaoke and video that register your voice.
36144,PS6,3,74.92,79.84,4.92,3.0,"So it actually, it actually proved that you have done it."
36144,PS6,3,80.08,84.0,3.92,3.0,"And if you for 20 minutes have done this, you get some money."
36144,PS6,3,84.16,90.64,6.48,3.0,"Because I think that if you get money, you are more convinced than if you don't pay for the the insurance."
36144,PS6,3,90.64,93.76,3.12,3.0,"Yeah, something like that."
36144,PS6,3,95.4,106.28,10.88,2.0,"Actually, I, I know a study showed that like, like if you speak or like you use energy to speak or sing, maybe that can generate into like electricity."
36144,PS6,3,106.8,115.48,8.68,2.0,"So could that be like maybe we also like tie that into like maybe not lowering like insurance because like, I don't know how they would like know for sure."
36144,PS6,3,115.48,117.92,2.44,2.0,"We could just be talking and that's not really singing, right."
36144,PS6,3,118.32,129.76,11.44,2.0,"So maybe if like you're actually singing and they can register like certain frequencies of that singing, turn that into electricity, then it's like you lower your electricity bill."
36144,PS6,3,129.8,130.36,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36144,PS6,3,130.88,131.88,1.0,2.0,"I don't know, yeah."
36144,PS6,3,132.16,132.84,0.68,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, it's fine."
36144,PS6,3,133.72,134.48,0.76,3.0,I think we can.
36144,PS6,3,134.48,135.6,1.12,1.0,"We could do that, yeah."
36144,PS6,3,136.04,138.6,2.56,2.0,I don't know if that study is real or not I think.
36144,PS6,3,138.8,139.64,0.84,3.0,But we I mean.
36144,PS6,3,139.64,140.96,1.32,1.0,We don't have to site the study.
36144,PS6,3,140.96,141.52,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36144,PS6,3,141.52,141.76,0.24,3.0,"OK, OK."
36144,PS6,3,142.6,143.64,1.04,3.0,I think it's fine.
36144,PS6,3,143.64,145.56,1.92,1.0,You can say scientists need to develop this.
36144,PS6,3,145.96,146.28,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS6,3,148.64,150.76,2.12,2.0,Maybe at certain frequencies you will get.
36144,PS6,3,151.4,151.84,0.44,3.0,"You know, no."
36144,PS6,3,151.84,153.04,1.2,3.0,"OK, so basically."
36144,PS6,3,154.0,154.76,0.76,1.0,Do you want to type?
36144,PS6,3,155.56,156.48,0.92,2.0,"Sure, I can try."
36144,PS6,3,156.88,161.08,4.2,1.0,"Because I think you see, I'm I'm a lawyer, so the last question was easy for me."
36144,PS6,3,162.12,164.04,1.92,3.0,"So you're really like, good like."
36144,PS6,3,166.24,170.76,4.52,2.0,"OK, so creating a device."
36144,PS6,3,171.0,172.48,1.48,3.0,"Yeah, creating a device."
36144,PS6,3,173.96,207.88,33.92,2.0,"A device that picks up on certain frequencies, vocal frequencies, uncertain vocal frequencies which could then kind of possibly generate electricity, thus lowering."
36144,PS6,3,208.88,209.4,0.52,1.0,Power bills.
36144,PS6,3,210.4,230.2,19.8,2.0,"Yeah, electricity bills, lowering household electricity, I don't know."
36144,PS6,3,234.28,236.64,2.36,2.0,What else were we saying to like?
36144,PS6,3,237.64,252.08,14.44,1.0,"We can say then this is like, you know, this ensures accountability that this is this ensures both accountability that they sing, but also in in a place puts in place an incentive structure."
36144,PS6,3,252.4,255.04,2.64,2.0,"OK, accountable."
36144,PS6,3,255.04,257.0,1.96,2.0,Do I say the word accountability in this case?
36144,PS6,3,257.44,257.68,0.24,1.0,OK.
36144,PS6,3,257.68,259.16,1.48,1.0,Then incentive structure this.
36144,PS6,3,259.72,260.88,1.16,2.0,This incentivizes.
36144,PS6,3,260.96,265.68,4.72,1.0,"Yeah, because all they want is encourage people, Yeah."
36144,PS6,3,266.32,269.64,3.32,3.0,But you can also put like songs.
36144,PS6,3,270.84,279.48,8.64,3.0,"So I think the device should recognize like, I think it should be tailored for the voice of the person that lives there."
36144,PS6,3,280.4,283.84,3.44,3.0,Otherwise you could put like your phone with some songs.
36144,PS6,3,284.32,285.0,0.68,2.0,OK.
36144,PS6,3,285.04,289.6,4.56,3.0,And the frequency will be will be high and it's not necessary that you see.
36144,PS6,3,290.76,294.32,3.56,3.0,"So like the device should recognize I think, the voice of the specific person and."
36144,PS6,3,294.36,295.48,1.12,2.0,The vocal recognition.
36144,PS6,3,295.48,295.72,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS6,3,297.0,316.28,19.28,2.0,Using a vocal record you I don't think I want this kind of device in my house to be honest this is the devices people this thing and in the shower which.
36144,PS6,3,317.0,322.16,5.16,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, maybe we can for the sake of write a privacy, add data, can't be."
36144,PS6,3,325.2,325.88,0.68,3.0,"Yeah, it's true."
36144,PS6,3,325.92,326.48,0.56,3.0,Something that.
36144,PS6,3,326.64,327.6,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, OK."
36144,PS6,3,327.64,329.52,1.88,2.0,"As a lawyer, how do we how do we write down?"
36144,PS6,3,330.48,333.6,3.12,1.0,"No, I was just thinking about it like when you said, oh, I want, I don't know."
36144,PS6,3,333.72,334.44,0.72,2.0,"That in my, yeah."
36144,PS6,3,340.28,346.28,6.0,1.0,"Yeah, I guess to evade like not to evade to ensure."
36144,PS6,3,346.28,349.0,2.72,1.0,Why is this OK to ensure?
36144,PS6,3,349.0,350.36,1.36,2.0,"Oh, it became Chinese."
36144,PS6,3,350.36,350.8,0.44,1.0,Oh no.
36144,PS6,3,350.8,352.4,1.6,2.0,How do you change the?
36144,PS6,3,352.64,356.0,3.36,2.0,Is it this is it?
36144,PS6,3,356.6,357.0,0.4,1.0,Now.
36144,PS6,3,358.44,359.36,0.92,2.0,"OK, nice."
36144,PS6,3,363.96,367.44,3.48,1.0,To ensure ethical data management practices.
36144,PS6,3,367.6,368.52,0.92,2.0,"Yo, you are a lawyer."
36144,PS6,3,368.52,369.12,0.6,2.0,Let's go.
36144,PS6,3,370.2,370.36,0.16,1.0,No.
36144,PS6,3,372.88,386.44,13.56,1.0,"The device should store all data locally within, like the server in the household I guess, and consistently delete all data."
36144,PS6,3,386.44,387.08,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36144,PS6,3,387.4,387.52,0.12,2.0,Cool.
36144,PS6,3,388.8,393.8,5.0,3.0,But do you think you would be incentivized with this incentivize enough to do that?
36144,PS6,3,395.0,396.12,1.12,2.0,I would if I think.
36144,PS6,3,396.12,396.52,0.4,1.0,So.
36144,PS6,3,396.8,402.32,5.52,3.0,"But if you are in college, then you wouldn't care too much about household electricity bills, right?"
36144,PS6,3,403.2,406.48,3.28,3.0,So maybe something that like every week collect.
36144,PS6,3,406.52,407.28,0.76,1.0,The sewing.
36144,PS6,3,408.08,415.08,7.0,3.0,Code if you like overcome the 20 minutes of syncing like every after every week you get some money back I think.
36144,PS6,3,416.0,416.8,0.8,2.0,Cash back on yeah.
36144,PS6,3,416.8,417.48,0.68,3.0,Cash back.
36144,PS6,3,417.76,418.16,0.4,1.0,In.
36144,PS6,3,418.48,420.76,2.28,3.0,But in real cash or in real?
36144,PS6,3,420.76,422.0,1.24,1.0,"Oh my God, my dad."
36144,PS6,3,423.16,424.8,1.64,2.0,But then who will be giving the money?
36144,PS6,3,424.84,425.16,0.32,2.0,That's the.
36144,PS6,3,425.48,434.12,8.64,3.0,"Thing, but if the if it's really good for your health, the government would pay because it would save in like health expenses, correct?"
36144,PS6,3,434.8,435.04,0.24,2.0,Correct.
36144,PS6,3,435.04,439.0,3.96,3.0,"Like NHS, yeah, but if it's really, I mean, this is like creative, but."
36144,PS6,3,439.84,440.6,0.76,2.0,That's true.
36144,PS6,3,440.92,443.08,2.16,2.0,"You know what they say, Creative, not accurate."
36144,PS6,3,443.24,443.96,0.72,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36144,PS6,3,444.08,445.64,1.56,3.0,So we we can invent everything.
36144,PS6,3,445.64,445.92,0.28,3.0,"OK, OK."
36144,PS6,3,446.28,446.4,0.12,2.0,OK.
36144,PS6,3,451.96,456.52,4.56,2.0,Or college accommodation because technically you guys don't have to pay for.
36144,PS6,3,459.36,467.88,8.52,1.0,It so a payment based incentive structure would work.
36144,PS6,3,467.96,468.52,0.56,3.0,Best.
36144,PS6,3,468.72,469.24,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
36144,PS6,3,470.2,478.28,8.08,1.0,"This the such incentives should be, sorry, provided by the government."

36144,PS6,3,481.44,484.04,2.6,2.0,"I said, I guess it lessens the burden on."

35587,PS4,3,49.04,49.76,0.72,2.0,"Scholarship, yeah, sorry."
35587,PS4,3,49.76,53.6,3.84,2.0,And things like that.
35587,PS4,3,53.6,57.32,3.72,2.0,I guess that's one thing.
35587,PS4,3,58.4,67.28,8.88,1.0,"I'm not sure how to, like, interpret creative, you know, like, how does that have to be like really like out-of-the-box, like something that isn't new or something, something really new."
35587,PS4,3,67.28,67.92,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, educational."
35587,PS4,3,70.16,76.0,5.84,3.0,Inequality for distribution of resources.
35587,PS4,3,81.88,95.2,13.32,3.0,"OK, I for one can say I think I've seen first hand people with educational inequality and it comes with lack of money."
35587,PS4,3,95.8,96.96,1.16,3.0,Like I think that's the problem.
35587,PS4,3,96.96,105.52,8.56,3.0,"First, there's always lack of finance and sometimes I don't know back from where I come from."
35587,PS4,3,105.6,130.16,24.56,3.0,"Sometimes it's not the money, but some studies was carried out and then some people said that the time that the children go to school, it will be a time where they will go and source for money like maybe Hawking or going to some maybe shops or some kind of work to bring to the family."
35587,PS4,3,130.44,140.36,9.92,3.0,"While money is a problem too, I think that also this subjective perspective to education too when it comes to parent."
35587,PS4,3,141.92,143.52,1.6,1.0,So I think.
35587,PS4,3,143.52,147.72,4.2,3.0,One would bring out all the problems and we're able to bring out the solution.
35587,PS4,3,147.88,149.2,1.32,3.0,What problems do you think?
35587,PS4,3,150.92,153.04,2.12,2.0,"I mean, yeah, you, you, you."
35587,PS4,3,153.48,158.64,5.16,2.0,"Obviously, you know, when you have private schools, the problem usually is money because not everyone can afford them."
35587,PS4,3,159.16,172.2,13.04,2.0,"On the other hand, if you had proper public education then even people like like higher quality public education, people wouldn't need more money."
35587,PS4,3,173.16,174.4,1.24,2.0,"Sorry, I'm just trying to no."
35587,PS4,3,174.44,175.12,0.68,3.0,"It's OK, it's."
35587,PS4,3,177.64,177.96,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35587,PS4,3,178.8,181.72,2.92,2.0,So you could either like force private schools to.
35587,PS4,3,182.32,182.52,0.2,3.0,Like.
35587,PS4,3,182.52,193.8,11.28,2.0,"Take children from the I know lower economic status, or just enforce the public sector, or both."
35587,PS4,3,195.16,196.96,1.8,3.0,"OK, Yeah, that's that's a good idea too."
35587,PS4,3,197.0,209.88,12.88,3.0,"You know, maybe there could be like a maybe a percentage of the low social, lower social economic group that could be picked because when it comes to private, they're always profit oriented."
35587,PS4,3,210.28,215.52,5.24,3.0,"So when you tell them to just pick all the people, maybe some kind of maybe percentage."
35587,PS4,3,215.64,217.32,1.68,1.0,But there might still be inequality.
35587,PS4,3,217.56,220.76,3.2,1.0,"It it would, I mean, what, what, how are you picking them?"
35587,PS4,3,220.76,225.32,4.56,1.0,"And like, however you pick them, then who, who's not being picked to be an actual margin?"
35587,PS4,3,226.2,232.68,6.48,1.0,"I like, I, I, I agree a lot with like the sort of subjective role with like the, the role that the family has."
35587,PS4,3,232.76,247.4,14.64,1.0,"Like this, your support network has in like encouraging you to sort of make the most of your education, Like, because you know, state schools by and large give you everything you need for a good education as long as you can take advantage of it."
35587,PS4,3,248.48,254.6,6.12,1.0,"So maybe there's something like, because I don't think it's here, a lot of people sort of targeting that aspect of the, of the inequality."
35587,PS4,3,255.4,259.6,4.2,1.0,So maybe there's some like creative idea I don't.
35587,PS4,3,260.8,274.2,13.4,2.0,"Also, I don't know like in in how many regions books are like given free As for free from the institution, either private or public or whether you have to buy them."
35587,PS4,3,274.64,277.88,3.24,2.0,"So if you have to buy them, then it's an extra challenge."
35587,PS4,3,278.64,302.08,23.44,2.0,"So maybe another idea would be like distribute books for free so that even if you cannot attend school for working reasons or distance reasons or whatever, if you can't do it like, you know, mentally and you technically you could try to study yourself, which is obviously not going to be you're not going to be."
35587,PS4,3,302.76,307.08,4.32,3.0,"So you have one solution, distribution of rhythm materials, right?"
35587,PS4,3,307.68,307.8,0.12,3.0,OK.
35587,PS4,3,309.4,310.32,0.92,1.0,Closing private schools.
35587,PS4,3,311.04,312.32,1.28,3.0,Closing private schools?
35587,PS4,3,312.32,312.44,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35587,PS4,3,313.84,317.48,3.64,2.0,No one's going to agree to that because there's a lot of money at stake.
35587,PS4,3,317.68,319.6,1.92,3.0,"Yeah, Investment A."
35587,PS4,3,319.6,319.92,0.32,1.0,Little bit.
35587,PS4,3,319.92,320.32,0.4,1.0,It's crazy.
35587,PS4,3,326.12,331.2,5.08,1.0,"I mean, yeah, it's not it's not that far fetched an idea."
35587,PS4,3,331.28,332.76,1.48,1.0,Like a lot of people opposed it.
35587,PS4,3,334.12,344.28,10.16,1.0,You can even like have like an education or like a tax on a bigger tax on private schools to pay for state school funding or a tax on people who send their kids to private schools.
35587,PS4,3,344.28,344.32,0.04,1.0,I.
35587,PS4,3,345.72,352.2,6.48,2.0,Like this one better because if you increase the tax in private schools and the intuition fees.
35587,PS4,3,353.12,353.16,0.04,1.0,I.
35587,PS4,3,353.16,353.6,0.44,2.0,Think the.
35587,PS4,3,353.68,354.2,0.52,3.0,Subsequent.
35587,PS4,3,354.2,358.04,3.84,2.0,"Increase as well shows, yeah, a big counterproductive so."
35587,PS4,3,362.64,364.2,1.56,3.0,"I don't know, I was thinking also that."
35587,PS4,3,366.52,367.8,1.28,2.0,And obviously I mean.
35587,PS4,3,368.36,369.16,0.8,3.0,"Go ahead, go ahead."
35587,PS4,3,369.72,375.56,5.84,2.0,I mean I I would say like ban children's from working but if it's the only way.
35587,PS4,3,375.72,376.16,0.44,1.0,They can.
35587,PS4,3,376.16,377.0,0.84,1.0,"I mean, it's already tagged."
35587,PS4,3,377.0,379.12,2.12,2.0,"That the family can survive then, you know, Yeah."
35587,PS4,3,379.6,381.6,2.0,1.0,Are we assuming the UK or?
35587,PS4,3,382.08,384.32,2.24,2.0,"I honestly, I don't know, I'm just thinking a bit, yeah."
35587,PS4,3,384.4,384.88,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, fair enough."
35587,PS4,3,385.08,387.88,2.8,3.0,Probably that maybe we shouldn't be just.
35587,PS4,3,389.2,393.28,4.08,2.0,"I mean, I'm from Greece, so you know, like I'm kind of biased towards Greece."
35587,PS4,3,393.28,398.76,5.48,2.0,"Then they also like compare with the UK and then I'm like, OK, what, what about the other countries?"
35587,PS4,3,398.76,407.48,8.72,2.0,"I'm just, I don't know what else."
35587,PS4,3,408.88,409.96,1.08,2.0,How much time do we have?
35587,PS4,3,410.52,411.0,0.48,1.0,5 minutes.
35587,PS4,3,411.88,412.32,0.44,2.0,5 minutes.
35587,PS4,3,412.92,413.16,0.24,2.0,"OK, OK."
35587,PS4,3,413.2,418.16,4.96,2.0,Do you want to write what we have in the box and then we can?
35587,PS4,3,422.32,422.64,0.32,1.0,Additional.
35587,PS4,3,423.56,423.68,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35587,PS4,3,424.28,424.72,0.44,1.0,"Sorry, go."
35587,PS4,3,425.64,434.0,8.36,3.0,"Ahead, I think we have like distribution of reading materials and we have a high tax on the private schools."
35587,PS4,3,434.6,435.88,1.28,1.0,We want only one idea though.
35587,PS4,3,435.88,436.04,0.16,1.0,Only.
35587,PS4,3,436.72,436.88,0.16,3.0,1
35587,PS4,3,437.36,437.6,0.24,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
35587,PS4,3,439.6,444.52,4.92,1.0,"I think if if we're considering this worldwide, like a global scheme to distribute reading materials."
35587,PS4,3,444.52,448.96,4.44,1.0,So like every kid has like just a basic set like at the bait.
35587,PS4,3,449.52,465.64,16.12,3.0,"Is another thing I was thinking with the reading material, I was thinking if there could be like a localizer maybe in each locality there's this teaching tutorials that go on maybe for one or two hours, you know, maybe I don't."
35587,PS4,3,466.12,469.48,3.36,1.0,Know or like a like a remote learning.
35587,PS4,3,471.12,471.84,0.72,3.0,If you say you read.
35587,PS4,3,471.92,472.68,0.76,1.0,Electricity.
35587,PS4,3,472.96,474.52,1.56,3.0,Electricity comes into yeah.
35587,PS4,3,477.04,478.24,1.2,1.0,Should we go with the taxes thing?
35587,PS4,3,481.36,481.88,0.52,1.0,Consider me.
35587,PS4,3,481.88,482.32,0.44,1.0,I don't know.
35587,PS4,3,482.32,482.64,0.32,1.0,I don't know.
35587,PS4,3,484.08,484.36,0.28,3.0,I like.
35587,PS4,3,484.64,486.16,1.52,2.0,"The books, more the books."
35587,PS4,3,486.16,486.32,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
35587,PS4,3,486.64,486.88,0.24,3.0,OK.
35587,PS4,3,486.96,491.76,4.8,3.0,"So if I think if the books is like distributed, you understand."
35587,PS4,3,492.12,493.92,1.8,3.0,But the problem is how do they read it?
35587,PS4,3,493.92,498.44,4.52,3.0,"Because now we're looking at people who don't have access to education, they will not be able to read."
35587,PS4,3,499.0,506.28,7.28,3.0,"So while we're given this distribution of group, maybe there should be like a local teaching, I don't know."
35587,PS4,3,508.72,512.56,3.84,3.0,There should be like a localized school within each community.
35587,PS4,3,513.48,513.6,0.12,2.0,OK.
35587,PS4,3,514.36,527.56,13.2,2.0,"Just for like breathing or for the first class of primary, first year of primary school stuff so that maybe they can like set the basis to be able to study."
35587,PS4,3,527.56,529.16,1.6,2.0,I don't know what I'm talking about.
35587,PS4,3,530.16,530.24,0.08,2.0,I'm.
35587,PS4,3,532.36,532.52,0.16,1.0,Sorry.
35587,PS4,3,532.52,534.28,1.76,1.0,"OK, so so there's a."
35587,PS4,3,535.0,535.32,0.32,3.0,Lot there's.
35587,PS4,3,537.32,538.4,1.08,2.0,"OK, so."
35587,PS4,3,541.16,542.68,1.52,1.0,It's like a global book distribution.
35587,PS4,3,542.68,546.6,3.92,2.0,Word free or add the word free someone just to be more.
35587,PS4,3,553.08,566.2,13.12,1.0,Clear go feedback distribution team so that everyone has equal basic or equal access to basic.
35587,PS4,3,577.68,578.0,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35587,PS4,3,579.76,586.4,6.64,1.0,And we could say like could try to provide tutors to as many areas as possible.
35587,PS4,3,598.68,600.2,1.52,2.0,To set the basis basis.
35587,PS4,3,602.28,602.64,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35587,PS4,3,604.2,605.6,1.4,2.0,"To set the first basis, yeah."
35587,PS4,3,605.88,612.96,7.08,1.0,Or something like that.
35587,PS4,3,612.96,615.32,2.36,1.0,"Yeah, happy."
35587,PS4,3,616.64,616.76,0.12,2.0,Cool.
35493,PS4,3,4.96,5.2,0.24,1.0,Oh my.
35493,PS4,3,6.24,6.36,0.12,2.0,God.
35493,PS4,3,7.72,8.48,0.76,3.0,It's a big one.
35493,PS4,3,8.48,12.16,3.68,1.0,"Yeah, is."
35493,PS4,3,12.24,23.96,11.72,3.0,"That an equal distribution, is it inequality in terms of access or inequality in terms of outcomes because that."
35493,PS4,3,25.56,27.0,1.44,2.0,"Well, it seems like access because."
35493,PS4,3,27.16,29.04,1.88,3.0,"Yeah, states access."
35493,PS4,3,29.72,30.16,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,33.64,36.0,2.36,3.0,What is going on with this pasting?
35493,PS4,3,63.4,76.76,13.36,3.0,"I mean, this isn't like that creative or would help that much, but it would be cool if there is one school like in the country or whatever where everybody could be like randomly selected to join it."
35493,PS4,3,77.24,92.28,15.04,3.0,"Or maybe like you stratified the population and said we're going to randomly select like this, the this many people from this demographic and then like you just get some random sample at this like super well funded, like elite school and then see what happens."
35493,PS4,3,92.28,100.44,8.16,3.0,"But there are obviously a lot of problems there 'cause like you would have to opt in and that would, there would be bias in terms of who opts in."
35493,PS4,3,100.96,106.76,5.8,3.0,And it's also only a small like amount.
35493,PS4,3,146.78,156.2,9.42,1.0,I know this is crazy and not practical at all but I'm thinking about just don't educate any people and that we will achieve.
35493,PS4,3,157.2,157.56,0.36,3.0,Yes.
35493,PS4,3,158.2,158.6,0.4,1.0,Equality.
35493,PS4,3,161.6,162.52,0.92,3.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35493,PS4,3,163.0,163.8,0.8,3.0,That is true.
35493,PS4,3,163.88,166.84,2.96,1.0,"Yeah, so the educational equality won't exist anymore."
35493,PS4,3,168.88,181.76,12.88,3.0,"But I think, I think it would within households, you know, like people wouldn't give up unless you just ban books and knowledge completely, which would solve the problem."
35493,PS4,3,182.28,187.68,5.4,3.0,"I mean, it's like any of these can technically be solved with blow up the Earth."
35493,PS4,3,188.68,194.68,6.0,3.0,"You know, it's like we should just answer that for everyone."
35493,PS4,3,200.64,210.96,10.32,2.0,"I'm thinking with technology, I'm keeping that at school, but then they would have to show up to like the actual school to, to use that or yeah, because grants may not work."
35493,PS4,3,211.24,218.16,6.92,2.0,"Or if you give like laptops or something at home, there's no guarantee that they will keep it."
35493,PS4,3,218.52,219.68,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35493,PS4,3,220.36,222.24,1.88,3.0,I feel like that already happens too.
35493,PS4,3,222.24,222.48,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,224.32,225.76,1.44,2.0,But I'm getting paid to go to school.
35493,PS4,3,225.76,226.0,0.24,2.0,That's.
35493,PS4,3,229.24,231.92,2.68,3.0,"Right, that's not yeah, pay people to go to."
35493,PS4,3,232.56,234.16,1.6,1.0,School getting their education.
35493,PS4,3,234.36,234.68,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,235.76,236.36,0.6,3.0,Would that be?
35493,PS4,3,236.36,253.2,16.84,3.0,"Yeah, I mean like government incentives only for like, I guess marginalized or disadvantaged groups to hit a certain thing or like tax write offs or tax benefits or something."
35493,PS4,3,253.72,254.72,1.0,3.0,I think that's interesting.
35493,PS4,3,257.52,259.4,1.88,3.0,"That doesn't exist, does it?"
35493,PS4,3,259.68,261.64,1.96,3.0,Is there like an ethical reason for that?
35493,PS4,3,261.64,263.72,2.08,1.0,"Yeah, maybe."
35493,PS4,3,263.72,266.68,2.96,1.0,Not sure they do.
35493,PS4,3,267.24,271.48,4.24,1.0,I think people are doing it in a little way because like scholarships.
35493,PS4,3,271.56,272.28,0.72,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35493,PS4,3,273.6,276.68,3.08,1.0,Something like that for especially disadvantaged groups.
35493,PS4,3,278.2,278.32,0.12,2.0,Right.
35493,PS4,3,278.48,279.72,1.24,2.0,And the rest of my Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,280.6,290.96,10.36,3.0,I feel like I feel like that could cause issues though in that like if parents were like OK if my kid gets a certain SAT score then I'm going to get money.
35493,PS4,3,290.96,293.44,2.48,3.0,Like that could get very abusive I think.
35493,PS4,3,294.28,303.28,9.0,3.0,So is there a way you could like incentivize the children themselves and somehow keep the parents out of it?
35493,PS4,3,303.28,303.4,0.12,3.0,Well.
35493,PS4,3,304.88,305.64,0.76,2.0,You can open like a.
35493,PS4,3,306.36,308.32,1.96,1.0,"Bank account, yeah."
35493,PS4,3,308.72,310.08,1.36,2.0,"Yeah, the government has access."
35493,PS4,3,310.44,311.24,0.8,1.0,After you graduate.
35493,PS4,3,311.64,312.24,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35493,PS4,3,312.68,314.32,1.64,2.0,You and only you can take out the money.
35493,PS4,3,314.32,314.72,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,314.84,314.96,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,317.08,320.68,3.6,1.0,But I'm still thinking about how that how that we can avoid parents.
35493,PS4,3,321.4,329.28,7.88,3.0,"Yeah, 'cause a parent could still be like, you live in my house, like, I'm taking your money, you know, it has to be something that's only of value to the kid."
35493,PS4,3,333.04,344.92,11.88,3.0,"But like, you could say OK, like a scholarship, but a kid who already isn't incentivized to get educated is not going to work hard to get a scholarship for school he doesn't care about."
35493,PS4,3,353.12,354.04,0.92,3.0,Maybe like.
35493,PS4,3,366.64,386.2,19.56,3.0,"This is also saying like unequal distribution of academic resources, but is does the issue mainly lie in the distribution or in like a larger kind of issue like access like I don't know, medication?"
35493,PS4,3,386.84,387.12,0.28,1.0,System.
35493,PS4,3,387.84,392.36,4.52,3.0,"Yeah, well, I guess there definitely is unequal distribution though."
35493,PS4,3,393.88,397.6,3.72,3.0,"But even where there isn't unequal distribution, there is still a problem."
35493,PS4,3,397.6,405.24,7.64,3.0,I guess is what to overcome.
35493,PS4,3,408.76,412.0,3.24,1.0,"Well, I'm actually thinking about this kind of legacy thing as well."
35493,PS4,3,412.12,421.48,9.36,1.0,"Like if you're going into education, you're you're going to like accumulating money and that money is going to go to the next generation."
35493,PS4,3,421.52,425.8,4.28,1.0,The problem is not everybody's going to like have a child or something like that.
35493,PS4,3,426.88,432.84,5.96,3.0,"Yeah, overcome."
35493,PS4,3,451.36,453.48,2.12,3.0,Can we use TikTok here somehow?
35493,PS4,3,454.88,456.16,1.28,3.0,Tik Tok's very meta.
35493,PS4,3,458.52,464.52,6.0,3.0,"And I feel like like honestly, the best way to access younger generations is brain rot."
35493,PS4,3,464.68,468.8,4.12,3.0,"You know, like if you can get the algorithm to show them something that's."
35493,PS4,3,469.52,469.64,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,470.28,474.32,4.04,3.0,"That's the best way to do that, but I guess that also doesn't get resources in their hands."
35493,PS4,3,497.59,505.55,7.96,3.0,"I mean, I still think some kind of like centralized in terms of like resources, some kind of centralized thing."
35493,PS4,3,506.31,507.51,1.2,3.0,It's kind of the best.
35493,PS4,3,507.51,515.12,7.61,3.0,"It's like, take all the kids to one place like for a time and have them all get the same thing."
35493,PS4,3,515.12,515.36,0.24,3.0,It's like.
35493,PS4,3,515.64,519.28,3.64,1.0,In some countries you have to complete like 2 years of military service.
35493,PS4,3,523.0,523.52,0.52,3.0,Something like that.
35493,PS4,3,523.52,523.68,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,523.68,534.08,10.4,3.0,"So I guess it's not completely infeasible, like maybe it wouldn't work in the biggest country, but you could say like, all right, you have to when you're like 8 years old or whatever."
35493,PS4,3,534.08,553.68,19.6,3.0,"Like, I mean, the the issue is I feel like you kind of have to do that young, but if before there's a chance for people to like become disadvantaged if you then send them or like make them do some standardized thing and then take them from there on merit."
35493,PS4,3,553.68,557.92,4.24,3.0,Like I feel like that's like that makes sense.
35493,PS4,3,560.44,568.68,8.24,3.0,So like mandatory military service but mandatory standardized schooling?
35493,PS4,3,571.08,572.72,1.64,1.0,It sounds like what we're doing right now.
35493,PS4,3,573.32,575.0,1.68,3.0,"I mean, it's like pretty close."
35493,PS4,3,575.0,575.48,0.48,3.0,How is it?
35493,PS4,3,575.48,576.68,1.2,3.0,How is it different?
35493,PS4,3,583.8,589.28,5.48,1.0,So it's basically about whether the government is wanting to do this or not.
35493,PS4,3,589.8,591.68,1.88,1.0,So that's the only problem.
35493,PS4,3,592.04,592.52,0.48,3.0,Yeah.
35493,PS4,3,593.72,596.6,2.88,1.0,"If the government want to do it, then it's mandatory."
35493,PS4,3,596.6,598.44,1.84,1.0,Then everybody gets educated.
35493,PS4,3,599.16,605.96,6.8,1.0,"But if the government says now we don't have any resource for that, and they're not just, they're just, they're not."
35493,PS4,3,605.96,606.12,0.16,3.0,Going.
35493,PS4,3,606.12,614.36,8.24,1.0,"To do it, maybe we stick to the Central as well."
35493,PS4,3,615.08,622.92,7.84,3.0,"OK, so how are, how are, how are we making that creative like national summer camp or something?"
35493,PS4,3,622.92,624.08,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35493,PS4,3,624.08,631.88,7.8,3.0,"Or maybe maybe like maybe like from this, from age, like what?"
35493,PS4,3,631.88,632.88,1.0,3.0,I don't know.
35493,PS4,3,634.36,635.76,1.4,3.0,Let's make it 3 years.
35493,PS4,3,635.76,639.12,3.36,3.0,Like how about four years of like national summer camp?
35493,PS4,3,639.88,640.12,0.24,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35493,PS4,3,640.12,640.92,0.8,3.0,Arbitrary.
35493,PS4,3,641.0,642.48,1.48,3.0,"But what, what ages do you think?"
35493,PS4,3,642.48,644.0,1.52,3.0,Like 8 to 12 or something?
35493,PS4,3,644.0,644.64,0.64,3.0,"OK, Yeah."
35493,PS4,3,646.12,648.12,2.0,1.0,About that primary schools.
35493,PS4,3,650.88,663.44,12.56,3.0,Every student in go to a national schooling summer camp.
35493,PS4,3,665.12,666.32,1.2,3.0,I guess we can make this better.
35493,PS4,3,666.4,695.68,29.28,3.0,"We can say like that starts with standardized testing, then caters to each students weaknesses in a like in a like I want to say standardized but then cater C students weaknesses in the curriculum."
35493,PS4,3,695.84,696.48,0.64,3.0,Uniform.
35493,PS4,3,700.0,716.68,16.68,3.0,"Uniform is to level the field with for dunity, even though that's."
35068,PS1,6,17.48,19.72,2.24,1.0,"Set the rule, the law."
35068,PS1,6,19.72,21.48,1.76,1.0,That is illegal.
35068,PS1,6,28.8,28.92,0.12,1.0,I.
35068,PS1,6,40.52,40.92,0.4,2.0,Think we have?
35068,PS1,6,40.92,42.8,1.88,3.0,To manage.
35068,PS1,6,43.64,44.6,0.96,2.0,Two things The.
35068,PS1,6,44.8,46.44,1.64,3.0,Plastic consumption.
35068,PS1,6,46.76,47.6,0.84,4.0,"Wait, Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
35068,PS1,6,51.08,51.52,0.44,4.0,OK.
35068,PS1,6,51.96,53.88,1.92,2.0,So to frame this is either.
35068,PS1,6,53.88,56.56,2.68,3.0,Manage plastic consumption or plastic production.
35068,PS1,6,56.96,57.52,0.56,2.0,So plastic.
35068,PS1,6,57.52,58.6,1.08,3.0,"Production, usually."
35068,PS1,6,58.6,58.92,0.32,2.0,Is on.
35068,PS1,6,58.92,60.6,1.68,3.0,Manufacturing process blah blah.
35068,PS1,6,60.6,63.96,3.36,2.0,So to one way is to tackle how?
35068,PS1,6,63.96,66.2,2.24,3.0,We can change the production process by.
35068,PS1,6,66.32,67.96,1.64,2.0,Maybe setting up a law to to?
35068,PS1,6,67.96,71.16,3.2,3.0,Make it illegal to use plastic in production process or.
35068,PS1,6,71.56,73.68,2.12,2.0,To encourage people to to go net.
35068,PS1,6,73.68,80.52,6.84,3.0,Zero in carbonization such as like doing carbon credit and stuff to do incentive for.
35068,PS1,6,81.12,84.8,3.68,2.0,"Manufacturer, but on the other side, we also have to."
35068,PS1,6,85.08,92.08,7.0,3.0,"Manage plastic consumption So how can we incentivize people not to use plastic, for example in."
35068,PS1,6,93.76,94.84,1.08,2.0,711 you can see.
35068,PS1,6,94.84,97.68,2.84,3.0,That now they charge people for plastic bags.
35068,PS1,6,98.0,98.68,0.68,2.0,So that's going to be.
35068,PS1,6,98.68,102.84,4.16,3.0,One way to to lessen usage of plastic please in.
35068,PS1,6,102.92,103.36,0.44,2.0,Achieving.
35068,PS1,6,103.36,104.16,0.8,3.0,These two things we.
35068,PS1,6,104.16,104.56,0.4,2.0,Can.
35068,PS1,6,104.96,109.56,4.6,3.0,Manage the consumption process and also production process and plastic.
35068,PS1,6,109.56,110.24,0.68,3.0,Use plastic.
35068,PS1,6,110.24,112.4,2.16,5.0,"Very much like the eye, this guy ask."
35068,PS1,6,115.44,120.96,5.52,1.0,Elon Musk to produce a laser that transform plastic to.
35068,PS1,6,121.36,121.72,0.36,3.0,Sound.
35068,PS1,6,121.72,123.16,1.44,2.0,"Very human, this girl."
35068,PS1,6,124.0,125.68,1.68,4.0,To what not repeat please?
35068,PS1,6,129.08,130.08,1.0,1.0,"Yes, yes, yes."
35068,PS1,6,130.64,133.52,2.88,1.0,Like to make it like.
35068,PS1,6,135.84,143.24,7.4,5.0,"For recycle, I think for the consumption you can come up with like alternative."
35068,PS1,6,144.4,144.72,0.32,2.0,Product.
35068,PS1,6,145.28,147.96,2.68,5.0,"To use as a replacement for plastic as well, but."
35068,PS1,6,149.4,154.4,5.0,1.0,"Actually for some materials we can break another molecule using heat, right?"
35068,PS1,6,154.92,158.76,3.84,1.0,And then we can like combine again and make it a new material.
35068,PS1,6,158.76,159.04,0.28,1.0,So like.
35068,PS1,6,159.36,161.8,2.44,4.0,Change the more regular.
35068,PS1,6,162.48,162.92,0.44,1.0,Structure.
35068,PS1,6,162.92,163.48,0.56,3.0,Technology to.
35068,PS1,6,163.72,163.84,0.12,2.0,Like.
35068,PS1,6,163.92,164.88,0.96,4.0,Of plastic into another.
35068,PS1,6,166.04,168.68,2.64,1.0,Thing that's not.
35068,PS1,6,169.68,169.96,0.28,4.0,Actually.
35068,PS1,6,169.96,170.44,0.48,5.0,Made they?
35068,PS1,6,174.04,177.04,3.0,3.0,Can digest plastic.
35068,PS1,6,177.04,178.56,1.52,4.0,"From now, no technology."
35068,PS1,6,189.12,191.72,2.6,6.0,"Double the price, but also use plastic bags."
35068,PS1,6,192.4,195.4,3.0,4.0,"OK, very high price for the use of plastic and 20."
35068,PS1,6,195.4,196.16,0.76,3.0,Percent.
35068,PS1,6,196.48,197.92,1.44,6.0,"In this car, but also don't use I."
35068,PS1,6,198.36,200.04,1.68,3.0,"Think this one is, yeah."
35068,PS1,6,201.12,209.28,8.16,6.0,"Because like we can't control by setting the law having like decarbonization because it's been ongoing for quite some time and it's not working right, but."
35068,PS1,6,209.88,213.48,3.6,1.0,This one we we have to base everything on like reality or.
35068,PS1,6,214.08,215.8,1.72,6.0,"OK, replicate insects."
35068,PS1,6,225.0,229.16,4.16,2.0,"I don't, I think it has to be very deep because they when they do the test."
35068,PS1,6,229.16,229.48,0.32,3.0,They're going.
35068,PS1,6,229.48,229.88,0.4,2.0,To ask.
35068,PS1,6,229.88,231.36,1.48,3.0,AI to solve this problem.
35068,PS1,6,233.72,234.12,0.4,1.0,He.
35068,PS1,6,235.04,235.36,0.32,2.0,Has a show.
35068,PS1,6,235.56,237.0,1.44,2.0,I think that molecular Dr.
35068,PS1,6,237.0,242.12,5.12,2.0,or even insects is also our sort like probable solutions.
35068,PS1,6,243.0,246.04,3.04,4.0,Can you repeat the insects again?
35068,PS1,6,247.48,248.04,0.56,4.0,Are you sure about?
35068,PS1,6,248.04,248.48,0.44,5.0,Insects.
35068,PS1,6,248.52,249.16,0.64,5.0,"Yeah, there's."
35068,PS1,6,249.32,251.08,1.76,6.0,Like already I think let's be.
35068,PS1,6,251.16,251.64,0.48,4.0,Repeat.
35068,PS1,6,251.64,252.04,0.4,4.0,Repeat.
35068,PS1,6,252.36,261.08,8.72,5.0,They have some like digestive inside in their body that could decompose a signal or two and forward them into like a bodilizer.
35068,PS1,6,262.28,266.36,4.08,6.0,So let's go with this one and then mass produce the insect.
35068,PS1,6,274.04,274.36,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35068,PS1,6,274.68,276.6,1.92,4.0,Use what kind of insect?
35068,PS1,6,277.96,281.16,3.2,5.0,And just say insect like it's a it's a warm actually.
35068,PS1,6,282.24,283.52,1.28,4.0,Use insect.
35068,PS1,6,283.88,285.16,1.28,6.0,Insect species that.
35068,PS1,6,285.76,286.16,0.4,2.0,"OK, I."
35068,PS1,6,286.92,295.12,8.2,5.0,Think we can just match for this 7 minutes?
35068,PS1,6,295.72,296.16,0.44,3.0,"OK, Yeah."
35068,PS1,6,301.08,302.12,1.04,5.0,And it's like AI.
35068,PS1,6,306.8,307.64,0.84,2.0,4.0.
35068,PS1,6,339.96,340.4,0.44,2.0,"No, we."
35068,PS1,6,340.4,341.2,0.8,6.0,Will never know.
35068,PS1,6,342.72,345.2,2.48,6.0,I will cry because I know there is already.
35068,PS1,6,351.52,354.48,2.96,3.0,And then move the insect to destruction part.
35068,PS1,6,354.8,355.0,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35068,PS1,6,357.28,358.6,1.32,4.0,"OK, good idea."
35068,PS1,6,364.64,365.76,1.12,6.0,Is it one idea though?
35068,PS1,6,366.44,366.84,0.4,6.0,We need to.
35068,PS1,6,367.68,369.84,2.16,4.0,"It's like a 1 theme, three ideas, 1 theme."
35068,PS1,6,369.84,370.56,0.72,2.0,Three ideas.
35068,PS1,6,378.32,379.52,1.2,4.0,What do you want to comment?
35068,PS1,6,379.64,380.16,0.52,4.0,Comment.
35068,PS1,6,386.6,387.28,0.68,5.0,Should be.

34483,PS2,3,702.64,705.28,2.64,1.0,"Oh, vulnerability within a supply chain?"
34483,PS2,3,705.88,710.64,4.76,2.0,"Within a supply chain, whatever it is could lead to can control cost in."
34483,PS2,3,711.28,712.8,1.52,1.0,Efficient delivery schedule.
34483,PS2,3,712.8,716.52,3.72,2.0,"Sure, come up with one creative security."

34483,PS2,3,757.48,758.88,1.4,2.0,"But I mean, but it could be."
34483,PS2,3,759.44,764.4,4.96,2.0,"But what I'm saying, yeah, but it could be like instead of having another shape, you could be a rocket."
34483,PS2,3,764.92,767.88,2.96,2.0,"But whatever The thing is, what part of the supply chain are we looking at?"
34483,PS2,3,769.96,772.76,2.8,1.0,Is there any way we can make all of the supply chain?
34483,PS2,3,773.72,775.12,1.4,2.0,Create a transportation machine.
34483,PS2,3,776.68,777.88,1.2,2.0,The transportation machine.
34483,PS2,3,778.48,784.12,5.64,1.0,"But the thing that the supply supply chain is not only about transportation, yes, I know it's about raw material."
34483,PS2,3,784.12,784.96,0.84,1.0,It is about.
34483,PS2,3,785.04,785.36,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, I know."
34483,PS2,3,786.04,788.48,2.44,3.0,It's about electricity.
34483,PS2,3,789.12,789.24,0.12,2.0,It's.
34483,PS2,3,790.92,793.52,2.6,3.0,"About custom, So what?"
34483,PS2,3,797.32,798.88,1.56,1.0,Make everything local.
34483,PS2,3,799.8,800.92,1.12,2.0,But still the same thing.
34483,PS2,3,800.92,802.8,1.88,2.0,"It could be the right, it could be."
34483,PS2,3,802.8,804.6,1.8,2.0,It could be too much traffic.
34483,PS2,3,808.16,810.52,2.36,2.0,That's what part of the play chain.
34483,PS2,3,811.64,814.72,3.08,1.0,"You process everything at home, you just get a lot of different stuff."
34483,PS2,3,814.72,818.0,3.28,1.0,You press a button and then everything you need is there.
34483,PS2,3,818.16,819.88,1.72,2.0,"Yeah, a a Simpsons."
34483,PS2,3,820.0,821.92,1.92,2.0,"No, it's a supersonic stuff thing."
34483,PS2,3,821.96,823.88,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, supersonic, supersonic machine."
34483,PS2,3,824.24,825.56,1.32,2.0,They put a bottom.
34483,PS2,3,825.64,826.56,0.92,2.0,Everything was just made.
34483,PS2,3,826.8,828.04,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, whatever it was, yeah."
34483,PS2,3,828.56,836.4,7.84,3.0,"Or you have like, I don't know, a plant or something which which does everything, but the only thing that goes out is the finished product."
34483,PS2,3,836.4,838.64,2.24,3.0,But actually that would still require raw materials to come in.
34483,PS2,3,838.64,841.0,2.36,3.0,So how about?
34483,PS2,3,841.48,842.24,0.76,2.0,You create an.
34483,PS2,3,842.24,843.68,1.44,3.0,Inventory of two years.
34483,PS2,3,845.68,846.68,1.0,2.0,Security stock.
34483,PS2,3,846.76,850.2,3.44,2.0,Security stock where the why not?
34483,PS2,3,851.08,873.72,22.64,2.0,"Let's go to the most fantastical solution available, which is the place that the supersonic machine and everyone and all they need is a little cube of whatever of all you can do material that you can just store it at home and then you just put it in the machine and it can go past that or it could go medicine."
34483,PS2,3,875.28,877.04,1.76,3.0,Super Sonic material which can do anything.
34483,PS2,3,877.68,878.28,0.6,2.0,That's good benefit.
34483,PS2,3,879.76,882.4,2.64,3.0,"The moment you're about to use it, you somehow program it."
34483,PS2,3,882.72,884.16,1.44,2.0,"You program it, you say, Well, you want."
34483,PS2,3,884.32,884.52,0.2,3.0,It.
34483,PS2,3,885.12,892.44,7.32,2.0,"And then and you put a little cube that can be a small little cube that is, that is the raw material and it can be everything all at once."
34483,PS2,3,900.36,903.76,3.4,1.0,"So everyone has a machine, supersonic machine that you program."
34483,PS2,3,903.76,908.16,4.4,1.0,Pay for the pay for the the finished code.
34483,PS2,3,909.72,912.96,3.24,1.0,"Insert a small cube made of everything material, everything."
34483,PS2,3,913.12,913.92,0.8,2.0,"Material, yeah."
34483,PS2,3,915.48,917.2,1.72,1.0,And then you have.
34483,PS2,3,917.72,918.44,0.72,2.0,Around the machine.
34483,PS2,3,918.92,919.64,0.72,1.0,Whatever.
34483,PS2,3,921.32,922.44,1.12,2.0,"Whatever you want, you need."
34483,PS2,3,923.08,923.88,0.8,1.0,You need what?
34483,PS2,3,924.88,925.4,0.52,2.0,You got it.
34483,PS2,3,925.72,930.44,4.72,2.0,"Yeah, It can give you a laptop or it can give you a bowl of pasta, whatever."
34483,PS2,3,930.44,937.6,7.16,1.0,"Yeah, from a laptop to a bowl of pasta."
34483,PS2,3,938.96,951.08,12.12,1.0,"The the only the only issue is getting this everything material to our house, but since it's something that it's small and storable, you can have a lot of."
34483,PS2,3,951.16,955.16,4.0,2.0,Those you can stop from disruptions when the disruption happens.
34483,PS2,3,955.52,956.44,0.92,1.0,And there's I.
34483,PS2,3,956.44,957.84,1.4,3.0,Know you're supposed to have that.
34483,PS2,3,958.12,961.32,3.2,2.0,"Yeah, and it can only be used but during times of crisis."
34483,PS2,3,961.32,961.64,0.32,2.0,Exactly.
34483,PS2,3,962.6,966.0,3.4,3.0,"Those have to be activated by the government, so it's like a dead material until."
34483,PS2,3,967.52,969.64,2.12,2.0,"Yeah, that's that's it."
34483,PS2,3,970.68,971.64,0.96,1.0,Are then like.
34483,PS2,3,971.76,976.56,4.8,1.0,The other problem is getting like machines.
34483,PS2,3,976.72,979.16,2.44,1.0,"If they they broke down, how do you fix that?"
34483,PS2,3,979.16,980.2,1.04,1.0,But then I think it's not a.
34483,PS2,3,980.2,981.12,0.92,3.0,Supply chain it's.
34483,PS2,3,981.16,982.24,1.08,2.0,"Not a supply chain, Yeah."
34483,PS2,3,984.04,988.52,4.48,2.0,"And if you yeah, if it's broken, you just create another machine from the machine with the everything materials."
34483,PS2,3,989.16,989.84,0.68,3.0,Never breaks down.
34483,PS2,3,1008.24,1010.8,2.56,1.0,"OK, good, good."

35229,PS5,3,26.92,29.52,2.6,1.0,"I mean, you know, money is probably a very good reason."
35229,PS5,3,31.04,31.96,0.92,2.0,"Culture, probably."
35229,PS5,3,32.52,32.88,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35229,PS5,3,32.88,33.64,0.76,2.0,Benefits.

35229,PS5,3,43.08,49.24,6.16,1.0,"But yeah, let's if everything else is ideal, like everyone's staying with you, then probably money dominates as a factor."
35229,PS5,3,49.56,51.04,1.48,3.0,Money and other benefits.
35229,PS5,3,51.08,51.2,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35229,PS5,3,52.68,53.68,1.0,2.0,Is that crazy for the other?
35229,PS5,3,56.0,65.16,9.16,1.0,This create so 1 is you can make the experience of working there better maybe.
35229,PS5,3,65.6,67.0,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, create the officers."
35229,PS5,3,67.0,70.12,3.12,2.0,Create some sense of belonging.
35229,PS5,3,70.2,73.2,3.0,2.0,Probably because then it's harder to leave if you like the people.
35229,PS5,3,73.36,75.96,2.6,2.0,"Yeah, like the people."
35229,PS5,3,75.96,78.88,2.92,2.0,"Then even if you get some more money, sometimes you don't want to switch."
35229,PS5,3,79.2,79.4,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35229,PS5,3,82.08,90.44,8.36,1.0,This is the whole the environment all the way from like how the building like all the facilities are inside world and the and the people as well.
35229,PS5,3,90.48,93.0,2.52,1.0,"Yeah, maybe like have more activities at the office."

35229,PS5,3,102.84,106.0,3.16,1.0,Probably like a cricket society or something.
35229,PS5,3,109.12,110.84,1.72,3.0,"I think some companies have that though, like."
35229,PS5,3,111.8,112.24,0.44,1.0,But like.
35229,PS5,3,112.28,114.04,1.76,3.0,Like special special interest.
35229,PS5,3,114.44,120.68,6.24,1.0,"Groups, but usually how seen it work, maybe I'm wrong, is just they'll be like, oh, we're playing against that branch in like a week."
35229,PS5,3,120.68,123.2,2.52,1.0,Let's go and practice like once or twice and then it's done.
35229,PS5,3,123.24,126.4,3.16,1.0,"It's not like a, you know, an active thing."
35229,PS5,3,126.44,129.08,2.64,1.0,"It's just something's coming up, so let's make a team and do it."
35229,PS5,3,130.32,132.72,2.4,1.0,So maybe like that could be another incentive.
35229,PS5,3,141.8,148.4,6.6,1.0,"I guess you have points with money, We have office culture."
35229,PS5,3,149.32,152.64,3.32,2.0,You can sign a contract prohibiting someone to switch to the competitive.
35229,PS5,3,154.0,154.72,0.72,3.0,That's creative.
35229,PS5,3,156.2,156.6,0.4,1.0,Just like.
35229,PS5,3,156.72,157.56,0.84,3.0,"You, you can't."

35229,PS5,3,165.72,166.92,1.2,3.0,Contract that is creative.
35229,PS5,3,168.8,170.92,2.12,1.0,Then they can only leave when you want them to.
35229,PS5,3,172.92,173.92,1.0,1.0,I don't know like how it's a.
35229,PS5,3,173.96,179.8,5.84,2.0,"Bit no, no, it's like you cannot do that like legally, but you can say here they cannot work in the competitors."
35229,PS5,3,179.8,182.28,2.48,2.0,"So they, like you, don't really have a place to live."
35229,PS5,3,182.48,182.76,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35229,PS5,3,183.68,184.68,1.0,2.0,Especially if you like a.
35229,PS5,3,184.68,185.32,0.64,1.0,Specialized.
35229,PS5,3,185.32,188.72,3.4,1.0,"So if you're like working the software industry, that's it."
35229,PS5,3,189.04,191.16,2.12,1.0,Can't work on this kind of software anyone.
35229,PS5,3,191.16,193.28,2.12,1.0,That's what you've been doing for the last four years and you're dead.
35229,PS5,3,194.76,195.16,0.4,1.0,Why not?
35229,PS5,3,201.04,201.16,0.12,1.0,OK.
35229,PS5,3,201.16,214.44,13.28,1.0,"So we have you have you slide with the contract money, corporate culture, OK, culture then money and benefits, OK."
35229,PS5,3,218.48,230.88,12.4,3.0,"Or like, if you want to leave, then then you have to convince like a majority of the company that that, that it's like, OK, they'll let you leave you."
35229,PS5,3,232.16,232.84,0.68,2.0,Cannot do that.
35229,PS5,3,233.28,234.16,0.88,3.0,Then then you just stay.
35229,PS5,3,234.24,235.64,1.4,1.0,You have to find your own replacement.
35229,PS5,3,235.68,238.76,3.08,1.0,You have to find your own replacement.
35229,PS5,3,240.52,246.36,5.84,1.0,"Yeah, you hire somebody for your own position again, but then you hire something."
35229,PS5,3,247.2,248.2,1.0,3.0,I think people will want.
35229,PS5,3,248.2,255.08,6.88,2.0,"To you cannot make people do that because like, like legally they can just leave the work if they want."
35229,PS5,3,255.68,256.16,0.48,2.0,Have somebody.
35229,PS5,3,256.28,259.88,3.6,1.0,"Trying to be creative, yeah."
35229,PS5,3,259.88,261.04,1.16,1.0,Like in an environment it.
35229,PS5,3,261.16,262.44,1.28,2.0,Would force people to work.
35229,PS5,3,262.44,266.04,3.6,1.0,With the question says that resulting in the reduction of value of talent.
35229,PS5,3,266.04,270.0,3.96,1.0,So you have to like 1 is that you make sure that that reduction doesn't happen.
35229,PS5,3,272.56,277.56,5.0,2.0,"Yeah, I would probably focus on the how to just."
35229,PS5,3,277.92,279.04,1.12,2.0,"OK, how to just?"
35229,PS5,3,280.2,280.36,0.16,3.0,So.
35229,PS5,3,280.4,282.2,1.8,2.0,Keep people staying.
35229,PS5,3,290.72,291.32,0.6,2.0,Give free food.
35229,PS5,3,292.12,294.28,2.16,1.0,"Yeah, Oh my God, that's actually a really."
35229,PS5,3,294.28,295.88,1.6,2.0,"Good one, yeah, but Oh yeah."
35229,PS5,3,295.88,296.0,0.12,2.0,But.
35229,PS5,3,296.0,303.48,7.48,1.0,"Give free means free because if you're living without your family or like you're like a student who just graduated, I get breakfast, lunch and dinner free."
35229,PS5,3,303.84,304.4,0.56,1.0,I'm taking it.
35229,PS5,3,305.4,306.24,0.84,1.0,This makes my life.
35229,PS5,3,306.48,308.56,2.08,3.0,"Oh, or like food and accommodations."
35229,PS5,3,308.56,310.32,1.76,3.0,"And if you leave, you just like, take it back, yeah."
35229,PS5,3,310.32,313.12,2.8,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, I mean, I cried."
35229,PS5,3,314.52,316.68,2.16,1.0,Imagine having to find housing in London.
35229,PS5,3,317.28,317.48,0.2,1.0,Yeah.

35229,PS5,3,321.8,323.68,1.88,3.0,Or do you still want to go with the contract thing?
35229,PS5,3,323.84,325.96,2.12,1.0,"No, right, everything, everything."
35229,PS5,3,325.96,327.24,1.28,1.0,It's mentioned like 1 incentive.
35229,PS5,3,327.8,328.28,0.48,3.0,We what?
35229,PS5,3,328.92,330.08,1.16,1.0,Maybe first one's like money.
35229,PS5,3,330.44,331.72,1.28,1.0,Usually that's the point.
35229,PS5,3,332.08,333.88,1.8,3.0,We is it right?
35229,PS5,3,333.88,334.32,0.44,3.0,Everything.
35229,PS5,3,334.36,335.08,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, like all the."
35229,PS5,3,335.28,335.6,0.32,3.0,Points.
35229,PS5,3,335.68,336.56,0.88,3.0,Here's the one idea though.
35229,PS5,3,337.44,338.8,1.36,1.0,It's come with one creative idea.
35229,PS5,3,338.8,340.88,2.08,1.0,"Yeah, oops, sorry, I didn't."
35229,PS5,3,341.84,342.24,0.4,1.0,I missed that.
35229,PS5,3,345.92,346.32,0.4,1.0,So we can.
35229,PS5,3,352.44,354.44,2.0,3.0,I think the food and housing 1 might be.
35229,PS5,3,355.56,355.76,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35229,PS5,3,355.88,357.44,1.56,1.0,"Well, benefits basically, Yeah."
35229,PS5,3,357.6,365.16,7.56,1.0,"Like food, housing, transport, family relocation, maybe holidays."
35229,PS5,3,401.31,406.47,5.16,1.0,I've paid vacation instead set a.
35229,PS5,3,406.47,413.79,7.32,2.0,Father there.
35229,PS5,3,418.64,456.36,37.72,1.0,"OK, that's that's very subjective foods in which religion if you go to Iran and probably do that, I don't think they really care then they will be taking away and they decide to leave the company everything they lose access to these access to these facilities and there's a full stop."
35229,PS5,3,457.16,459.32,2.16,1.0,So these act as an incentive.
35229,PS5,3,460.28,473.76,13.48,1.0,These act as an incentive to retain the to retain to what to retain RETA like retain retain TAIM.
35229,PS5,3,474.0,474.8,0.8,3.0,Or retain.
35229,PS5,3,474.8,476.12,1.32,3.0,"OK, OK, OK, OK."
35229,PS5,3,476.12,476.44,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, retain."
35229,PS5,3,483.2,483.56,0.36,1.0,OK.
35229,PS5,3,497.48,498.0,0.52,1.0,"Oh, that's it."
35229,PS5,3,498.0,498.24,0.24,1.0,I guess.
35229,PS5,3,498.4,499.72,1.32,1.0,Let me move to the next question.
34570,PS3,3,0.0,347.8,0.88,2.0,Imagine.
34570,PS3,3,347.8,348.68,0.88,2.0,Are you serious?
34570,PS3,3,350.72,351.24,0.52,2.0,Reduce.
34570,PS3,3,351.24,352.08,0.84,2.0,It's spread.
34570,PS3,3,352.68,353.64,0.96,2.0,Shut up people's mouths.
34570,PS3,3,354.88,359.52,4.64,1.0,"Make you sneeze and then no, you're just gonna amplify the spread."
34570,PS3,3,360.48,364.28,3.8,3.0,"Just make people not able to hear, yeah."
34570,PS3,3,365.08,366.88,1.8,2.0,So you can't speak or you can't hear?
34570,PS3,3,366.88,367.32,0.44,2.0,What if you do?
34570,PS3,3,367.44,370.92,3.48,1.0,This or like you do a hand action that doesn't involve like.
34570,PS3,3,370.92,373.96,3.04,2.0,"Oh, doesn't it involve opening your mouth to say sorry?"
34570,PS3,3,374.64,378.52,3.88,2.0,Or you wake or you create.
34570,PS3,3,378.72,384.44,5.72,3.0,Or you just have it be really loud all the time everywhere you like set up speakers.
34570,PS3,3,384.44,385.68,1.24,3.0,"It's like, really?"
34570,PS3,3,385.68,386.36,0.68,2.0,Really loud I think.
34570,PS3,3,386.6,387.44,0.84,3.0,So no one can hear.
34570,PS3,3,387.68,392.68,5.0,2.0,Anything or you already create the antidote before for sorry.
34570,PS3,3,392.68,395.2,2.52,2.0,Like it's antidote for sorry.
34570,PS3,3,395.28,403.08,7.8,2.0,"Like if sorry is the virus, you create an antidote for the virus, which is it's OK before it starts to spread."
34570,PS3,3,403.16,404.92,1.76,2.0,So it's in a controlled environment.
34570,PS3,3,406.52,409.72,3.2,2.0,"Yeah, but I like the speaker idea."
34570,PS3,3,410.32,411.92,1.6,2.0,"If no one can hear, it'll never spread."
34570,PS3,3,414.12,414.8,0.68,2.0,But that no.
34570,PS3,3,414.8,416.08,1.28,1.0,One can hear anything else as well.
34570,PS3,3,416.08,419.32,3.24,2.0,Exactly so it comes with so collateral damage.
34570,PS3,3,419.8,420.84,1.04,2.0,I like the antidote.
34570,PS3,3,422.08,426.36,4.28,1.0,"So the antidote, what you're saying is it's OK, it's."
34570,PS3,3,426.36,427.2,0.84,2.0,The word it's OK.
34570,PS3,3,427.96,429.6,1.64,1.0,"So every time someone says sorry, you have to."
34570,PS3,3,429.64,432.28,2.64,2.0,"Before they say yeah, before there's complete sorry say."
34570,PS3,3,432.44,432.84,0.4,1.0,It's OK.
34570,PS3,3,433.56,434.08,0.52,1.0,Wow.
34570,PS3,3,434.24,435.88,1.64,1.0,That's relying a lot on reflexes.
34570,PS3,3,435.88,438.64,2.76,1.0,"Like, yes, sorry, See, you didn't say it's OK, Sorry."
34570,PS3,3,441.8,442.16,0.36,3.0,"No, no."
34570,PS3,3,442.2,444.04,1.84,3.0,But it could be after and it just.
34570,PS3,3,444.08,444.56,0.48,2.0,Cancels.
34570,PS3,3,444.64,445.6,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, cancels."
34570,PS3,3,445.84,447.48,1.64,1.0,"Like snake venom, like you just."
34570,PS3,3,447.48,447.92,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
34570,PS3,3,448.88,451.04,2.16,2.0,"Like immediately, like you should have the candidate."
34570,PS3,3,451.16,457.36,6.2,2.0,"It's OK, you know, before you say sorry or what if you what if sorry is just not allowed to be said?"
34570,PS3,3,457.64,458.24,0.6,2.0,How do you not?
34570,PS3,3,458.32,458.64,0.32,1.0,Allowed.
34570,PS3,3,459.64,460.04,0.4,1.0,"No, but."
34570,PS3,3,460.04,464.28,4.24,2.0,You spread information about like sorry is not a part of the literary anymore.
34570,PS3,3,464.28,467.92,3.64,2.0,It's like how we ruled out Pluto from the solar system it took.
34570,PS3,3,467.92,470.16,2.24,1.0,"Months and years By then, the pandemic will kill the."
34570,PS3,3,470.16,470.36,0.2,2.0,World.
34570,PS3,3,470.36,471.68,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, but it's not started now."
34570,PS3,3,472.24,473.68,1.44,2.0,How does it say it's imagined has?
34570,PS3,3,473.92,474.6,0.68,1.0,Emerged and.
34570,PS3,3,478.16,479.04,0.88,2.0,That means we have to.
34570,PS3,3,479.04,482.64,3.6,3.0,"Start You already tried to tell women to stop saying sorry, but it has."
34570,PS3,3,483.56,484.12,0.56,2.0,Exactly.
34570,PS3,3,484.2,484.48,0.28,2.0,I don't.
34570,PS3,3,485.44,485.6,0.16,3.0,Think.
34570,PS3,3,488.2,493.24,5.04,1.0,"Oh, you inject someone with like everyone with a mutation that just makes them completely unapologetic."
34570,PS3,3,493.96,494.4,0.44,1.0,Nobody say.
34570,PS3,3,494.76,494.92,0.16,2.0,Sorry.
34570,PS3,3,494.92,495.8,0.88,2.0,Sometimes I love that.
34570,PS3,3,495.8,496.12,0.32,2.0,I love that.
34570,PS3,3,496.12,496.24,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS3,3,499.04,499.36,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS3,3,499.36,503.88,4.52,2.0,"A bunch of testosterone where you're just like I Yeah, You, you all."
34570,PS3,3,505.04,505.4,0.36,3.0,Transition.
34570,PS3,3,506.24,506.48,0.24,2.0,You.
34570,PS3,3,506.48,514.92,8.44,2.0,"Yeah, all of us have been injected with a bunch of testosterone where you have the ego of an average male."
34570,PS3,3,515.16,515.8,0.64,2.0,Male.
34570,PS3,3,515.8,517.64,1.84,2.0,"I was gonna say white man, but whatever."
34570,PS3,3,520.0,521.04,1.04,3.0,Let me overcome White.
34570,PS3,3,521.4,521.52,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS3,3,522.6,526.96,4.36,1.0,The world will be non pandemic free but very unpleasant.
34570,PS3,3,527.0,528.56,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, my unpleasant very only."
34570,PS3,3,528.56,529.72,1.16,1.0,Solving one problem right?
34570,PS3,3,529.76,530.28,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34570,PS3,3,530.28,531.0,0.72,2.0,It's just that.
34570,PS3,3,531.24,539.2,7.96,2.0,"So I think the like you have to, yeah, I think the injection bit is better than having an antidote because you can't drive around people with like an."
34570,PS3,3,539.2,539.52,0.32,1.0,Antidote.
34570,PS3,3,539.52,539.84,0.32,1.0,It's better.
34570,PS3,3,540.08,540.68,0.6,2.0,Than cure.
34570,PS3,3,540.68,541.24,0.56,2.0,Exactly.
34570,PS3,3,541.24,542.0,0.76,2.0,Prevention is better.
34570,PS3,3,542.52,544.48,1.96,2.0,Just sorry shouldn't make any sense to them.
34570,PS3,3,544.76,549.36,4.6,2.0,"So either you rule out the word sorry, or you just reprogram the brain that sorry doesn't exist."
34570,PS3,3,551.32,556.32,5.0,1.0,"So either you can reprogram the brain such that sorry, doesn't exist but they're still nice people, or you just like."
34570,PS3,3,557.24,558.64,1.4,2.0,You give them.
34570,PS3,3,558.64,561.32,2.68,1.0,"Testosterone, it's like they know it exists, but they'll never say."
34570,PS3,3,561.36,561.96,0.6,3.0,It say it.
34570,PS3,3,562.08,562.4,0.32,2.0,Correct.
34570,PS3,3,562.6,563.2,0.6,1.0,Whichever.
34570,PS3,3,564.84,565.96,1.12,2.0,"Yeah, I like that."
34570,PS3,3,566.48,567.76,1.28,1.0,So which which way are we going to?
34570,PS3,3,567.76,567.92,0.16,2.0,Both.
34570,PS3,3,567.96,568.72,0.76,2.0,You have to say both.
34570,PS3,3,571.6,573.36,1.76,2.0,"You would initially, I think."
34570,PS3,3,575.24,577.84,2.6,2.0,"Yeah, you would inject all the humans with the."
34570,PS3,3,577.84,581.16,3.32,2.0,We call it not antidote.
34570,PS3,3,581.16,581.92,0.76,2.0,It's like virus.
34570,PS3,3,586.12,587.16,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, clear."
34570,PS3,3,587.44,588.44,1.0,1.0,Like what do you call it?
34570,PS3,3,588.44,588.88,0.44,1.0,The thing?
34570,PS3,3,588.88,590.0,1.12,1.0,What do you inject in people?
34570,PS3,3,590.48,591.04,0.56,2.0,Vaccine.
34570,PS3,3,591.04,598.44,7.4,2.0,"Yeah, inject humans with a vaccine that hinders them from apologizing."
34570,PS3,3,599.76,606.28,6.52,2.0,"And if that were to not work, then we reprogram the brain."
34570,PS3,3,611.44,621.72,10.28,2.0,"Else reprogram the brain to remove the word sorry from their, Yeah, their dictionary."
34570,PS3,3,621.76,623.92,2.16,2.0,Like their vocabulary correct?
34570,PS3,3,626.2,627.92,1.72,1.0,That hinders them from apologizing.
34570,PS3,3,627.92,633.04,5.12,1.0,I think this doesn't capture the whole idea that we had where they that's very.
34570,PS3,3,634.12,634.76,0.64,3.0,I'm OK.
34570,PS3,3,635.08,636.28,1.2,1.0,"I'm OK, I don't need to."
34570,PS3,3,636.44,636.84,0.4,2.0,Apologize.
34570,PS3,3,637.04,643.4,6.36,2.0,"Yeah, so you inject you into the vaccine that hinders them from apologizing and that and makes them believe that their."
34570,PS3,3,644.32,648.28,3.96,1.0,Bacteria mimicking.
34570,PS3,3,649.48,649.64,0.16,2.0,An.
34570,PS3,3,649.64,654.56,4.92,1.0,Extreme version of of the male ego the.
34570,PS3,3,655.68,657.64,1.96,2.0,Male ego and self centeredness.
34570,PS3,3,659.44,661.44,2.0,1.0,I think male ego is self-explanatory.
34570,PS3,3,661.68,664.68,3.0,2.0,Which hinders they would know it's three women writing there.
34570,PS3,3,666.76,667.48,0.72,1.0,They were audio.
34570,PS3,3,668.2,672.48,4.28,2.0,Which hinders them from apologizing as reprogram the brain to remove soil from vocabulary.
34570,PS3,3,672.48,677.88,5.4,2.0,"Yeah, I like that better because reprogram is probably easier than banning, but reprogramming is."
34570,PS3,3,677.88,680.0,2.12,2.0,It's also harder to how to establish.
34570,PS3,3,680.0,680.48,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, how?"

36234,PS4,3,0.4,0.8,0.4,1.0,OK.
36234,PS4,3,4.72,5.6,0.88,2.0,Education in quality.
36234,PS4,3,5.6,14.6,9.0,2.0,It's the unequal distribution to overcome inequality in education.
36234,PS4,3,17.16,18.6,1.44,2.0,Why is the vibe so different?
36234,PS4,3,18.6,20.36,1.76,2.0,I know the last one was so unhinged.
36234,PS4,3,20.36,21.16,0.8,2.0,This one's so serious.
36234,PS4,3,29.04,29.56,0.52,1.0,OK.
36234,PS4,3,30.72,38.68,7.96,1.0,"I mean, what do we think that like, like what do you think causes the unequal distribution of academic resources?"
36234,PS4,3,38.68,53.04,14.36,1.0,"Like, like do you think it's something in like assessment or like, you know, like the structure, the system, or is it like a specific policy?"
36234,PS4,3,64.48,65.88,1.4,2.0,"I think there's certainly a lot there, right?"
36234,PS4,3,65.88,76.8,10.92,2.0,"Like this, this is sort of like historical stuff, like a long line of history of how resources are distributed that are just not even like settled or redistributed even at the same."
36234,PS4,3,76.92,77.16,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36234,PS4,3,79.28,84.48,5.2,1.0,"And like, I guess a good place to start is what kind of academic resources are we going to?"
36234,PS4,3,84.6,84.92,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
36234,PS4,3,85.36,86.44,1.08,1.0,Going to target right?
36234,PS4,3,86.64,86.88,0.24,1.0,Like.
36234,PS4,3,94.08,114.68,20.6,1.0,"Because it could be things like, I don't know, access to tuition or like, I don't know, say like the context of like Oxbridge, like improving, like how well prepared you are for university prep, like university applications, especially to more selected places like Oxbridge."
36234,PS4,3,114.68,119.48,4.8,1.0,And this is hard.
36234,PS4,3,124.92,127.32,2.4,2.0,How come let's focus on that.
36234,PS4,3,127.32,132.32,5.0,2.0,Like we like access to to schools like like me.
36234,PS4,3,132.32,138.92,6.6,2.0,"Do you want to focus on like more prestigious schooling in general or do you want to go to like, you know, like like the more selective ones?"
36234,PS4,3,138.92,141.44,2.52,2.0,And then like which access are we do we want to focus on?
36234,PS4,3,141.44,142.92,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, that's a good question."
36234,PS4,3,144.32,144.96,0.64,2.0,Which one do we have?
36234,PS4,3,144.96,145.68,0.72,2.0,Ideas.
36234,PS4,3,147.56,167.2,19.64,1.0,"I mean, we could start with like, The thing is maybe tutoring like we might be cover like improving access to like tutoring instead of like improving accessibility to Oxbridge because, you know, not everybody wants to apply, not everybody wants to go to Oxbridge, for example."
36234,PS4,3,167.84,177.56,9.72,1.0,"So I guess we could focus on, yeah, like improving academic access to like support for academic performance, I guess."
36234,PS4,3,179.0,183.56,4.56,1.0,"And what should we, what should we do to improve that?"
36234,PS4,3,221.04,226.68,5.64,3.0,"So I think, I think that you were talking about what should we focus on earlier."
36234,PS4,3,226.68,232.84,6.16,3.0,So I think we're essentially talking about disadvantaged in nationalized groups.
36234,PS4,3,233.6,240.36,6.76,3.0,"First of all, we have to think about inclusivity and maybe some policies related to that."
36234,PS4,3,245.16,249.64,4.48,3.0,"Of course, that should also contain the support as you said."
36234,PS4,3,254.64,261.44,6.8,2.0,"So like I just say like inclusive policies that promote inquisitivity, right?"
36234,PS4,3,263.48,274.68,11.2,2.0,And then this would be how would that look like policy or promote inquisitivity as in like in by ways?
36234,PS4,3,275.24,293.72,18.48,1.0,"Like I want to say like increasing funding in like disadvantaged areas for for example, like introducing tutors in like starting a tutoring program in disadvantaged areas."
36234,PS4,3,304.4,305.04,0.64,2.0,Like tutoring?
36234,PS4,3,305.76,307.12,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, tutoring programs."
36234,PS4,3,307.68,309.72,2.04,1.0,Subsidized tutoring programs.
36234,PS4,3,312.8,334.67,21.87,2.0,"For, oh, I have an idea, I feel like a big part of it."
36234,PS4,3,334.83,337.19,2.36,2.0,Could it be that like they just don't see themselves in it?
36234,PS4,3,337.55,339.31,1.76,2.0,"As in like it's a psychological thing, right?"
36234,PS4,3,339.31,343.59,4.28,2.0,And it's a sort of like psychological self-image sort of barrier.
36234,PS4,3,343.67,344.63,0.96,1.0,True could.
36234,PS4,3,344.63,348.92,4.29,2.0,It be that so I feel like it's the idea that and how can we dismantle that?
36234,PS4,3,348.92,349.56,0.64,2.0,Let me think.
36234,PS4,3,353.64,359.36,5.72,2.0,I think I did Telling stories is an important part.
36234,PS4,3,359.36,371.68,12.32,2.0,"So like, like sharings about students, like, you know, like find like successful stories of students."
36234,PS4,3,372.52,382.36,9.84,1.0,Would that be like in increasing like awareness of like role models from these groups or like a mentoring service?
36234,PS4,3,382.64,383.52,0.88,2.0,I feel like it can be both.
36234,PS4,3,384.12,384.56,0.44,1.0,Right.
36234,PS4,3,384.68,384.92,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36234,PS4,3,384.92,386.56,1.64,2.0,It can awareness of.
36234,PS4,3,388.68,394.6,5.92,1.0,Role models from like from disadvantaged slash marginalized backgrounds.
36234,PS4,3,402.36,404.12,1.76,2.0,Of role models from disadvantage.
36234,PS4,3,407.2,408.56,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, like mentoring, right?"
36234,PS4,3,408.92,411.84,2.92,2.0,"Yeah, I do."
36234,PS4,3,411.88,414.48,2.6,2.0,I think we can add here like mentoring.
36234,PS4,3,414.56,415.08,0.52,1.0,"Programs, yeah."
36234,PS4,3,416.44,417.36,0.92,2.0,Let's do one more.
36234,PS4,3,417.56,418.44,0.88,2.0,3 is a good number.
36234,PS4,3,420.96,421.48,0.52,2.0,You have one more.
36234,PS4,3,424.96,425.68,0.72,1.0,Therapy I.
36234,PS4,3,426.6,427.8,1.2,2.0,Don't know therapy?
36234,PS4,3,427.8,434.8,7.0,1.0,Right for for empowerment.
36234,PS4,3,435.36,436.24,0.88,2.0,Therapy I.
36234,PS4,3,439.92,442.6,2.68,1.0,Don't know what do you what do you think I'm just.
36234,PS4,3,442.6,443.08,0.48,2.0,What have we?
36234,PS4,3,443.08,443.8,0.72,2.0,What have we?
36234,PS4,3,459.76,461.28,1.52,2.0,Or should we just go with the first two?
36234,PS4,3,461.92,462.4,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, I don't."
36234,PS4,3,462.72,463.52,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, sure, increase."
36234,PS4,3,464.36,464.6,0.24,3.0,Funds.
36234,PS4,3,465.6,466.32,0.72,2.0,"Yeah, sorry."
36234,PS4,3,467.04,467.56,0.52,3.0,Increase funds.
36234,PS4,3,469.0,470.04,1.04,1.0,"Funding, funding."
36234,PS4,3,471.16,471.64,0.48,2.0,"OK, you."
36234,PS4,3,472.68,476.32,3.64,3.0,Know marginalized groups have access of type into.
36234,PS4,3,483.24,485.16,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, let's do that, yeah."
35922,PS4,3,3.48,4.4,0.92,1.0,"Oh, we have to write it."
35922,PS4,3,16.41,17.25,0.84,2.0,For your PhD.
35922,PS4,3,18.21,23.09,4.88,1.0,"In education, great, leave it up to you."
35922,PS4,3,24.85,33.37,8.52,3.0,"So if we are working against AI, so AI is always good and."
35922,PS4,3,35.28,35.4,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35922,PS4,3,40.0,49.48,9.48,3.0,So I think if we look into this education inequality and is it's hard about unequal distribution of chemical resources.
35922,PS4,3,50.64,59.76,9.12,3.0,"So to welcome like this inequality, so sorry."
35922,PS4,3,59.96,63.28,3.32,3.0,"So instead of going from my side, so you just share and then."
35922,PS4,3,63.56,64.04,0.48,2.0,"No, no, sorry."
35922,PS4,3,64.04,66.04,2.0,2.0,Like I need some other thing.
35922,PS4,3,66.52,66.92,0.4,3.0,"OK, so."
35922,PS4,3,67.56,70.16,2.6,1.0,You can you can start us with a base and then you can build on.
35922,PS4,3,70.16,75.24,5.08,3.0,"It yeah, yeah, exactly that's what I want is you have the idea otherwise I will influence."
35922,PS4,3,82.84,100.84,18.0,1.0,"I mean, when it comes to distribution of academic resources, it's a, it's more of a macro issue I think because it talks about, I mean the general population as a whole."
35922,PS4,3,103.08,129.96,26.88,1.0,"And I'm just starting with the basic idea would be to, so I used to work with a nonprofit organization and we did skips in rural areas to help with this inequality."
35922,PS4,3,129.96,138.48,8.52,1.0,And we used to donate books and we would get sponsors to get them laptops and stuff and teach them how to use them.
35922,PS4,3,141.68,148.52,6.84,1.0,We would also give them story books instead of actual like economics or mathematics like subject books.
35922,PS4,3,148.52,156.28,7.76,1.0,So just to start them off easy and then we would care and just we would then distribute like actual subjects.
35922,PS4,3,156.28,156.64,0.36,3.0,Books.
35922,PS4,3,159.0,159.44,0.44,3.0,OK.
35922,PS4,3,163.96,176.96,13.0,2.0,"So essentially I was thinking along the lines of, you know, of maybe systems like UKUEU and stuff where school teaching and schools are governed by the government."
35922,PS4,3,177.28,182.08,4.8,2.0,"So and teachers usually have like a set salary, they're employed by the government."
35922,PS4,3,182.36,190.72,8.36,2.0,"So what if because a teacher can make or break the education that you could have the best textbooks, best access, best resources, best databases."
35922,PS4,3,191.04,197.16,6.12,2.0,"But if a teacher is not there to treat your format of mind in the right way, you it might break up make or break situation."
35922,PS4,3,197.16,203.68,6.52,2.0,So the best teachers you love often find at schools that eat and Harrow and other private schools because they're paid more.
35922,PS4,3,203.92,210.72,6.8,2.0,So what if teaching and profession move to like more like medical thing as in where the after your degree you're forced.
35922,PS4,3,210.92,219.92,9.0,2.0,"Like you have to do 2 years of service in some in maybe a sixth form school up north in England for example, or somewhere where they're not enough resources."
35922,PS4,3,219.92,226.2,6.28,2.0,"So each good teacher who get tech, every teacher goes to the system keeps going to other schools as a mandatory service."
35922,PS4,3,226.2,235.2,9.0,2.0,So they keep getting good teachers and the maybe when that happens like schools won't be divided based on the concentration of good teachers.
35922,PS4,3,235.2,240.96,5.76,2.0,Maybe in England it is such that the South part southern part of England are usually has better grammar school by the teachers.
35922,PS4,3,241.12,242.24,1.12,2.0,The northern part has the worst.
35922,PS4,3,242.24,245.68,3.44,2.0,So if you could do like 2 years of compulsory service there.
35922,PS4,3,246.72,246.84,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35922,PS4,3,248.92,250.52,1.6,1.0,Like non profit but as a part of their.
35922,PS4,3,250.72,253.12,2.4,2.0,"Yeah, like how doctors have to do it."
35922,PS4,3,253.12,253.36,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35922,PS4,3,254.44,257.84,3.4,2.0,Because at the end of the it's a service which is provided by the government.
35922,PS4,3,261.4,264.56,3.16,3.0,So are we supposed to write there as well?
35922,PS4,3,264.56,264.68,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35922,PS4,3,264.68,264.88,0.2,1.0,I think.
35922,PS4,3,265.32,269.08,3.76,2.0,"I have to just write that, and we don't have to write like we have to."
35922,PS4,3,269.08,270.64,1.56,2.0,We can discuss here as ideas.
35922,PS4,3,271.12,272.64,1.52,3.0,"And we don't have to write, right?"
35922,PS4,3,272.68,273.36,0.68,1.0,"No, we have to write."
35922,PS4,3,273.56,275.04,1.48,2.0,There we have to type it there and enter.
35922,PS4,3,276.84,277.16,0.32,3.0,OK.
35922,PS4,3,277.76,278.16,0.4,2.0,So I think.
35922,PS4,3,279.56,279.96,0.4,1.0,"No, it's."
35922,PS4,3,281.76,282.76,1.0,2.0,I think it should move one chair.
35922,PS4,3,282.76,309.04,26.28,3.0,"You can type, you can, you can just so I think building on you both ideas, so you are proposing to have like equitable access to resources for the students, especially those are who are marginalized and disadvantaged location different under privileged areas."
35922,PS4,3,309.68,313.48,3.8,3.0,So that would help to overcome like the inequality.
35922,PS4,3,314.56,323.08,8.52,3.0,"So that's that one of like and under the resources, we can categorize physical resources, infrastructure resources, human resources, right."
35922,PS4,3,323.64,328.24,4.6,3.0,"So infrastructure related, what we can gap, learning resources, what we can gap."
35922,PS4,3,328.68,330.28,1.6,3.0,And the third is human resources.
35922,PS4,3,330.28,339.8,9.52,3.0,"So the point you are made in that week ensure to have access to quality, good quality teacher to those who are marginalized children."
35922,PS4,3,340.56,343.36,2.8,3.0,So there's one way of resources.
35922,PS4,3,343.88,348.08,4.2,1.0,Could we talk something about like online learning?
35922,PS4,3,348.16,353.12,4.96,1.0,Because I think that's that's an easier way to spread than building infrastructure from scratch.
35922,PS4,3,353.56,357.48,3.92,1.0,And it's a simpler form of education that I think most government scan adoptions.
35922,PS4,3,357.48,360.96,3.48,1.0,We have such a huge integration of technology in our lives.
35922,PS4,3,362.92,363.76,0.84,3.0,Completely.
35922,PS4,3,364.28,380.32,16.04,3.0,So another way is to help those marginalized children who are facing like this inequality who are completely being different from the education and that's so to provide the online opportunities to them.
35922,PS4,3,380.92,401.08,20.16,3.0,"But the question would be what if they don't have access to Internet and they are even living in those areas, for example, where the access to Internet is not a viable option, then what we can go for like alternative."
35922,PS4,3,402.0,405.12,3.12,3.0,So there are many other alternative options.
35922,PS4,3,407.12,408.32,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, so."
35922,PS4,3,410.04,412.64,2.6,3.0,"So we need to only one creative idea, right?"
35922,PS4,3,413.96,418.96,5.0,3.0,So please come up with one creative idea to welcome inequality and education.
35922,PS4,3,422.96,423.24,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35922,PS4,3,424.04,434.36,10.32,3.0,"Yeah, we can talk about like we insurance of resources and under resources we can sub, categorize and even bring the online component as well."
35922,PS4,3,458.04,459.96,1.92,1.0,Like a centralized government learning app?
35922,PS4,3,460.76,464.6,3.84,2.0,"Yes, from marginalized."
35922,PS4,3,472.28,473.2,0.92,2.0,With I.
35922,PS4,3,473.24,476.0,2.76,3.0,Think like ensuring equitable access to.
35922,PS4,3,477.2,477.92,0.72,2.0,Insurance.
35922,PS4,3,477.92,482.36,4.44,3.0,Resources which includes access.
35922,PS4,3,482.36,495.48,13.12,3.0,"So equitable access means those students who are marginalized, they will need some more intensive resources and the other would like don't need too much, but we will have to provide all the resources."
35922,PS4,3,497.12,497.8,0.68,3.0,Was it proved?
35922,PS4,3,497.84,498.56,0.72,3.0,"Yeah, so."
35922,PS4,3,498.56,499.6,1.04,1.0,Government based online.
35922,PS4,3,501.48,504.4,2.92,2.0,Researchers Government based.
35922,PS4,3,504.4,504.76,0.36,2.0,Online based.
35922,PS4,3,506.96,507.92,0.96,1.0,On what you mentioned.
35922,PS4,3,508.28,509.68,1.4,2.0,I don't know what how to.
35922,PS4,3,510.76,511.16,0.4,1.0,Like.

36354,PS3,6,38.56,40.4,1.84,4.0,Or can you say something else like?
36354,PS3,6,41.96,42.28,0.32,1.0,Exactly.
36354,PS3,6,43.44,44.52,1.08,4.0,Like apologies or something.
36354,PS3,6,44.52,47.08,2.56,1.0,"Yeah, just using a different term."
36354,PS3,6,49.2,51.68,2.48,2.0,But sorry is probably like the most common word.
36354,PS3,6,51.68,52.32,0.64,3.0,People would.
36354,PS3,6,52.6,54.04,1.44,2.0,Automatically use.
36354,PS3,6,54.4,58.32,3.92,1.0,"Yeah, I don't even replace it with a different model like gesture."
36354,PS3,6,58.88,59.12,0.24,4.0,Yeah.
36354,PS3,6,61.36,62.2,0.84,3.0,To reduce it.
36354,PS3,6,63.4,67.72,4.32,5.0,"We make as many people aware which is possible, so campaign or something."
36354,PS3,6,70.6,83.36,12.76,6.0,"The language is constantly created, and so so long as we created different words and substitution of the word sorry or just use apologies as kind of the ingrained cultural reshift, then it'll be perfectly fine."
36354,PS3,6,84.12,84.32,0.2,6.0,Yeah.
36354,PS3,6,86.92,88.32,1.4,6.0,Should we just say a different word then?
36354,PS3,6,88.48,88.76,0.28,6.0,Yeah.
36354,PS3,6,88.76,89.08,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36354,PS3,6,96.36,98.0,1.64,1.0,So just use a different word.
36354,PS3,6,104.28,105.08,0.8,1.0,Do I add any?
36354,PS3,6,106.44,106.92,0.48,4.0,Other word.
36354,PS3,6,107.68,120.4,12.72,1.0,"Oh, should I add anything else?"
36354,PS3,6,121.08,121.28,0.2,2.0,Maybe.
36354,PS3,6,121.28,122.72,1.44,3.0,We could think of how to.
36354,PS3,6,123.96,124.36,0.4,2.0,Like.
36354,PS3,6,124.6,124.92,0.32,1.0,Bring.
36354,PS3,6,124.92,126.48,1.56,2.0,People to not use the word.
36354,PS3,6,126.76,127.32,0.56,1.0,Anymore.
36354,PS3,6,127.64,138.64,11.0,2.0,"It's like of course, like people can just use apologies, but like, for instance, like I would probably keep on saying sorry and always forgetting about that I'm going to spread like the new pandemic."
36354,PS3,6,138.64,139.56,0.92,2.0,So how can we?
36354,PS3,6,140.12,143.0,2.88,2.0,"I don't know, Maybe we can think of an idea how to?"
36354,PS3,6,143.0,143.56,0.56,3.0,Actually.
36354,PS3,6,143.56,147.12,3.56,2.0,Implement the word apologies instead of stories in people's minds.
36354,PS3,6,150.92,156.48,5.56,3.0,Like do Polish people who speak sorry or do you give reward to people who say apology money?
36354,PS3,6,156.6,157.88,1.28,2.0,"Maybe give reward, Yeah."
36354,PS3,6,157.88,172.8,14.92,2.0,"Or like, I don't know, running, running marketing ads for people to remember that they shouldn't say the word sorry."
36354,PS3,6,179.92,185.12,5.2,1.0,So is that or when did you say it?
36354,PS3,6,185.12,186.0,0.88,1.0,Like punish?
36354,PS3,6,187.72,188.04,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36354,PS3,6,189.08,191.48,2.4,2.0,"OK, yeah, I would rather reward them than punish them."
36354,PS3,6,200.8,210.72,9.92,1.0,"Should I add anything else, like maybe like just making sure that everyone, like if making sure everyone knows that this is the cause of the pandemic?"
36354,PS3,6,211.88,212.2,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36354,PS3,6,237.76,239.68,1.92,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36354,PS3,6,240.2,241.8,1.6,1.0,"Try, try, you know, Yeah, OK."
34336,PS4,6,0.0,494.2,14.68,1.0,"Educational inequality is the unequal distribution of academic resources to disadvantaged and marginalized groups please come up with one creative solution, one creative idea to overcome inequality and education that's."
34336,PS4,6,494.2,494.84,0.64,6.0,Hard.
34336,PS4,6,494.96,496.44,1.48,6.0,That's a really big scope I.
34336,PS4,6,496.64,497.76,1.12,3.0,Have an idea?
34336,PS4,6,497.76,498.12,0.36,1.0,Yes.
34336,PS4,6,500.44,508.72,8.28,3.0,"So if you OK, So what I I guess the first person is what makes it unequal."
34336,PS4,6,508.72,510.12,1.4,3.0,Like what's what's is the problem?
34336,PS4,6,510.12,514.24,4.12,3.0,So it means like let's say in Cambridge you have certain textbook and other cases you don't try.
34336,PS4,6,514.84,528.64,13.8,3.0,"So maybe form a program where every year people have to give their textbooks or their book like just instead of keeping it or hoarding it in your school, you have to give it away to underprivileged communities."
34336,PS4,6,529.08,532.12,3.04,3.0,"And after the first year of that happening, it will continue happening annual."
34336,PS4,6,532.68,539.28,6.6,3.0,They will always have books that the same or as if it's not up to date it'll just be a year back.
34336,PS4,6,539.32,539.68,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,539.8,542.68,2.88,2.0,But do you mean the physical books or the cost contents?
34336,PS4,6,542.72,545.04,2.32,2.0,Because everything now is like PowerPoint.
34336,PS4,6,545.04,546.2,1.16,5.0,"Yeah, it's all digital."
34336,PS4,6,546.2,547.72,1.52,3.0,No less privilege.
34336,PS4,6,548.64,548.84,0.2,5.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,549.48,552.32,2.84,3.0,Digitization is a privilege many who don't have computers.
34336,PS4,6,552.48,555.36,2.88,6.0,"True, I feel that, especially why can't."
34336,PS4,6,555.36,555.44,0.08,1.0,We.
34336,PS4,6,555.44,562.56,7.12,4.0,Just have like public education system where like the government has to give the same tablet box to everyone or tablets or whatever.
34336,PS4,6,562.56,563.16,0.6,3.0,But they don't.
34336,PS4,6,563.32,564.16,0.84,3.0,That's the problem.
34336,PS4,6,564.2,564.84,0.64,1.0,"Yes, that's the."
34336,PS4,6,564.84,571.32,6.48,4.0,"Solution just have like a public education system, which is there's no interference of the private sector at all."
34336,PS4,6,571.96,572.2,0.24,3.0,No.
34336,PS4,6,572.2,574.76,2.56,3.0,So I think even within that I don't know.
34336,PS4,6,575.04,581.68,6.64,3.0,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but like in America, different public schools are different from other different public schools?"
34336,PS4,6,581.68,582.16,0.48,3.0,"They're not, Yeah."
34336,PS4,6,582.4,586.24,3.84,4.0,"Yeah, so then the solution is 11 standard."
34336,PS4,6,586.24,587.64,1.4,3.0,"Public, they don't do."
34336,PS4,6,588.0,592.88,4.88,1.0,"That well, I should say this, we have that and we have better ones and they're not private."
34336,PS4,6,592.96,596.28,3.32,1.0,Like I went to a better public school and it's public.
34336,PS4,6,596.28,599.08,2.8,1.0,"Like it's, it's it's city run, right."
34336,PS4,6,599.44,602.6,3.16,1.0,But not all public schools are created equal.
34336,PS4,6,602.6,604.12,1.52,1.0,"So they have a standard, but it's low."
34336,PS4,6,604.12,610.92,6.8,1.0,"The standard is low and it's also who is enforcing it, even if it was a higher standard."
34336,PS4,6,610.92,614.32,3.4,1.0,"It's about like, I guess, like how do you make sure that it's consistent?"
34336,PS4,6,614.6,616.24,1.64,1.0,"But I think the, the thinking is there."
34336,PS4,6,616.24,622.56,6.32,1.0,"The question is like, I think no matter what, it should begin really young because education begins really young, right?"
34336,PS4,6,623.0,624.28,1.28,1.0,Elementary as a child.
34336,PS4,6,624.28,635.24,10.96,1.0,"There's, there's, I mean, of course it's helpful to high schoolers if we help them, but it's much better if we can help children like in primary school to set them up from from that."
34336,PS4,6,635.76,644.68,8.92,1.0,"I think the idea that we're both all talking about, I like people have been mentioning is something standard, like both you and Rowan mentioning something standard."
34336,PS4,6,644.68,649.96,5.28,1.0,So that way it's an equal distribution of like the same kind of content.
34336,PS4,6,650.28,651.0,0.72,1.0,I think.
34336,PS4,6,652.0,654.92,2.92,1.0,"I think the thinking is also quality, right?"
34336,PS4,6,654.92,657.2,2.28,1.0,How do we overcome that gap?
34336,PS4,6,658.8,672.08,13.28,5.0,"Something that was being done for quite some time, at least in Indian schools were that they used to have like a quota system like 15% of like the class has to be people who are from disadvantaged or underprivileged background."
34336,PS4,6,672.44,675.4,2.96,5.0,That way they were trying to bridge inequality.
34336,PS4,6,675.4,679.04,3.64,5.0,But I'm not quite sure how much of a difference that would make.
34336,PS4,6,679.16,682.68,3.52,5.0,But that was like a major solution.
34336,PS4,6,682.8,684.44,1.64,5.0,But I don't know.
34336,PS4,6,684.44,689.32,4.88,5.0,I haven't followed up on what the effects of it has been like.
34336,PS4,6,689.92,696.8,6.88,6.0,"But the results before we come up with the solution, we have to define like what are the inequality that we're trying to close?"
34336,PS4,6,696.8,701.68,4.88,6.0,Is it between regions or is it between like different social classes within the same community?
34336,PS4,6,702.12,702.56,0.44,6.0,Because it's a.
34336,PS4,6,702.56,703.56,1.0,4.0,Marginalized coup over.
34336,PS4,6,703.8,704.96,1.16,2.0,Here disadvantage.
34336,PS4,6,705.2,705.72,0.52,1.0,Marginalized.
34336,PS4,6,706.0,706.64,0.64,4.0,Which couldn't be.
34336,PS4,6,706.72,707.28,0.56,1.0,Anything I don't have?
34336,PS4,6,708.6,708.96,0.36,3.0,My glasses.
34336,PS4,6,709.44,712.52,3.08,1.0,For that no disadvantage and marginalized anything.
34336,PS4,6,712.52,713.36,0.84,1.0,Do you know what I mean?
34336,PS4,6,714.04,723.64,9.6,1.0,"Like, but if you look at the states that could be like certain like groups of people of colour, but you could a disadvantage could could be children who are disabled could look at."
34336,PS4,6,723.8,724.12,0.32,4.0,People who?
34336,PS4,6,724.88,726.68,1.8,1.0,"Well, yeah, absolutely."
34336,PS4,6,726.72,735.64,8.92,2.0,"But I don't know about elementary school, but let's say in university or high school where the students have more brain power to process what the teacher said."
34336,PS4,6,735.88,739.28,3.4,2.0,I think it's OK that we don't do things physically at these times.
34336,PS4,6,739.56,749.52,9.96,2.0,So then the teacher's salary can be saved and then maybe perhaps they can play videos that are from very high quality teacher from all over the world to the students.
34336,PS4,6,749.72,755.84,6.12,2.0,And inside the classroom there will be only like 1 assistant or two assistant to assist physically if you have any questions.
34336,PS4,6,756.24,759.48,3.24,2.0,But then they are actually listening to world class teachers.
34336,PS4,6,759.96,760.32,0.36,5.0,I think.
34336,PS4,6,760.6,761.4,0.8,2.0,Basically I mean it's.
34336,PS4,6,761.4,762.68,1.28,5.0,Just all digital education.
34336,PS4,6,762.72,768.32,5.6,2.0,"Yeah, and we don't even need, I mean, we need a place, but do we need like schools?"
34336,PS4,6,769.16,770.44,1.28,2.0,It can be everywhere.
34336,PS4,6,770.56,773.0,2.44,3.0,"Well, I think that human interaction will be missed."
34336,PS4,6,773.0,775.76,2.76,3.0,"So for example, during COVID, I don't know if anybody was in."
34336,PS4,6,775.76,776.92,1.16,6.0,School during COVID?
34336,PS4,6,777.08,778.12,1.04,3.0,"Me, I hate it."
34336,PS4,6,778.12,779.52,1.4,3.0,"Like I, I hated it."
34336,PS4,6,779.96,781.96,2.0,3.0,I hated and this was not even a video.
34336,PS4,6,782.0,784.72,2.72,3.0,This was me going on Zoom and having classes.
34336,PS4,6,784.76,785.48,0.72,3.0,It was different.
34336,PS4,6,786.24,791.92,5.68,2.0,"Perhaps we can categorize people based on their learning, not ability or preference."
34336,PS4,6,791.92,792.24,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,792.6,805.2,12.6,1.0,"I think we could, you know, I think that's an idea of categorizing might be a good idea because I know they say come up with one creative idea, but it's tough because as you say, it's like, which group are we serving and what what is that?"
34336,PS4,6,805.2,805.72,0.52,1.0,So it's.
34336,PS4,6,805.96,809.36,3.4,2.0,You can then utilize resources better according to their preference then.
34336,PS4,6,809.6,810.04,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,810.32,814.96,4.64,1.0,"I think what we can, it sounds like what we're all like sort of squirting or like what at least what Mathis is saying."
34336,PS4,6,814.96,817.76,2.8,1.0,"And like is like, OK, what digital tools can we use?"
34336,PS4,6,817.76,821.44,3.68,1.0,"And Row, I hear when you mention like not everyone has accessibility to that."
34336,PS4,6,821.76,833.32,11.56,1.0,"It's like, OK, that's another issue of like the distribution of academic resources like Internet access, tablets, mobiles, so on and so forth."
34336,PS4,6,833.56,840.56,7.0,1.0,"Maybe that is an issue that we focus on, which is like the issue is being able to access all of the information of the world."
34336,PS4,6,840.56,841.36,0.8,1.0,Internet exists.
34336,PS4,6,841.36,847.24,5.88,1.0,"If you're able to teach children how to research or how to look things up and give them free access, they they can soar."
34336,PS4,6,847.48,856.52,9.04,1.0,"So maybe the one that we can focus on is like access to tech, access to tech, access to access to these resources, you know, and you."
34336,PS4,6,856.64,859.04,2.4,3.0,Can use those like categorization.
34336,PS4,6,859.08,866.4,7.32,1.0,"Yeah, maybe it's, I don't know what, because like something that New York does, they gave out tablets and laptops to all the children."
34336,PS4,6,866.64,869.64,3.0,1.0,"But the issue was sometimes these kids didn't have Wi-Fi, right?"
34336,PS4,6,869.76,870.68,0.92,1.0,So you could have like.
34336,PS4,6,871.48,878.32,6.84,4.0,"Like these like libraries, but like computer libraries where you just come and you can use 24/7 and like sit and do your work."
34336,PS4,6,878.56,878.84,0.28,1.0,Library.
34336,PS4,6,879.84,884.44,4.6,4.0,"Yeah, free like a library, but like for computers to use like instead of the books."
34336,PS4,6,884.44,886.44,2.0,4.0,So like a digital library basically.
34336,PS4,6,886.76,889.88,3.12,4.0,"So you like because you have physical libraries, you can have digital."
34336,PS4,6,890.32,893.92,3.6,6.0,So you set them up in like underprivileged community so that OK.
34336,PS4,6,894.64,897.32,2.68,4.0,"And then you have like Wi-Fi there, you have like computers, tablets."
34336,PS4,6,897.4,897.72,0.32,1.0,And stuff.
34336,PS4,6,897.72,898.12,0.4,1.0,Set up.
34336,PS4,6,898.12,899.44,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, physically expansion."
34336,PS4,6,901.72,902.72,1.0,6.0,Of infrastructure.
34336,PS4,6,902.8,903.48,0.68,5.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,903.48,907.08,3.6,5.0,And then we can also provide some sort of digital literacy while doing that.
34336,PS4,6,907.56,908.04,0.48,1.0,Yes.
34336,PS4,6,908.04,915.76,7.72,1.0,So it's the so it's essentially the expansion of libraries is that is everyone came in life like starting with that this.
34336,PS4,6,919.4,921.28,1.88,6.0,Is a tough one because it's so.
34336,PS4,6,921.56,923.56,2.0,5.0,"It's so yeah, it's very broad, the scopes."
34336,PS4,6,923.76,925.36,1.6,3.0,Like and I seen come up with one.
34336,PS4,6,925.4,931.2,5.8,6.0,That's and I feel that like human hasn't been able to like fully fix that.
34336,PS4,6,931.48,931.92,0.44,6.0,That's why.
34336,PS4,6,936.28,936.64,0.36,5.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,937.72,944.08,6.36,2.0,"To be fair, like, it's not a fair statement, but the world is always unequal and not justice."
34336,PS4,6,944.36,951.4,7.04,2.0,"What I would prefer to do is send my kids to maybe be a hairdresser early on, like from 10 years old onwards."
34336,PS4,6,951.4,953.08,1.68,2.0,And then they can earn money.
34336,PS4,6,953.48,953.72,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,953.72,956.72,3.0,2.0,And then they can have at least one skills that are very tangible.
34336,PS4,6,957.08,962.72,5.64,2.0,"And if they want to learn anything that they're interested, it's their, you know, they belong to them."
34336,PS4,6,963.2,966.64,3.44,2.0,So they can earn their own money and they can learn when they're 18 or something.
34336,PS4,6,966.68,968.32,1.64,2.0,They choose to what they can learn.
34336,PS4,6,969.36,971.48,2.12,5.0,Like 1 vocational training clause but.
34336,PS4,6,972.8,976.16,3.36,3.0,Like it's now like almost taboos like not send your child to like.
34336,PS4,6,976.4,978.96,2.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34336,PS4,6,979.24,982.6,3.36,4.0,But like maybe like have one trade that they learn.
34336,PS4,6,983.48,984.6,1.12,3.0,Everybody had a trade.
34336,PS4,6,984.92,985.04,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34336,PS4,6,985.48,986.0,0.52,6.0,What's a trade?
34336,PS4,6,986.36,987.08,0.72,1.0,A trade so.
34336,PS4,6,987.16,987.52,0.36,3.0,"Like, oh a."
34336,PS4,6,987.64,989.16,1.52,2.0,Trade B Electrician.
34336,PS4,6,990.72,992.32,1.6,6.0,What are we talking about in educational?
34336,PS4,6,992.32,994.44,2.12,6.0,Because you're talking we have professional skills and we.
34336,PS4,6,994.44,995.56,1.12,5.0,This is vocational trade.
34336,PS4,6,995.8,1008.4,12.6,6.0,Fundamental like just how you think and what your identity as a citizen like that type type of education would be one thing as well because that will benefit who you are as a person no matter what trait you go so.
34336,PS4,6,1009.16,1015.24,6.08,2.0,"But I don't know, it's very cruel to say it, but I don't know if they have the privilege to choose it."
34336,PS4,6,1015.68,1024.52,8.84,2.0,"I think they can do like a very AI thing at the questionnaire, then determine who they are, they are and then what they're good at and then they."
34336,PS4,6,1024.6,1026.2,1.6,3.0,Specialize you just.
34336,PS4,6,1033.32,1033.52,0.2,5.0,Start.
34336,PS4,6,1033.52,1034.88,1.36,5.0,How are we going to implement that?
34336,PS4,6,1034.88,1036.28,1.4,5.0,Like how will we start?
34336,PS4,6,1036.28,1038.4,2.12,1.0,"Doing it, it's going."
34336,PS4,6,1038.4,1042.88,4.48,5.0,To be a long process so divergent.
34336,PS4,6,1043.28,1044.4,1.12,6.0,And remember that.
34336,PS4,6,1044.6,1048.2,3.6,1.0,"Guys, this is what I've written following the five wires and fishbone diagram."
34336,PS4,6,1050.52,1050.8,0.28,1.0,What?
34336,PS4,6,1052.04,1052.72,0.68,1.0,"Yes, it's true."
34336,PS4,6,1052.72,1055.32,2.6,1.0,We resolved that a crucial issue is access to resources.
34336,PS4,6,1055.32,1066.24,10.92,1.0,"We recommend the expansion of libraries for people to access free informational resources and and Internet access, run programs of digital literacy, offer tablets, offer digital textbooks, etcetera."
34336,PS4,6,1067.72,1068.8,1.08,1.0,Anything else I'm missing?
34336,PS4,6,1070.88,1072.56,1.68,6.0,I mean she can always look up our script.
34336,PS4,6,1076.2,1076.56,0.36,1.0,OK.
34336,PS4,6,1076.6,1077.44,0.84,1.0,Are we OK with that?
34336,PS4,6,1077.48,1079.32,1.84,1.0,Is there anything else that you guys want me to?
34336,PS4,6,1080.56,1081.8,1.24,6.0,We're not going to write a business good.
34301,PS4,6,24.56,26.64,2.08,2.0,Educational inequality is the unequal.
34301,PS4,6,26.64,27.36,0.72,3.0,Distribution.
34301,PS4,6,27.36,31.72,4.36,2.0,Of academic resources to disadvantaged and marginalized groups.
34301,PS4,6,32.44,37.04,4.6,2.0,Please come up with one creative idea to overcome inequality in education.
34301,PS4,6,48.65,48.77,0.12,4.0,OK.
34301,PS4,6,48.77,50.05,1.28,4.0,So just green storm it seems like.
34301,PS4,6,50.49,57.33,6.84,5.0,"A straightforward one, but yeah, just building like educational centres in accessibility."
34301,PS4,6,57.73,60.09,2.36,1.0,In accessibility like in terms of.
34301,PS4,6,60.09,67.36,7.27,5.0,"Yeah, just like in marginalised communities, just build those centres in those locations so that they can access."
34301,PS4,6,68.64,85.64,17.0,2.0,"I don't know what it's like other places, but in the US your, your city or your, yeah, your tax, tax based on your zip code or your city that you live in."
34301,PS4,6,86.0,88.52,2.52,2.0,And that goes to your school district.
34301,PS4,6,88.8,90.8,2.0,2.0,So the school districts get their money from their tax.
34301,PS4,6,90.8,93.12,2.32,4.0,Base so it's a self reinforcing.
34301,PS4,6,93.24,93.52,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
34301,PS4,6,93.52,104.16,10.64,2.0,"So you have the wealthy areas that the schools are better because they have a higher like they pay more taxes and they so their schools always have more funding, right."
34301,PS4,6,104.4,108.2,3.8,2.0,"And so I think that like in the US, that's one of the biggest challenges to overcome."
34301,PS4,6,108.2,110.84,2.64,2.0,But I I don't know so.
34301,PS4,6,111.36,111.68,0.32,5.0,That's like.
34301,PS4,6,111.84,112.32,0.48,2.0,Other places.
34301,PS4,6,113.76,124.72,10.96,4.0,"I would add that in in Germany, even though schooling in general is free, you might have teachers who prefer not to go to a certain area because it's kind of a critical or difficult area."
34301,PS4,6,124.72,135.28,10.56,4.0,"So even though technically they have the same funding, there might be areas where really you'd find it hard to to find teachers."
34301,PS4,6,135.28,144.04,8.76,4.0,"Also in like very rural areas where teachers might not want to go to, you may have shortage of teachers."
34301,PS4,6,148.16,150.48,2.32,5.0,That's kind of the same in Tanzania.
34301,PS4,6,150.48,153.6,3.12,5.0,"So OK, two issues."
34301,PS4,6,153.76,161.72,7.96,5.0,First with like government funded education generally like it's poor quality across the country.
34301,PS4,6,161.72,171.08,9.36,5.0,"So private schools where you have to pay for the fee for your fees, those tend to provide better quality education."
34301,PS4,6,171.6,178.28,6.68,5.0,"But again, it's only like people who have I guess middle income or rich families can afford private education."
34301,PS4,6,178.28,191.52,13.24,5.0,So in terms of how you and second the point that Robert said around most people teachers would want to teach in like rural areas.
34301,PS4,6,191.52,196.64,5.12,5.0,So it is skewed in the sense that most of the good schools are in the cities.
34301,PS4,6,198.28,235.2,36.92,5.0,"How you flip that around, I think it's tied with creating like depending on what's viable in that space, but like, I guess creating some sort of economic, how do I put it, like whether it's businesses or just some sort of economic activities happening in those areas that will then boost those communities because otherwise no one really wants to go to a place that is not accessible like poor roads."
34301,PS4,6,236.36,237.2,0.84,5.0,Why would you go there?
34301,PS4,6,237.2,250.04,12.84,5.0,So trying to create some sort of economic activities around those areas so that families that businesses that are there like if if I'm working in that place and that my children can probably go.
34301,PS4,6,250.4,250.52,0.12,2.0,To.
34301,PS4,6,250.52,251.6,1.08,5.0,Schools around that area.
34301,PS4,6,252.24,252.52,0.28,4.0,"Yeah, it's."
34301,PS4,6,254.2,256.52,2.32,3.0,Kind of similar to US and Germany.
34301,PS4,6,257.04,272.56,15.52,3.0,"It's like if you really want to go to another place to study, but based on your address, you should go here and then you need to pay probably double or triple tuition fee compared with the the region, people living that region based on the hundreds."
34301,PS4,6,278.4,284.68,6.28,4.0,Maybe to to suggest something to to have a creative idea could be to rotate children.
34301,PS4,6,284.72,296.32,11.6,4.0,"Of course they, they would mean they would live in other places for a certain period of time, but you can have them rotate on a monthly or term basis as in this quarter."
34301,PS4,6,296.32,297.2,0.88,4.0,"Yeah, exactly."
34301,PS4,6,297.44,312.84,15.4,4.0,"You live in the South and in the North and of course it creates trouble for the family relationship maybe, but it gives you some idea, some, some opportunity to participate from different or in different types of schools in different parts of the country."
34301,PS4,6,312.84,312.92,0.08,4.0,So.
34301,PS4,6,313.6,314.6,1.0,1.0,Student exchange programs.
34301,PS4,6,315.08,318.96,3.88,4.0,"Yeah, where it's not cross-border, but just cross schools in the same."
34301,PS4,6,320.0,320.36,0.36,1.0,Country.
34301,PS4,6,320.84,321.08,0.24,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34301,PS4,6,326.88,330.36,3.48,1.0,I've typed that because I I was going to say different countries we suffer.
34301,PS4,6,331.04,332.6,1.56,1.0,The inequality is for different reasons.
34301,PS4,6,332.8,334.56,1.76,1.0,"In Africa, it is because of location."
34301,PS4,6,335.44,343.0,7.56,1.0,"Schools aren't actually located in underprivileged societies and they have to travel 20 kilometres, sometimes walking to get to school and back."
34301,PS4,6,344.12,348.4,4.28,1.0,But in the USI know the funding structure is a it just exacerbates the problem.
34301,PS4,6,348.68,350.32,1.64,1.0,Funding is allocated to richer schools.
34301,PS4,6,350.68,355.96,5.28,1.0,"Those children benefit, they perform and get more funding and so it's a different problem."
34301,PS4,6,355.96,360.68,4.72,1.0,But I think the the school exchange program would address some of that.
34301,PS4,6,361.28,362.28,1.0,1.0,So shall I.
34301,PS4,6,362.88,364.64,1.76,5.0,"Oh wait, do we need to come up with just one?"
34301,PS4,6,364.64,365.56,0.92,1.0,Idea exactly.
34301,PS4,6,365.56,365.76,0.2,5.0,Right.
34301,PS4,6,365.76,367.68,1.92,5.0,"So we need to like, what's the best one?"
34301,PS4,6,367.68,368.12,0.44,5.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34301,PS4,6,368.36,368.76,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
34301,PS4,6,368.76,373.0,4.24,1.0,So any other problems in other countries in the Uki don't actually know what the problems are.
34301,PS4,6,373.0,374.8,1.8,1.0,Education is pretty widely available here.
34301,PS4,6,375.48,376.48,1.0,6.0,"Yeah, I mean, I don't."
34301,PS4,6,376.52,376.96,0.44,1.0,Think.
34301,PS4,6,377.16,382.44,5.28,6.0,"There's some variation between location, and it tends to be location based."
34301,PS4,6,382.44,384.76,2.32,6.0,"You see, there's a big difference between public and private."
34301,PS4,6,385.04,385.48,0.44,1.0,School.
34301,PS4,6,386.92,393.84,6.92,6.0,"But it's mostly location based and like you said, some teachers don't want to work in the in some of the sort of."
34301,PS4,6,395.48,396.08,0.6,4.0,More.
34301,PS4,6,397.56,398.92,1.36,6.0,Difficult locations.
34301,PS4,6,401.2,401.68,0.48,2.0,How you?
34301,PS4,6,402.4,405.0,2.6,6.0,"Overcome that, I like the rotation idea."
34301,PS4,6,406.92,414.68,7.76,6.0,"Apart from redistributing resources, can't see another creative solution to it."
34301,PS4,6,414.88,416.28,1.4,1.0,"So redistribution, I think."
34301,PS4,6,416.8,417.68,0.88,5.0,"Sorry, go ahead."
34301,PS4,6,417.92,421.68,3.76,1.0,So redistribution as well from high income schools to low income.
34301,PS4,6,421.8,424.28,2.48,6.0,"Yeah, it's an equalisation of resources between."
34301,PS4,6,424.48,427.96,3.48,1.0,"Equalisation of resources, yeah."
34301,PS4,6,430.16,435.16,5.0,5.0,"Yeah, because I think that will have the most impact and is perhaps."
34301,PS4,6,435.4,437.36,1.96,1.0,Maybe drag it down?
34301,PS4,6,437.52,438.4,0.88,1.0,Drag everything down.
34301,PS4,6,439.44,440.0,0.56,5.0,What do you mean?
34301,PS4,6,440.68,454.44,13.76,1.0,"So when you have some top performers, low performers, when you redistribute wealth, you result in this, you don't result in that, you result in a lower level of education across the board."
34301,PS4,6,454.96,458.4,3.44,1.0,So that is the outcome of redistribution of wealth policies.
34301,PS4,6,458.68,459.56,0.88,5.0,"No, but OK."
34301,PS4,6,459.64,471.68,12.04,5.0,"So maybe you're going extreme and we're not saying completely RIP schools that have, let's say excess funding such that it's completely even throughout the country."
34301,PS4,6,471.92,474.8,2.88,5.0,And then now it's just maybe like a poor quality school.
34301,PS4,6,475.08,485.96,10.88,5.0,"We just say, say we have millions, perhaps contribute 5% of that excess fund and try to contribute to areas that completely have no funding."
34301,PS4,6,486.12,488.92,2.8,5.0,So it's not like complete even it's out across the whole.
34301,PS4,6,488.92,489.88,0.96,1.0,"Country, I hear what you're saying."
34301,PS4,6,491.44,509.04,17.6,1.0,"I think if you practically, if you do that, the child in school from a low income would have a much greater benefit from rotating to a school that has all the resources infrastructure because you take him out of that community and you're exposing him to all of these resources."
34301,PS4,6,510.0,512.88,2.88,1.0,And so I think it would have a higher success rate.
34301,PS4,6,513.48,514.6,1.12,5.0,"I don't know, it probably will."
34301,PS4,6,514.6,523.96,9.36,5.0,"But my only issue with this is I feel because you have few schools that are good and then lots of schools that are not good, so how many people can rotate in those few schools?"
34301,PS4,6,524.24,533.08,8.84,5.0,So it's easy to just maybe 10% of your budget allocate allocated to a few other schools and then we build on those.
34301,PS4,6,533.08,534.48,1.4,5.0,But I don't know what others are thinking.
34301,PS4,6,534.48,536.44,1.96,5.0,Teachers or maybe rotate teachers.
34301,PS4,6,536.44,537.76,1.32,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34301,PS4,6,538.08,538.36,0.28,5.0,Then.
34301,PS4,6,539.08,540.56,1.48,2.0,Within a geographic region.
34301,PS4,6,540.56,541.12,0.56,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34301,PS4,6,541.76,542.92,1.16,3.0,And also ask the student.
34301,PS4,6,542.92,544.32,1.4,2.0,To pay more just like the.
34301,PS4,6,544.68,546.04,1.36,3.0,"Chinese government did, yeah."
34301,PS4,6,546.08,548.48,2.4,3.0,You paid 3% tuition.
34301,PS4,6,548.92,550.24,1.32,1.0,"OK, I've got to go with an answer now."
34301,PS4,6,550.24,552.96,2.72,1.0,So am I going to delete this and go rotate teachers?
34301,PS4,6,553.32,554.48,1.16,1.0,Because I'd quite like that idea.
34301,PS4,6,554.48,557.12,2.64,1.0,It's much easier to implement that than rotating children.
34301,PS4,6,557.72,558.84,1.12,1.0,It's less disruptive.
34301,PS4,6,559.08,563.68,4.6,1.0,It is easier for the teachers to rotate rotating teachers between.
34301,PS4,6,568.16,574.92,6.76,4.0,"If we say teachers are the main academic resource that has to be redistributed, then then that's correct."
34301,PS4,6,575.08,583.88,8.8,4.0,"But of course we can say teachers plus perhaps material or basketballs, whatever, have to be rotated as well."
34301,PS4,6,584.6,586.04,1.44,1.0,"OK, Please help me with certain structure."
34301,PS4,6,586.04,586.16,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34301,PS4,6,586.16,587.04,0.88,1.0,What do you want me to type?
34301,PS4,6,587.6,592.76,5.16,1.0,So we've agreed that teachers and students rotation would be beneficial.
34301,PS4,6,592.76,594.32,1.56,1.0,Is that what I'm going to type?
34301,PS4,6,595.2,595.72,0.52,4.0,I think.
34301,PS4,6,596.32,598.36,2.04,2.0,More remote learning opportunities soon.
34301,PS4,6,598.48,599.08,0.6,4.0,That as well.
34301,PS4,6,599.8,601.4,1.6,2.0,You have one good teacher teach.
34301,PS4,6,601.92,602.12,0.2,4.0,Yeah.
34301,PS4,6,602.12,621.2,19.08,4.0,"I mean the students possible, Yeah, like tutoring I think in some schools would have the same positive impact on marginalized groups just because there is maybe three students per tutor, whereas in other areas they may be just 50 and that."
34301,PS4,6,621.2,624.52,3.32,2.0,"Could be like the primary teachings, not remote, but there's."
34301,PS4,6,624.6,626.28,1.68,4.0,"Additional, you know."
34301,PS4,6,627.6,634.36,6.76,2.0,"Like you, you have to get teachers to win, but your top teachers, top performing teachers or whatever."
34301,PS4,6,635.12,636.24,1.12,4.0,"Yeah, their day is spent."
34301,PS4,6,636.24,638.04,1.8,4.0,"Yeah, that's right."
34301,PS4,6,638.52,639.64,1.12,4.0,"That's rats, counsellor."
34301,PS4,6,639.64,640.8,1.16,2.0,"Yes, School, yeah, I don't."
34301,PS4,6,641.12,643.68,2.56,4.0,"Know, yeah, I was thinking about that."
34301,PS4,6,643.68,646.68,3.0,4.0,So the idea could be a combination I think.
34301,PS4,6,646.84,650.32,3.48,2.0,While providing resources to those schools to be able to have for most we.
34301,PS4,6,650.32,651.04,0.72,1.0,Have less than a minute.
34301,PS4,6,651.04,652.68,1.64,1.0,Can you help me with the single structure?
34301,PS4,6,652.92,659.4,6.48,1.0,Increased remote learning opportunities and tutoring are requiring teachers from better education institutions.
34301,PS4,6,659.4,660.68,1.28,1.0,I don't know higher.
34301,PS4,6,660.88,662.56,1.68,1.0,I don't know better like I'm trying to.
34301,PS4,6,663.36,663.76,0.4,2.0,Teachers.
34301,PS4,6,664.68,672.72,8.04,1.0,Better requiring more better student teachers 2.
34301,PS4,6,674.48,675.92,1.44,5.0,By rotating them across.
34301,PS4,6,675.96,676.44,0.48,4.0,School.
34301,PS4,6,676.68,678.44,1.76,5.0,Teachers to make it clear that it's rotation.
34301,PS4,6,678.44,678.56,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
34301,PS4,6,680.36,683.68,3.32,1.0,Increase remote learning opportunities and rotating teachers.
34301,PS4,6,684.6,687.32,2.72,5.0,"Yeah, so just delete that and then at the end allow."
34301,PS4,6,688.32,695.04,6.72,1.0,So increase remote learning opportunities and tutoring by requiring better teachers to teach low performing students.
34301,PS4,6,695.04,697.16,2.12,5.0,"Yeah, by rotating them across schools."
34301,PS4,6,700.04,705.6,5.56,1.0,"Rotating the teachers, yeah, but we just said it's remote learning opportunities."
34301,PS4,6,706.44,706.56,0.12,4.0,So.
34301,PS4,6,706.64,707.28,0.64,1.0,You can still.
34301,PS4,6,707.8,708.04,0.24,4.0,"You, you."
34301,PS4,6,708.12,708.6,0.48,4.0,You can't.
34301,PS4,6,709.08,710.36,1.28,5.0,I could just write something and.
34301,PS4,6,711.44,711.76,0.32,2.0,And not by.
34301,PS4,6,712.72,712.96,0.24,1.0,And.
34301,PS4,6,715.04,716.12,1.08,2.0,And by rotating teachers.
34301,PS4,6,716.32,717.24,0.92,1.0,I'm deleting those teachers.
34301,PS4,6,718.56,719.24,0.68,4.0,Just leave that.
34301,PS4,6,721.2,725.84,4.64,1.0,How can I oh OK increase solution?
34301,PS4,6,727.4,728.72,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, it's so much better at this."
34301,PS4,6,729.6,735.6,6.0,1.0,Increase your load learning opportunities and teaching rain by requiring those teachers to teach lower performing students while rotating the teachers.
34301,PS4,6,736.12,736.44,0.32,4.0,That's fine.
34301,PS4,6,737.04,743.08,6.04,5.0,I think there must be answer like you can also yeah next question.
34253,PS1,3,0.0,926.12,3.04,1.0,Fine plastic waste.
34253,PS1,3,926.2,935.72,9.52,1.0,"One of the biggest, one of I."
34253,PS1,3,935.72,937.0,1.28,3.0,Believed first of all.
34253,PS1,3,940.92,941.6,0.68,1.0,Creative.
34253,PS1,3,941.6,944.36,2.76,3.0,Way people has been doing this for a long time.
34253,PS1,3,944.36,948.4,4.04,3.0,"Yeah, creative way."
34253,PS1,3,949.08,950.52,1.44,3.0,"Wait, so how does this game work?"
34253,PS1,3,950.52,951.88,1.36,3.0,So how do we win AI?
34253,PS1,3,952.76,953.64,0.88,2.0,We're just being compared.
34253,PS1,3,953.64,959.56,5.92,2.0,We've just been benchmarked to AI to see how our responses relate to theirs and what's different and everything.
34253,PS1,3,960.56,968.32,7.76,2.0,"I think also like the complexity in our answers or the length, just to see how their models are compared."
34253,PS1,3,968.32,970.16,1.84,3.0,"OK, so do we, How do we win?"
34253,PS1,3,970.72,971.44,0.72,3.0,We don't win.
34253,PS1,3,971.64,972.16,0.52,3.0,We don't.
34253,PS1,3,972.64,974.4,1.76,1.0,Know like the source of the data?
34253,PS1,3,975.08,976.68,1.6,3.0,"Oh, so this is like, OK."
34253,PS1,3,977.04,979.12,2.08,2.0,"Yeah, we're just playing Churchy PT right now."
34253,PS1,3,979.96,980.4,0.44,3.0,OK.
34253,PS1,3,980.64,984.12,3.48,1.0,"Eventually, if we see the paper, we know how we have performance."
34253,PS1,3,984.36,996.76,12.4,3.0,"Like a floating, there's this one that I've seen before, like a floating net that they would have been tossed to different areas of water that has that's been polluted, heavily polluted by plastic waste."
34253,PS1,3,997.16,998.88,1.72,3.0,So like this net kind of just like.
34253,PS1,3,999.88,1002.08,2.2,2.0,Pulls it fishing net but for plastic.
34253,PS1,3,1002.36,1011.28,8.92,3.0,"Yes, so so it's it's like automatically like motored, I don't know what exactly, but it has like maybe like wind or something."
34253,PS1,3,1011.28,1016.24,4.96,3.0,So it kind of pulls in the trash that come that it comes across.
34253,PS1,3,1016.52,1021.08,4.56,3.0,So it's like it would just kind of gather automatically that waste.
34253,PS1,3,1021.48,1022.8,1.32,3.0,I thought that was really cool.
34253,PS1,3,1023.12,1027.64,4.52,3.0,"And so like, once in a while, people come in and collect all the plastic away from the ocean."
34253,PS1,3,1028.16,1034.16,6.0,3.0,"But that only goes for, like, the waste that's like, around that machine."
34253,PS1,3,1034.44,1035.36,0.92,3.0,It's not really a machine.
34253,PS1,3,1035.52,1037.6,2.08,3.0,It's like a little installation.
34253,PS1,3,1038.6,1038.72,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34253,PS1,3,1038.72,1043.32,4.6,3.0,It's more like a floating installation or it's not really a robot.
34253,PS1,3,1044.88,1045.76,0.88,3.0,"Well, it's not a robot."
34253,PS1,3,1045.76,1047.44,1.68,1.0,Does it have like a motor or something?
34253,PS1,3,1047.44,1049.44,2.0,1.0,How is it like self driven or I think?
34253,PS1,3,1049.44,1050.04,0.6,3.0,It's self driven.
34253,PS1,3,1050.04,1051.84,1.8,3.0,"If it doesn't, I don't think it has a motorbike."
34253,PS1,3,1051.84,1052.76,0.92,3.0,I don't know how it works.
34253,PS1,3,1052.8,1055.24,2.44,3.0,It's like from a memory from like years ago.
34253,PS1,3,1056.12,1066.96,10.84,3.0,"I think it has has like little tentacles that kind of just like draws and things like little hooks that hooks things, you know, it's like it's quite, it's not very hard to make one."
34253,PS1,3,1067.72,1068.24,0.52,2.0,Thing is.
34253,PS1,3,1069.8,1070.72,0.92,3.0,Flow floaty?
34253,PS1,3,1070.72,1071.96,1.24,3.0,That just flows on it.
34253,PS1,3,1072.12,1072.8,0.68,3.0,Flows on the ocean?
34253,PS1,3,1072.8,1073.0,0.2,3.0,What?
34253,PS1,3,1073.04,1075.64,2.6,1.0,If it flows away and you cannot just get that.
34253,PS1,3,1075.68,1076.76,1.08,3.0,"Oh, you anchor it."
34253,PS1,3,1076.84,1077.92,1.08,3.0,You anchor it somewhere.
34253,PS1,3,1077.92,1078.44,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34253,PS1,3,1078.72,1081.0,2.28,2.0,"And how will the Internet, let's say in deep oceans?"
34253,PS1,3,1081.64,1082.12,0.48,3.0,Exactly.
34253,PS1,3,1082.12,1085.64,3.52,3.0,So basically this only gathers from a certain area.
34253,PS1,3,1086.0,1086.76,0.76,2.0,Rivers and seas.
34253,PS1,3,1087.12,1087.44,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
34253,PS1,3,1087.44,1097.92,10.48,3.0,"But this they own, they distribute this in like sea areas that's heavily polluted by plastic, plastic pollutions, plastic wastes."
34253,PS1,3,1098.08,1099.64,1.56,3.0,So it's actually quite effective.
34253,PS1,3,1100.04,1103.6,3.56,3.0,"But if you want to like collect from deep ocean, it's going to be very hard."
34253,PS1,3,1105.68,1111.72,6.04,2.0,"Yeah, and we're also talking plastic pollution in general, not only oceans, but also on land mass, everything."
34253,PS1,3,1111.8,1112.76,0.96,3.0,"But it says ocean, right?"
34253,PS1,3,1112.76,1112.92,0.16,3.0,Just.
34253,PS1,3,1114.44,1115.0,0.56,2.0,Just standard.
34253,PS1,3,1115.6,1117.32,1.72,3.0,"Oh, OK, so it could."
34253,PS1,3,1117.36,1119.56,2.2,2.0,Be in human space as well.
34253,PS1,3,1119.8,1121.88,2.08,3.0,"OK, which is not good."
34253,PS1,3,1121.88,1122.2,0.32,3.0,OK.
34253,PS1,3,1123.28,1137.48,14.2,3.0,"Can we like, can we add like magnets, magnet materials into into like plastic when manufacturing it and like they're just like we just have people going around with the magnet and it's like there."

34253,PS1,3,1177.2,1177.92,0.72,3.0,One creative idea?

34253,PS1,3,1247.2,1249.52,2.32,2.0,"Yeah, but we're specifically talking about plastic."
34253,PS1,3,1249.52,1251.24,1.72,2.0,What else can be like big?
34253,PS1,3,1251.36,1257.48,6.12,3.0,"Like plastic, like wrappers, wrappers, you know, like I never recycle those."

34253,PS1,3,1291.96,1297.16,5.2,1.0,"Really good, but it's a way like they cannot address everything."
34253,PS1,3,1297.36,1298.92,1.56,3.0,"I think we can, we like do both."
34253,PS1,3,1298.92,1305.36,6.44,3.0,"So like for the existing plastics, monetary incentives, so if you bring some plastic, we give you money."
34253,PS1,3,1305.52,1309.64,4.12,3.0,"So a lot of people can actually make money from like this way, right?"
34253,PS1,3,1309.64,1312.64,3.0,3.0,People will just go out and collect some trash and sell.
34253,PS1,3,1312.64,1316.56,3.92,2.0,"It to the government, the trash collector comes in, they weigh the plastic."
34253,PS1,3,1316.8,1320.32,3.52,2.0,"Depending how much you collected, you get cash immediately."

36422,PS1,6,102.84,106.4,3.56,4.0,Need to add that in Germany you can just save reward scheme.

36422,PS1,6,114.16,118.64,4.48,1.0,So what happens is people take it back and you get something like 15 cents like per bottle.
36422,PS1,6,118.88,121.48,2.6,1.0,"So it's a really small amount of money, but it works."
36422,PS1,6,121.48,125.68,4.2,1.0,And it actually works as well in the cities because if people leave them on the streets.
36422,PS1,6,125.96,126.44,0.48,3.0,Like rubbish.
36422,PS1,6,126.92,131.28,4.36,1.0,Homeless people collect them and they can get money by handing them so.
36422,PS1,6,132.08,134.12,2.04,5.0,So why we just do this before plastics?
36422,PS1,6,144.52,152.52,8.0,6.0,And also can get some refuse collection because if some people can get give the.

36422,PS1,6,179.32,188.96,9.64,3.0,Plastic plastic alternatives so we don't get to do use plastics use of cotton and examples so.
36422,PS1,6,188.96,189.28,0.32,1.0,What are the?
36422,PS1,6,189.88,190.8,0.92,5.0,Alternatives not like the.

36422,PS1,6,228.6,229.56,0.96,3.0,This one is OK.
36422,PS1,6,235.76,239.36,3.6,1.0,You could come up with a way of collecting plastic waste.
36422,PS1,6,239.36,244.96,5.6,1.0,"So if waste already exists, how could you collect it and remove it from places you don't want it?"
36422,PS1,6,245.44,255.96,10.52,1.0,"So I've seen that there are these things in the oceans which sort of act as like filters and they are kind of like Nets and they collect plastic and, and pick it, pick it up."
36422,PS1,6,256.0,259.52,3.52,1.0,And you could use that and then use that for recycling and reuse it.
36422,PS1,6,259.96,271.72,11.76,1.0,"So by having something that I suppose it doesn't reduce plastic pollution in its origin, but it deals with the problem and reduces plastic pollution that already exists."
36422,PS1,6,273.2,274.8,1.6,4.0,So can you just reconstruct so that you?
36422,PS1,6,275.44,276.52,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, so you could do."
36422,PS1,6,277.4,298.28,20.88,2.0,"And and how about, you know, encourage the scientists that you produce new materials can totally replace the plastic or recycling plastics in that."

36422,PS1,6,328.6,328.96,0.36,6.0,There's some.
36422,PS1,6,329.4,329.92,0.52,3.0,"Air, Yeah."

35512,PS6,3,225.28,244.08,18.8,3.0,1st but maybe not the part where it says it can't be turned off because like you're just encouraging people to sing in the shower but if it doesn't turn off then people won't judge it because of like sustainability.
35512,PS6,3,244.32,245.2,0.88,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
35512,PS6,3,246.24,248.12,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
35512,PS6,3,248.12,250.28,2.16,2.0,So get rid of it.
35512,PS6,3,250.96,252.52,1.56,3.0,Can still be playing.
35512,PS6,3,254.92,258.72,3.8,2.0,Or how about the speaker is programmed to stay over 20 minutes?
35512,PS6,3,258.8,269.88,11.08,2.0,"Yeah, the speaker is programmed to 20 minutes."
35512,PS6,3,273.52,281.12,7.6,1.0,"Actually, I'm not sure about how I believe they are the picking every time, but taking a shower, 20 minutes, you know the landing."

35303,PS4,3,25.4,25.64,0.24,1.0,OK.
35303,PS4,3,26.16,33.44,7.28,2.0,"OK, the first thing that comes to mind is which I know has problems, is to make everything online obvious."
35303,PS4,3,33.44,35.16,1.72,2.0,"Problem is, do people have access?"
35303,PS4,3,35.16,36.8,1.64,1.0,"To it we're like, is it typing?"
35303,PS4,3,42.44,42.68,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,47.6,49.76,2.16,1.0,"So make make education online, yeah."
35303,PS4,3,51.76,53.8,2.04,2.0,Make resources available online even though.
35303,PS4,3,53.8,54.08,0.28,2.0,"OK, sorry."
35303,PS4,3,60.24,68.04,7.8,1.0,"But then in my country, to be honest, the the issues that in most rural areas, those."
35303,PS4,3,68.2,69.08,0.88,2.0,My people who live.
35303,PS4,3,69.16,75.04,5.88,1.0,"There they don't actually have the access to data and that's quite that's quite tough, to be honest."
35303,PS4,3,75.04,75.32,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, I."
35303,PS4,3,75.64,75.8,0.16,2.0,Agree.
35303,PS4,3,75.8,76.56,0.76,2.0,I know that I mean.
35303,PS4,3,76.8,81.92,5.12,1.0,But I think this is a very beautiful solution because we've done it also in the Covet during the pandemic.
35303,PS4,3,81.92,82.12,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,82.4,86.56,4.16,1.0,So every every lecturer is like doing things online.
35303,PS4,3,86.64,95.6,8.96,1.0,And then the government should like be there and and make the signal available for those marginalized people so they don't have to pay for like Internet and so on.
35303,PS4,3,95.6,95.72,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,95.88,95.92,0.04,1.0,I.
35303,PS4,3,96.4,106.36,9.96,2.0,"Agree, I think the other opposite one would be for the government to get out of or at least like not interfere in education."
35303,PS4,3,106.68,108.76,2.08,2.0,So they're private schools coming.
35303,PS4,3,108.8,116.28,7.48,2.0,"Oh, I know private schools are thought of as elite, but actually if you but that's just because you usually specify what a school should be like, should have this much area."
35303,PS4,3,116.28,120.08,3.8,2.0,"This world class should be like this, what a teacher student ratio should be like."
35303,PS4,3,120.44,124.04,3.6,2.0,And then only you can have and that's why you have only elite private schools.
35303,PS4,3,124.36,127.0,2.64,2.0,"But if you say no, you can just educate and you've become really an example."
35303,PS4,3,127.0,130.72,3.72,2.0,"It can be a small room with one teacher 400, but at least they're present."
35303,PS4,3,131.36,137.12,5.76,2.0,So the market will provide whatever workable closest solution you have.
35303,PS4,3,137.4,145.48,8.08,3.0,"But it says it's unequal distribution of academic resources, so some people could pay more for like more teachers, more stuff."
35303,PS4,3,146.12,146.92,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, absolutely."
35303,PS4,3,146.92,147.44,0.52,2.0,I agree.
35303,PS4,3,147.44,153.64,6.2,2.0,But I suppose it's a difference between 0 and 100 and let's say 10 and 100.
35303,PS4,3,153.64,155.0,1.36,2.0,So you go from zero to 10.
35303,PS4,3,155.04,157.56,2.52,2.0,"But yes, I agree that the difference."
35303,PS4,3,157.56,160.64,3.08,3.0,"It doesn't like give it, make it blanket equal for everyone."
35303,PS4,3,160.64,161.24,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35303,PS4,3,161.24,161.76,0.52,2.0,I agree.
35303,PS4,3,162.16,162.48,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,162.84,174.44,11.6,1.0,"But the I think that our first solution is quite, quite good because when you have the Internet for everyone and then you just post it online, Yeah, for all the people to access it."
35303,PS4,3,174.64,176.36,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, I think we can like."
35303,PS4,3,177.12,179.32,2.2,2.0,But I worry about how will you give access to info.
35303,PS4,3,179.64,180.8,1.16,2.0,"I mean, I know I came up."
35303,PS4,3,181.04,183.92,2.88,2.0,"I mean, not that I came up, everyone knows it, but like I proposed it."
35303,PS4,3,184.24,185.68,1.44,2.0,But how will you give Internet access?
35303,PS4,3,185.68,185.8,0.12,2.0,OK.
35303,PS4,3,185.92,191.16,5.24,1.0,"So what I was thinking is like the, you know, like a the tower for Signal."
35303,PS4,3,191.16,191.44,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,191.44,194.48,3.04,1.0,"So I think that's what the government should do, Yeah."
35303,PS4,3,194.56,200.12,5.56,1.0,They have to build the towers in every little areas as well so people could get access to it.
35303,PS4,3,200.12,203.56,3.44,1.0,"I mean, I mean, government here should provide for the people, right?"
35303,PS4,3,203.56,204.0,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,204.0,206.12,2.12,1.0,"And I think that's the best thing that they can do, like."
35303,PS4,3,207.84,208.4,0.56,2.0,"Yeah, but let's."
35303,PS4,3,210.12,210.6,0.48,1.0,Say.
35303,PS4,3,211.64,212.48,0.84,3.0,Is it creative?
35303,PS4,3,212.56,213.8,1.24,3.0,Should we go more creative?
35303,PS4,3,213.88,214.4,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I."
35303,PS4,3,214.76,215.0,0.24,3.0,Agree.
35303,PS4,3,215.0,216.08,1.08,3.0,Maybe like something?
35303,PS4,3,219.84,222.68,2.84,1.0,"But yeah, I'm just going to write it down 1st."
35303,PS4,3,223.88,233.72,9.84,2.0,Resources to OK.
35303,PS4,3,233.72,235.76,2.04,2.0,I think the keyword might be different.
35303,PS4,3,235.84,236.0,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,236.0,236.12,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,236.12,245.84,9.72,2.0,"Oh my God, Let it be."
35303,PS4,3,245.92,246.08,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,246.4,246.8,0.4,2.0,So yeah.
35303,PS4,3,249.08,257.0,7.92,1.0,"But if you only get more creative, I think equal, equal distribution, right?"
35303,PS4,3,257.16,257.96,0.8,1.0,So yeah.
35303,PS4,3,259.32,262.2,2.88,3.0,Well something really creative would be just stop educating everyone.
35303,PS4,3,262.24,264.16,1.92,3.0,No resources for anyone that's.
35303,PS4,3,264.24,265.04,0.8,2.0,"True, actually."
35303,PS4,3,265.88,269.12,3.24,1.0,"That's equal, but that's not equal."
35303,PS4,3,269.12,269.32,0.2,1.0,Is not.
35303,PS4,3,269.8,271.92,2.12,3.0,The idea is to overcome inequality.
35303,PS4,3,271.92,274.8,2.88,3.0,It's not to provide education to everyone.
35303,PS4,3,275.56,276.32,0.76,3.0,That's just saying you.
35303,PS4,3,276.6,282.72,6.12,2.0,"Know, but I mean, you can't do it like that would just mean the government not having government schools."
35303,PS4,3,282.72,285.08,2.36,2.0,You can't stop people from educating themselves.
35303,PS4,3,285.16,288.4,3.24,3.0,But are you the government or are we just like?
35303,PS4,3,288.84,289.76,0.92,1.0,"No, I think we can."
35303,PS4,3,289.76,290.6,0.84,3.0,Just a general.
35303,PS4,3,290.6,291.44,0.84,2.0,"No, you can be anyone."
35303,PS4,3,291.44,293.48,2.04,2.0,"But when you say stop education, what does that mean?"
35303,PS4,3,293.64,297.52,3.88,2.0,"Yeah, all that means is that the government from forward education, I can't mean people can't read books anymore."
35303,PS4,3,297.96,298.2,0.24,1.0,"Yeah, sure."
35303,PS4,3,299.12,300.44,1.32,1.0,So they're they're still being the code.
35303,PS4,3,300.48,302.08,1.6,1.0,"Yeah, in a way."
35303,PS4,3,302.4,306.44,4.04,1.0,"I mean, if you're just talking about schools, because I think education is, is more than just schools, right?"
35303,PS4,3,306.48,307.04,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35303,PS4,3,307.16,316.12,8.96,1.0,"That's why we come up with Internet, because those who can't go to school or don't have schools near their near their home, they can just go to the Internet and find their."
35303,PS4,3,316.72,332.68,15.96,2.0,"Space actually, I mean again, none of these I don't think that's the one that solution we should just and the quality because if you would have done it if it was fun, but like I know that URL is some form, I forgot about the term, but basically they have to yeah, exactly."
35303,PS4,3,332.68,335.04,2.36,2.0,They have to have one version of every book published in the UK.
35303,PS4,3,336.48,344.6,8.12,2.0,And so at least I mean more libraries are more and mandate preservation of books would provide people more access to.
35303,PS4,3,344.6,347.16,2.56,3.0,"Yeah, more libraries and online researchers."
35303,PS4,3,348.48,349.88,1.4,3.0,"OK, libraries are great."
35303,PS4,3,350.4,354.08,3.68,1.0,But do you think book is still quite relevant to nowadays?
35303,PS4,3,354.08,359.12,5.04,1.0,I mean like even myself and I are very.
35303,PS4,3,359.52,360.44,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, no, I."
35303,PS4,3,360.56,361.68,1.12,1.0,"I'm in the physical book, right?"
35303,PS4,3,361.76,362.64,0.88,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree."
35303,PS4,3,363.64,373.28,9.64,2.0,"But again, I mean, if you have on, you either don't have an Internet and soft copy problem, in which case you can just provide everything online and you've solved it."
35303,PS4,3,373.4,373.68,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35303,PS4,3,373.76,377.44,3.68,2.0,"Or you do have an Internet and soft copy problem, in which case you have to provide for physical copies."
35303,PS4,3,377.48,378.0,0.52,2.0,Soft copies.
35303,PS4,3,378.68,379.08,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35303,PS4,3,379.08,379.12,0.04,2.0,Oh.
35303,PS4,3,379.88,380.0,0.12,1.0,Well.
35303,PS4,3,381.76,382.48,0.72,3.0,I think this is fine.

34673,PS1,3,114.8,121.84,7.04,1.0,Is it possible to create create a regulation where?
34673,PS1,3,132.68,136.28,3.6,3.0,"For industries, maybe we should taxes increase."
34673,PS1,3,136.28,138.12,1.84,2.0,Tax increase tax.
34673,PS1,3,138.12,142.56,4.44,2.0,"If they use plastic as packaging, it's actually good."
34673,PS1,3,148.6,152.56,3.96,1.0,"Plastic or can be wholly automated, right?"
34673,PS1,3,152.72,155.16,2.44,1.0,I mean to to create the plastic production.
34673,PS1,3,155.64,156.2,0.56,1.0,Is it a?
34673,PS1,3,156.2,157.0,0.8,3.0,Whole.
34673,PS1,3,157.52,161.4,3.88,1.0,"Automatic, automatic process so they don't need much labour."
34673,PS1,3,161.4,171.32,9.92,2.0,"Or if people want to throw away their trash, they will have to pay if they have a plastic trash."
34673,PS1,3,172.96,179.68,6.72,2.0,So they will not buy a plastic 100% because they know that it will be a problem to throw it away.
34673,PS1,3,181.76,182.44,0.68,3.0,Or charge.
34673,PS1,3,183.96,184.32,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
34673,PS1,3,184.96,185.84,0.88,2.0,So either.
34673,PS1,3,186.2,187.56,1.36,1.0,Can we do it the other way around?
34673,PS1,3,187.56,193.52,5.96,1.0,"So if they have plastic and they if they submit it, they get paid."
34673,PS1,3,194.32,194.76,0.44,2.0,But then.
34673,PS1,3,194.92,195.88,0.96,3.0,Then they'll buy more.
34673,PS1,3,195.88,196.68,0.8,2.0,Plastic.
34673,PS1,3,197.04,197.64,0.6,3.0,Do you get the?
34673,PS1,3,197.68,198.04,0.36,2.0,Payments.
34673,PS1,3,198.04,198.84,0.8,2.0,More plastic.
34673,PS1,3,198.92,204.52,5.6,1.0,"But then if it's like, I mean if it's processed correctly, I mean if the plastic waste."
34673,PS1,3,204.52,205.48,0.96,2.0,Is processed.
34673,PS1,3,206.08,206.68,0.6,1.0,Correctly.
34673,PS1,3,208.08,208.36,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
34673,PS1,3,208.76,209.28,0.52,1.0,I don't know.
34673,PS1,3,210.4,216.76,6.36,3.0,"Because otherwise if their disposal takes money, so they won't dispose it off."
34673,PS1,3,217.64,220.48,2.84,2.0,"Yeah, they can use it over and over again."
34673,PS1,3,220.64,220.88,0.24,1.0,"Oh, no."
34673,PS1,3,220.88,224.56,3.68,1.0,"But if they just throw it away, yeah, they can just throw it away in the sea something."
34673,PS1,3,225.4,227.96,2.56,2.0,Like that's true Indonesian behavior.
34673,PS1,3,227.96,231.96,4.0,3.0,"Oh, this can have been plastered Disposal for rewards."
34673,PS1,3,232.16,234.44,2.28,1.0,"Yeah, I think it's, I mean, if we at least want to."
34673,PS1,3,234.44,235.72,1.28,2.0,"Oh, I think Germany has been."
34673,PS1,3,235.76,240.04,4.28,1.0,"Doing that, that's what I'm thinking, like the bottle pasta, they yeah, you can get money, right?"
34673,PS1,3,240.48,241.2,0.72,2.0,Is that creative?
34673,PS1,3,241.44,247.48,6.04,1.0,"Then I don't know if that's if the German is doing no Stinga, how can?"
34673,PS1,3,247.48,254.2,6.72,2.0,We like there are a lot of like recycling programs already.
34673,PS1,3,255.68,258.36,2.68,1.0,How can we just shut down the plastic production?
34673,PS1,3,259.4,275.52,16.12,3.0,"By increasing taxes on the industry, reducing it like if we don't use to incentivize them and we basically are mints, you will be linked to our mints now."
34673,PS1,3,275.68,276.6,0.92,1.0,That's from Germany.
34673,PS1,3,283.68,284.24,0.56,1.0,What is it this?
34673,PS1,3,284.44,296.76,12.32,1.0,"No, because I mean, if, if the, if the demand is still there, if the demand, if the demand is still there, I have to it's OK, the demand is still there."
34673,PS1,3,299.04,299.76,0.72,2.0,"No, it's so good."
34673,PS1,3,302.52,303.68,1.16,1.0,The demand is there.
34673,PS1,3,312.28,312.44,0.16,3.0,No.
34673,PS1,3,312.44,322.2,9.76,3.0,So by increasing taxes for the industry who use plastic or generate plastic one and the customer who buys it has to pay double.
34673,PS1,3,322.88,323.12,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34673,PS1,3,323.12,325.36,2.24,3.0,So like both the legs like demand will reduce.
34673,PS1,3,326.04,327.72,1.68,2.0,So and the employer also both will be.
34673,PS1,3,327.8,328.2,0.4,3.0,Affected.
34673,PS1,3,328.6,328.88,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
34673,PS1,3,328.88,331.24,2.36,2.0,"No one's gonna get incentive from using plastic, Yeah."
34673,PS1,3,333.32,333.84,0.52,3.0,Should I add that?
34673,PS1,3,333.84,334.32,0.48,3.0,"Oh, OK."
34673,PS1,3,334.32,334.44,0.12,3.0,Like.
34673,PS1,3,337.4,338.76,1.36,2.0,Increase text and.
34673,PS1,3,364.96,365.24,0.28,2.0,That's it.
34673,PS1,3,365.52,365.76,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35185,PS5,3,2.08,10.04,7.96,1.0,"Voluntary attrition happens when an employee decides to leave the company, resulting in the reduction of value talent in the workforce."
35185,PS5,3,14.12,16.76,2.64,2.0,Creative idea for this then?
35185,PS5,3,17.92,21.12,3.2,2.0,"Well, this, I mean, this is clearly something that happens all the time, right?"
35185,PS5,3,21.12,25.32,4.2,1.0,"Yeah, but I mean like, and there's so many ways that companies already do this, right, like."
35185,PS5,3,26.16,26.44,0.28,2.0,Right.
35185,PS5,3,27.08,28.88,1.8,1.0,"Yeah, money is one of the OK."
35185,PS5,3,29.4,30.92,1.52,2.0,"But actually, that's not creative, right?"
35185,PS5,3,31.28,32.84,1.56,3.0,"Surely you don't have to write your money down, right?"
35185,PS5,3,32.84,32.96,0.12,3.0,Well.
35185,PS5,3,34.24,36.48,2.24,1.0,"No, the idea is that like if you're a company."
35185,PS5,3,36.52,37.76,1.24,2.0,"Right, Yeah, or it is."
35185,PS5,3,38.16,40.24,2.08,1.0,About money.
35185,PS5,3,41.72,43.56,1.84,1.0,So the money is one of them.
35185,PS5,3,46.28,47.64,1.36,1.0,Another thing is convenience.
35185,PS5,3,49.2,50.96,1.76,2.0,In terms of work from home or?
35185,PS5,3,51.72,52.16,0.44,1.0,No.
35185,PS5,3,52.24,60.12,7.88,1.0,"In terms of food, OK, So some of these stuff like an on site barista."
35185,PS5,3,60.76,62.04,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
35185,PS5,3,62.84,63.92,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35185,PS5,3,63.92,65.08,1.16,2.0,This is getting more creative.
35185,PS5,3,65.08,65.24,0.16,2.0,A gym.
35185,PS5,3,65.48,66.24,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, a gym."
35185,PS5,3,66.76,67.12,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35185,PS5,3,70.96,84.12,13.16,1.0,And then this other thing that I've seen like companies do is they have this like sort of like like thing that they have to where they have to organise like social activities for other people in the company.
35185,PS5,3,94.4,106.0,11.6,1.0,And then you get like sort of like points and like you can get like fast track to the promotion promotion if you do this.
35185,PS5,3,109.08,120.4,11.32,1.0,"So I think like I, I had a friend so looking at McKenzie me, he basically did like these drawing classes for his firm in Bangkok and then that got him like further along."
35185,PS5,3,138.04,144.28,6.24,1.0,"But there's also at the same time improves company culture, And then it feels less like you're going to a job and more like you're going to."
35185,PS5,3,160.68,161.0,0.32,1.0,OK.
35185,PS5,3,163.2,169.68,6.48,1.0,Do you have any other ideas to put some people from leaving?
35185,PS5,3,170.08,172.24,2.16,1.0,I guess it goes on maybe like childcare benefits.
35185,PS5,3,172.64,180.28,7.64,2.0,"Yeah, I think my best at the the convenience route to answer the question."
35185,PS5,3,182.44,197.88,15.44,1.0,"Because yeah, this, these things like especially like the food, it might not like be a lot in terms of how much money you have to spend, but then it would be in the sense that it would be less than maybe like what would be expected in terms of when the pay rise."
35185,PS5,3,213.84,215.84,2.0,2.0,I'm not very creative at this I guess.
35185,PS5,3,216.92,219.16,2.24,2.0,Can we have very structured answers?
35185,PS5,3,225.5,242.06,16.56,1.0,"They also like have this thing where they have like a Development Fund when they get like people like, I don't know, like $200 a month to go and take classes and things like this."
35185,PS5,3,245.76,260.64,14.88,1.0,And then I remember like when this was like cut from like the person's company in question and they basically like quite upset even though that I translated into like 200 more like pounds in the salary.
35185,PS5,3,262.24,272.44,10.2,1.0,"They felt like this and like putting that development was like a way that they felt like they were getting more from work, OK."
35185,PS5,3,279.88,280.96,1.08,2.0,"But we have to pick one, right?"
35185,PS5,3,281.36,283.16,1.8,2.0,So it's not a way to combine.
35185,PS5,3,285.8,287.88,2.08,2.0,I guess that's that's arbitrary.
35185,PS5,3,287.92,290.28,2.36,2.0,We could combine and say this is our one strategy.
35185,PS5,3,290.32,290.8,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, we could."
35185,PS5,3,290.8,296.64,5.84,1.0,We could combine the social activity to convenience because like we could say you can socialise our work instead of having to go out of your way.
35185,PS5,3,299.64,302.56,2.92,2.0,"But technically, you can put development on the convenience as well, right?"
35185,PS5,3,302.72,304.96,2.24,2.0,"If you have yes, yeah, pathways development."
35185,PS5,3,305.16,330.04,24.88,1.0,"Yes, OK, let's let's go with that then, but."
35185,PS5,3,413.64,415.08,1.44,1.0,"Sorry, this is probably not very fun for you."
35185,PS5,3,417.12,454.36,37.24,1.0,This could also offer social activities on site which simultaneously improve company culture and promote skill development.
35185,PS5,3,455.08,455.44,0.36,1.0,OK.
35185,PS5,3,457.96,458.56,0.6,2.0,Thank you.
35185,PS5,3,467.04,469.6,2.56,2.0,That's fine.
36132,PS4,3,2.0,2.44,0.44,1.0,It's your.
36132,PS4,3,2.44,3.4,0.96,1.0,It's your specialty.
36132,PS4,3,3.4,3.64,0.24,1.0,It's not.
36132,PS4,3,5.08,5.88,0.8,2.0,Educational.
36132,PS4,3,7.68,15.12,7.44,2.0,I don't want to create the idea to overcome inequality.
36132,PS4,3,15.44,16.12,0.68,3.0,In education.
36132,PS4,3,16.24,17.84,1.6,3.0,Equality in education.
36132,PS4,3,19.32,20.36,1.04,1.0,Different idea.
36132,PS4,3,26.76,27.68,0.92,2.0,Created by the.
36132,PS4,3,42.21,53.81,11.6,1.0,"Remember, like in COVID, basically like because so many children, so many school children actually don't have like access to digital devices in some more rural areas in the UK, they actually have funding for them, something like that."
36132,PS4,3,53.81,54.33,0.52,1.0,It's not creative.
36132,PS4,3,54.33,55.33,1.0,1.0,So there's just a starting point.
36132,PS4,3,55.93,60.41,4.48,1.0,"And then it ends up actually they because you buy those things and then they, they still don't know how to use them."
36132,PS4,3,60.53,65.01,4.48,1.0,The teachers don't know how to use the computers for like soon meetings and stuff.
36132,PS4,3,66.04,66.48,0.44,2.0,That's also.
36132,PS4,3,66.6,67.96,1.36,1.0,The problem that's also the problem.
36132,PS4,3,67.96,77.04,9.08,1.0,"So because like education in college can also be like, because in these, these disadvantage or marginalized groups are also located in areas with less resources."
36132,PS4,3,77.68,78.96,1.28,1.0,So yeah.
36132,PS4,3,79.08,86.36,7.28,1.0,"And then it's like cross generational basically because they, they also see themselves like, oh, I'm being taught by these teachers who are unsuccessful."
36132,PS4,3,86.6,87.96,1.36,1.0,So why do I want to succeed?
36132,PS4,3,90.32,91.92,1.6,3.0,I I come up with with one thing.
36132,PS4,3,91.92,92.12,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36132,PS4,3,92.12,97.16,5.04,3.0,"So we can make like bus school or something, some school that's can be moved."
36132,PS4,3,97.16,104.36,7.2,3.0,And so this school can like can go to see the marginalized group.
36132,PS4,3,104.52,104.72,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36132,PS4,3,105.28,107.24,1.96,1.0,Because like create create schools.
36132,PS4,3,108.2,109.04,0.84,3.0,That's can be moved.
36132,PS4,3,109.48,110.48,1.0,1.0,"Yeah, label them."
36132,PS4,3,110.48,111.0,0.52,1.0,Label them.
36132,PS4,3,111.0,111.96,0.96,1.0,It's a creative solution.
36132,PS4,3,112.08,112.76,0.68,1.0,It's it's not.
36132,PS4,3,113.12,113.96,0.84,2.0,How is it?
36132,PS4,3,113.96,114.44,0.48,1.0,Labeled label.
36132,PS4,3,114.44,114.8,0.36,1.0,"No, no."
36132,PS4,3,114.8,115.88,1.08,1.0,I mean it's kind of a labeling.
36132,PS4,3,115.88,117.56,1.68,1.0,It's like it's an intended labeling.
36132,PS4,3,117.56,124.16,6.6,1.0,"In fact, if you put all the disadvantage and marginalized group into a school together and they were, yeah, you can, you can make, you can make that happen."
36132,PS4,3,124.16,126.8,2.64,1.0,I don't know how ethical that sounds for you.
36132,PS4,3,126.8,127.12,0.32,1.0,That sounds.
36132,PS4,3,128.36,129.08,0.72,2.0,Really worrying.
36132,PS4,3,129.08,130.56,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, it sounds very concerning."
36132,PS4,3,130.56,130.84,0.28,1.0,It sounds.
36132,PS4,3,132.2,132.88,0.68,2.0,Really concerning.
36132,PS4,3,133.04,135.6,2.56,1.0,And also like it's really hard usually I think I was a teacher.
36132,PS4,3,135.6,145.2,9.6,1.0,"So if we have late marginalized group, like if we have a school like that, it's it's almost unteachable in a way because it's like all of the people would have got problems."
36132,PS4,3,145.52,150.44,4.92,1.0,And we will take a lot of effort to discipline everyone or like to give them opportunities and encourage everyone.
36132,PS4,3,150.48,153.16,2.68,1.0,And it's really hard to cultivate that kind of learning environment.
36132,PS4,3,154.0,154.24,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36132,PS4,3,155.4,163.96,8.56,1.0,"Whereas when you have disadvantage groups actually looking at like, oh, like these people are also doing great and they just want to work a little harder together with this apart from the peers."
36132,PS4,3,164.96,166.68,1.72,1.0,"OK, sorry, I think we're drifting back."
36132,PS4,3,166.68,168.92,2.24,1.0,"No, no, no, it's your specialty."
36132,PS4,3,168.92,169.84,0.92,1.0,It's your specialty like.
36132,PS4,3,170.24,177.08,6.84,2.0,"I would say like, yeah, like the billions of dollars we're putting into building AI infrastructure in the US we can use."
36132,PS4,3,177.2,179.12,1.92,1.0,"It yeah to this, yeah."
36132,PS4,3,179.84,181.16,1.32,1.0,So tax to rich basically.
36132,PS4,3,181.16,181.52,0.36,2.0,Tax.

36132,PS4,3,203.32,208.32,5.0,1.0,"AI won't come up with this answer because because they're comparing answers with AI, right?"
36132,PS4,3,208.4,208.6,0.2,1.0,Yes.
36132,PS4,3,209.72,209.96,0.24,2.0,And AI.

36132,PS4,3,246.16,284.64,38.48,2.0,Tags AI companies and that the Centers for their environmental impact and then you have this whole circle with the other problem and use that money to for academic sources or.
36132,PS4,3,291.76,298.96,7.2,1.0,And I'm told that they can also force these AI companies to to teach these marginal script how to use AI or something.
36132,PS4,3,300.6,300.84,0.24,1.0,Can we?
36132,PS4,3,301.56,301.92,0.36,2.0,Yeah.

36132,PS4,3,314.04,315.16,1.12,1.0,You can just do a shift right?
36132,PS4,3,315.8,318.4,2.6,2.0,"Oh yeah, I'm not used to do that."
36132,PS4,3,320.56,321.16,0.6,2.0,You have a point.
36132,PS4,3,325.16,334.56,9.4,2.0,Enforce AI capability.
36132,PS4,3,334.56,337.36,2.8,2.0,No capability AI skills.
36132,PS4,3,337.44,338.16,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, Skills, yeah."

36132,PS4,3,351.92,361.72,9.8,2.0,"Well, but it's more like enforce that, yeah, companies have to teach."
36132,PS4,3,365.16,385.76,20.6,2.0,We have to use resources to teach are generalized groups and teachers AI skills for the future of work.
36132,PS4,3,396.8,399.8,3.0,1.0,Sources to teach teachers.
36132,PS4,3,399.84,401.36,1.52,1.0,Teachers work?
36132,PS4,3,401.36,405.6,4.24,1.0,"Yeah, definitely not happening."
36132,PS4,3,409.6,410.72,1.12,2.0,But you should like.
36132,PS4,3,412.4,413.48,1.08,1.0,Because they're earning so much.

36132,PS4,3,418.2,425.56,7.36,3.0,"Yeah, and there is a more environmental myth is there is more environmental effect than everyone can see."
36132,PS4,3,425.56,432.92,7.36,3.0,"Yeah, like every, every time we acquisition in the charity is key a lot of carbon emission like."
36132,PS4,3,433.12,433.44,0.32,1.0,"Oh, really?"
36132,PS4,3,433.44,434.68,1.24,1.0,Even if we ask questions?
36132,PS4,3,434.84,435.08,0.24,1.0,Oh.
36132,PS4,3,435.12,440.12,5.0,3.0,"Yeah, because everything use use computer use data center, but when?"
36132,PS4,3,440.32,440.72,0.4,2.0,You that's.
36132,PS4,3,440.96,441.08,0.12,3.0,True.
36132,PS4,3,441.12,443.96,2.84,3.0,"Yeah, no one know what is behind this website video."
36132,PS4,3,443.96,444.6,0.64,3.0,"Yeah, actually."
36132,PS4,3,445.0,447.68,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, they, they, they won't disclose the data, of course."
36132,PS4,3,447.72,448.4,0.68,1.0,Like how much?
36132,PS4,3,449.4,449.48,0.08,3.0,They.
36132,PS4,3,449.68,460.76,11.08,2.0,Disclose an estimate of carbon emissions and hogging face have done like kind of trying to estimate the carbon emissions.
36132,PS4,3,461.96,467.16,5.2,1.0,There's a training and then the computation for like processing as well and then maybe they will be training the.
36132,PS4,3,467.16,467.68,0.52,2.0,Training is the.
36132,PS4,3,467.68,469.16,1.48,1.0,"Most is the most, yeah."
36132,PS4,3,469.36,471.84,2.48,2.0,"Resource intensive part, but still like."
36132,PS4,3,472.84,477.6,4.76,1.0,"The, but I'm quite sure they retrain the system constantly with our with the new data or something as well."
36132,PS4,3,477.6,487.84,10.24,1.0,"So not to mention they also explore it like workforces from third world, third world to yeah, to review like AI answers label, you know like data annotation."
36132,PS4,3,487.84,488.28,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, that's OK."
36132,PS4,3,488.96,489.56,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, OK, all."
36132,PS4,3,491.48,491.72,0.24,1.0,Right.
36387,PS4,3,7.96,16.96,9.0,1.0,"Educational inequality is the unequal distribution of economic resources to disadvantages, disadvantaged and marginalized groups."
36387,PS4,3,17.32,20.84,3.52,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to overcome inequality in an equation.
36387,PS4,3,20.92,21.36,0.44,1.0,Great.
36387,PS4,3,28.96,30.84,1.88,2.0,An equal distribution.
36387,PS4,3,31.08,32.64,1.56,3.0,Academical resources.
36387,PS4,3,39.92,42.44,2.52,3.0,"I guess one of the key issues is right access, right?"
36387,PS4,3,42.56,48.08,5.52,1.0,"Yeah, access to quality physical interest also can be."
36387,PS4,3,50.6,51.6,1.0,2.0,So what would that be?
36387,PS4,3,52.32,53.64,1.32,1.0,1st we can change from the Internet.
36387,PS4,3,54.44,67.72,13.28,2.0,"I think providing like study groups, like free study groups of students to like join where like they're all like learning the same thing, that type of thing."
36387,PS4,3,68.0,71.12,3.12,2.0,"Like they've all got the same like syllabus, but like it's free of course."
36387,PS4,3,71.12,75.08,3.96,2.0,"So it's open to everyone, that type of thing."
36387,PS4,3,75.48,77.8,2.32,3.0,"We need to be like in person, like it."
36387,PS4,3,78.16,85.04,6.88,2.0,"Could be like in person online, but I'd much rather be in person because not everyone has got access to like a computer and that type of thing."
36387,PS4,3,85.28,85.72,0.44,3.0,Exactly.
36387,PS4,3,86.0,96.76,10.76,3.0,"I mean that's, that's the way to trade off like digital platforms for education or overcome geographical kind of boundaries that people experience."
36387,PS4,3,96.76,100.16,3.4,3.0,But at the same time then it can be kind of a financial component to it.
36387,PS4,3,100.68,103.52,2.84,3.0,"You don't have computer, don't have Internet."
36387,PS4,3,104.16,110.4,6.24,3.0,So that's it's kind of like a trade off One has overcome geographical other ones requires a certain level of resources.
36387,PS4,3,110.8,111.96,1.16,1.0,Economic viability right now.
36387,PS4,3,112.16,112.56,0.4,3.0,Yeah.
36387,PS4,3,113.68,114.12,0.44,1.0,"OK, so."
36387,PS4,3,119.92,120.4,0.48,1.0,What else?
36387,PS4,3,120.4,122.96,2.56,1.0,"We have 10 minutes, so we still we can discuss a few more things."
36387,PS4,3,125.8,128.96,3.16,1.0,So idea is to come up with a normal idea.
36387,PS4,3,129.64,130.04,0.4,2.0,And.
36387,PS4,3,130.76,133.68,2.92,1.0,"We are supposed to be something better than AI models, so."
36387,PS4,3,135.76,149.56,13.8,3.0,"If we're going to go with like an in person, like, let's say group educational workshop, maybe ideally some, it could be something this is thinking outside the box, something mobile."
36387,PS4,3,149.88,162.24,12.36,3.0,"You know how like during COVID-19, there could be like vaccination kind of buses that would go to certain communities that were having like poor access to to vaccination rates."
36387,PS4,3,162.24,177.6,15.36,3.0,"So maybe you could have like a big RV, it goes to certain areas and children and people in the community can just just attend this said well and, you know, learn certain things that are very kind of important for their education development."
36387,PS4,3,177.6,184.12,6.52,3.0,So it's it's bringing the educational opportunities to them as removing the issues around accessibility.
36387,PS4,3,184.6,187.12,2.52,3.0,"Yeah, it's an idea like a big fan."
36387,PS4,3,187.4,189.76,2.36,3.0,The classroom inside it's mobile goes to different.
36387,PS4,3,189.76,190.04,0.28,1.0,Areas.
36387,PS4,3,190.04,191.8,1.76,1.0,"So mobile classroom, yeah."
36387,PS4,3,191.8,192.52,0.72,3.0,Exactly.
36387,PS4,3,194.36,209.68,15.32,1.0,"Mobile classroom for basic education, because it can't be specific to some women because if we are, well, this question is quite generally so education inequalities, the unequal distribution of equity resources."
36387,PS4,3,210.6,210.84,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36387,PS4,3,210.84,211.96,1.12,1.0,So it's about resources.
36387,PS4,3,211.96,216.24,4.28,1.0,So we can think of this like mobile plans.
36387,PS4,3,217.64,217.96,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
36387,PS4,3,218.0,220.4,2.4,1.0,Like mobile classroom classroom on the videos.
36387,PS4,3,222.08,230.96,8.88,2.0,"That that's probably the most creative idea because besides that the most like obvious ones, ensuring that all schools are like equally funded so."
36387,PS4,3,231.76,232.2,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
36387,PS4,3,234.8,246.8,12.0,3.0,"In addition to like being like a a moving classroom, we're going to be something like a like a bit of like a moving library and resources can be given out freely as well."
36387,PS4,3,247.4,253.96,6.56,1.0,So please come up with one creative idea to overcome educational inequality in ASID inequality inequality.
36387,PS4,3,254.16,264.92,10.76,1.0,"There can be something more like those who have access to resources, they can donate certain things to research and taste people."
36387,PS4,3,265.48,287.52,22.04,1.0,"Because sometimes if you are from say well off in terms of educational resources, then we can think of transfer of resources as well just for idea, because we have time and brainstorm more."
36387,PS4,3,288.92,296.2,7.28,3.0,"I mean, that could maybe if we're trying to connect ideas, we could take that that that's partially funded through charitable donations."
36387,PS4,3,296.8,311.44,14.64,3.0,"So it's a moving classroom that goes to marginalized, underrepresented communities and have like poorer access to high quality education and part of its funding can come from people that have the capacity."
36387,PS4,3,311.44,312.24,0.8,2.0,To donate.
36387,PS4,3,312.64,313.56,0.92,3.0,So you kind of.
36387,PS4,3,313.8,314.76,0.96,2.0,Get the best of both parts.
36387,PS4,3,314.76,315.52,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36387,PS4,3,316.08,316.2,0.12,2.0,OK.
36387,PS4,3,318.12,333.84,15.72,2.0,So that will be mobile classrooms or or funded through.
36387,PS4,3,346.88,348.64,1.76,2.0,For donations from.
36387,PS4,3,353.88,359.6,5.72,3.0,"From, you know, citizens and communities that have financial resources."
36387,PS4,3,366.72,369.36,2.64,1.0,So I think we need to make it clear like what is mobile?
36387,PS4,3,369.36,370.04,0.68,3.0,Exactly.
36387,PS4,3,370.12,372.88,2.76,3.0,"Yeah, maybe more description like a mobile classroom."
36387,PS4,3,372.88,379.32,6.44,3.0,It's like a almost a a large bus that's almost been gutted aside and turned into a classroom.
36387,PS4,3,382.2,382.72,0.52,3.0,Yeah.
36387,PS4,3,384.08,386.04,1.96,1.0,I think we have such facility.
36387,PS4,3,387.04,389.16,2.12,1.0,I have heard of it like mobile library.
36387,PS4,3,389.92,390.28,0.36,3.0,So that.
36387,PS4,3,390.44,391.32,0.88,1.0,When we.
36387,PS4,3,391.56,392.04,0.48,3.0,Travel.
36387,PS4,3,392.08,394.2,2.12,1.0,To the remote areas and to be 10.
36387,PS4,3,394.24,395.0,0.76,3.0,Or maybe Saturday.
36387,PS4,3,395.0,396.12,1.12,3.0,"Sundays, yeah."
36387,PS4,3,397.84,400.56,2.72,1.0,And then they will notice that.
36387,PS4,3,401.08,403.56,2.48,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, that's good."
36387,PS4,3,404.2,406.32,2.12,3.0,Basically thing of like an ice cream.
36387,PS4,3,407.2,407.52,0.32,1.0,Yeah.

36387,PS4,3,433.28,436.4,3.12,1.0,To do listen from people from the community who are financially capable.
36387,PS4,3,436.8,437.56,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36387,PS4,3,438.2,446.72,8.52,3.0,"You know, we have one thing maybe I should explain children and."
36387,PS4,3,450.68,450.84,0.16,1.0,Young.
36387,PS4,3,452.16,474.64,22.48,3.0,People from disadvantaged communities can automatically join these mobile classes.
36387,PS4,3,475.32,498.76,23.44,3.0,Maybe I should just say these mobile classrooms will specifically drive my spelling.
36387,PS4,3,498.76,499.2,0.44,3.0,Oh my God.
36387,PS4,3,502.48,519.52,17.04,3.0,Park in can I say deprived communities and children and young people from from these disadvised community advisory.

35452,PS5,3,46.72,47.08,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35452,PS5,3,47.6,69.44,21.84,2.0,So my idea is question for like you just raise a salary or we just like give more organizational support to a certain employee so that they will feel that they are affiliated with this organization and they may have effective commitment or even normal commitments I think.
35452,PS5,3,71.52,75.68,4.16,3.0,"Yes, I think we need to know the reason why he want to leave."
35452,PS5,3,76.96,77.24,0.28,1.0,And.
35452,PS5,3,77.92,86.52,8.6,3.0,Based on his reason and we give some like ideas like benefits or something like related to his.
35452,PS5,3,86.52,86.92,0.4,2.0,Reason.
35452,PS5,3,87.0,87.16,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35452,PS5,3,87.16,94.52,7.36,2.0,"So like a feedback system, like when they leave the organization, we ask for their feedback so that we can improve on the second point."
35452,PS5,3,95.56,97.48,1.92,1.0,"Yeah, I think same for me."
35452,PS5,3,97.48,111.36,13.88,1.0,I think maybe we should have check insurance maybe like twice a year or depending on the frequency that people live and check whether they how they're feeling in general towards the organization and why.
35452,PS5,3,111.8,116.96,5.16,1.0,"And from the feedback, we'll be able to find out like why people leave and improve on that aspect."
35452,PS5,3,120.72,121.96,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, maybe we'll just turn it down."
35452,PS5,3,169.11,169.47,0.36,1.0,You know.
35452,PS5,3,171.59,172.79,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, good to me actually."
35452,PS5,3,174.55,174.83,0.28,1.0,OK.
35213,PS5,3,1.76,5.84,4.08,1.0,Volunteer attribution happen when an employee decides to resulting.
35213,PS5,3,17.3,17.78,0.48,2.0,Big money.
35213,PS5,3,23.5,25.14,1.64,2.0,What is the attrition?
35213,PS5,3,25.26,27.34,2.08,2.0,Do you know the meaning of the?
35213,PS5,3,27.66,28.18,0.52,3.0,Attrition.
35213,PS5,3,28.18,32.06,3.88,1.0,"Attrition means retain, I think retaining, retaining the employees, yeah."
35213,PS5,3,32.9,46.0,13.1,2.0,Creative idea in my previous company if they want to retain their employee like they give the three times monthly salary.
35213,PS5,3,46.96,48.2,1.24,1.0,"Oh, how does that work?"
35213,PS5,3,48.48,48.92,0.44,1.0,Three times.
35213,PS5,3,48.92,49.04,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35213,PS5,3,49.12,49.32,0.2,1.0,So.
35213,PS5,3,49.32,51.24,1.92,1.0,"So if my voice sit out there, I'm gonna leave."
35213,PS5,3,51.24,52.56,1.32,1.0,Then I'll get the three times.
35213,PS5,3,52.68,54.2,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, some of my friends get it."
35213,PS5,3,55.04,58.44,3.4,3.0,"And then everyone will ask for, yeah, still get the triple salary."
35213,PS5,3,58.88,61.24,2.36,2.0,But not everyone will get it.
35213,PS5,3,61.48,62.52,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, will get it."
35213,PS5,3,62.56,62.8,0.24,3.0,Only.
35213,PS5,3,62.8,72.24,9.44,2.0,Like the item top performer I see and mostly the top performer already over get the over from the other company really well for example.
35213,PS5,3,72.24,79.56,7.32,2.0,So they cancel or didn't take the offer from the company with the three months already?
35213,PS5,3,80.72,81.92,1.2,1.0,It's a it's like a risk.
35213,PS5,3,83.44,84.16,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, If you if you should."
35213,PS5,3,85.08,85.88,0.8,2.0,Come up with any.
35213,PS5,3,86.84,87.0,0.16,3.0,Other.
35213,PS5,3,110.0,114.68,4.68,2.0,"So we should make people stop leaving the company, something like that."
35213,PS5,3,157.17,158.41,1.24,2.0,Getting a holiday trip?
35213,PS5,3,159.37,159.97,0.6,3.0,Holiday.
35213,PS5,3,160.21,160.69,0.48,2.0,"Holiday, holiday."
35213,PS5,3,161.13,161.33,0.2,3.0,Trip.
35213,PS5,3,164.65,166.37,1.72,3.0,So I think they asked to leave the company.
35213,PS5,3,166.37,168.49,2.12,3.0,The company will pay for a holiday trip for this.
35213,PS5,3,168.93,172.77,3.84,3.0,Let them think about this their decision again before they leave the company.
35213,PS5,3,173.69,184.52,10.83,1.0,"Yeah, getting given like, yeah, like before they leave anything before compulsory holiday trip, then it's sponsored by the company."
35213,PS5,3,184.52,186.88,2.36,3.0,The compulsory for them to do a trip before you leave the company.
35213,PS5,3,187.32,188.8,1.48,1.0,So you can brainwash them to.
35213,PS5,3,188.8,189.0,0.2,1.0,I don't.
35213,PS5,3,189.32,194.12,4.8,3.0,Know just.
35213,PS5,3,195.88,210.6,14.72,1.0,Compulsory holiday sponsored by the company before anyone can leave.
35213,PS5,3,213.16,215.0,1.84,3.0,And what they should do during the trip.
35213,PS5,3,217.52,222.88,5.36,1.0,"During the trip, company will bring more."
35213,PS5,3,229.56,230.16,0.6,3.0,Yeah.
35213,PS5,3,235.8,236.64,0.84,1.0,True.
35213,PS5,3,238.32,241.12,2.8,2.0,Giving giving the how to say GIF.
35213,PS5,3,241.32,242.84,1.52,1.0,"Yeah, true private for."
35213,PS5,3,244.28,244.88,0.6,2.0,Example there's.
35213,PS5,3,245.08,245.56,0.48,3.0,A box?
35213,PS5,3,245.56,247.6,2.04,3.0,"Yeah, OK."
35213,PS5,3,247.64,247.76,0.12,2.0,OK.
35213,PS5,3,258.36,258.48,0.12,3.0,Cool.
36489,PS2,6,0.28,1.56,1.28,1.0,Let's do this thing and you have a.
36489,PS2,6,2.88,11.64,8.76,2.0,"Yeah, so vulnerabilities within the supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficiently reschedules."
36489,PS2,6,11.96,15.32,3.36,2.0,Please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security loss.
36489,PS2,6,15.56,16.08,0.52,2.0,Can you read it?
36489,PS2,6,16.8,17.08,0.28,3.0,Again.
36489,PS2,6,17.64,17.8,0.16,2.0,Please.
36489,PS2,6,17.8,26.24,8.44,2.0,Vulnerabilities within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
36489,PS2,6,26.52,30.48,3.96,2.0,"Please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security, OK?"
36489,PS2,6,32.12,33.36,1.24,3.0,So let's understand it.
36489,PS2,6,33.56,34.96,1.4,2.0,Does it say there's OK actually?
36489,PS2,6,35.56,40.48,4.92,4.0,"Some of my my department, they're doing research of the resilience of supply."
36489,PS2,6,41.12,41.56,0.44,2.0,"Chain, OK."
36489,PS2,6,41.96,56.12,14.16,4.0,"So actually they just some basic research is just to collect data from, you know, the historic data like the the weather and the the transaction cost."
36489,PS2,6,56.28,57.0,0.72,2.0,"OK, for."
36489,PS2,6,57.6,69.44,11.84,4.0,Specific industry then it uses things historical data to try to forecast and you know use some latest data to check is the forecast to check the accuracy.
36489,PS2,6,69.72,70.64,0.92,2.0,Of the forecast second that's.
36489,PS2,6,71.68,73.28,1.6,4.0,That's one one.
36489,PS2,6,73.48,73.8,0.32,2.0,Potential.
36489,PS2,6,74.04,74.44,0.4,2.0,OK.
36489,PS2,6,74.56,78.48,3.92,2.0,"So what's creative idea could we use to tackle supply chain security, I think?"
36489,PS2,6,79.44,80.32,0.88,4.0,It's like.
36489,PS2,6,80.76,81.52,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, the forecast."
36489,PS2,6,81.52,81.8,0.28,3.0,So we.
36489,PS2,6,81.8,82.64,0.84,2.0,"Could just forecast, yeah."
36489,PS2,6,82.64,83.96,1.32,3.0,Make it focus to collect some historical.
36489,PS2,6,84.6,84.76,0.16,4.0,Data.
36489,PS2,6,86.48,87.8,1.32,2.0,"And OK, so how do I say it?"
36489,PS2,6,87.88,88.72,0.84,2.0,Just talk it.
36489,PS2,6,88.72,89.24,0.52,2.0,Let me type.
36489,PS2,6,90.24,90.76,0.52,5.0,Exactly.
36489,PS2,6,90.76,91.36,0.6,5.0,Do you want to type it?
36489,PS2,6,91.36,92.0,0.64,5.0,Because I didn't.
36489,PS2,6,96.64,96.8,0.16,4.0,Want.
36489,PS2,6,96.8,99.12,2.32,3.0,"To because it's, yeah."
36489,PS2,6,101.56,101.68,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
36489,PS2,6,103.48,104.0,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, weather."
36489,PS2,6,104.32,105.16,0.84,2.0,It's just one one.
36489,PS2,6,105.68,106.56,0.88,4.0,11
36489,PS2,6,108.44,109.88,1.44,2.0,"Yeah, and creative idea."
36489,PS2,6,117.36,117.44,0.08,4.0,So.
36489,PS2,6,122.24,123.72,1.48,3.0,Like whether historical data?
36489,PS2,6,123.72,125.72,2.0,4.0,"Or yeah, yeah."
36489,PS2,6,125.72,150.72,25.0,4.0,"And also there are some like transaction costs if like if for example, the freight cost if we want to, yeah, to send our products to another country, that's another idea, but."
36489,PS2,6,153.28,161.48,8.2,3.0,"You know what she's saying is when you get historic theaters, Yeah."
36489,PS2,6,163.0,164.48,1.48,3.0,So they are all good ideas.
36489,PS2,6,164.6,165.6,1.0,3.0,You just have to write them.
36489,PS2,6,170.36,172.52,2.16,4.0,And it doesn't mean that it does maintain that supply and change.
36489,PS2,6,199.64,200.44,0.8,4.0,"Yes, I think."
36489,PS2,6,203.16,207.24,4.08,2.0,We can collect some historical data and use this data set to train models.
36489,PS2,6,207.56,210.04,2.48,2.0,These models can help us forecast the future trend.
36489,PS2,6,210.04,213.56,3.52,2.0,The forecast results can also be verified by the latest data does.
36489,PS2,6,213.56,213.68,0.12,5.0,That.
36489,PS2,6,213.68,213.84,0.16,2.0,Work.
36489,PS2,6,213.84,213.96,0.12,5.0,For.
36489,PS2,6,213.96,214.36,0.4,2.0,Everyone.
36489,PS2,6,214.84,216.0,1.16,6.0,Because I don't understand the question.
36196,PS2,6,34.47,35.51,1.04,1.0,It was very general.
36196,PS2,6,56.04,56.92,0.88,2.0,I'm thinking use more.
36196,PS2,6,56.92,58.72,1.8,1.0,"Robots, but I don't know how creative that."
36196,PS2,6,58.72,61.76,3.04,3.0,Is what type of vulnerabilities?
36196,PS2,6,62.08,63.08,1.0,2.0,It's so general.
36196,PS2,6,63.08,64.44,1.36,2.0,"It's so general, yeah."
36196,PS2,6,98.98,104.1,5.12,3.0,I'm wondering what do you study in in in university because my my subject is.
36196,PS2,6,105.66,106.7,1.04,4.0,So distant.
36196,PS2,6,107.98,110.34,2.36,3.0,From I studied 19th century French.
36196,PS2,6,115.96,118.76,2.8,1.0,Does anyone do like business or something we're in?
36196,PS2,6,118.76,119.32,0.56,1.0,Is there a business?
36196,PS2,6,119.68,121.68,2.0,3.0,"Sense of how, what what this?"
36196,PS2,6,121.92,123.64,1.72,2.0,Conception is yeah.
36196,PS2,6,125.84,128.28,2.44,1.0,Anyone does business economics.
36196,PS2,6,128.36,129.2,0.84,1.0,"Oh, oh, you're embarrassed."
36196,PS2,6,131.44,132.44,1.0,1.0,You're the closest thing.
36196,PS2,6,136.68,157.52,20.84,3.0,"So what I think of supply chains, not that I think of supply chains often, but I think of like maybe transport inefficiencies, like, you know, stuff like, you know, wars could affect that and political kind of factors can affect how supply chains operate and stuff like thinking about like the war like in Ukraine and stuff like that."
36196,PS2,6,158.64,163.16,4.52,3.0,"So it really just depends on the type of vulnerabilities, I guess."
36196,PS2,6,163.16,166.12,2.96,3.0,Maybe you just have to pick something and find decisions.
36196,PS2,6,166.44,166.8,0.36,2.0,OK.
36196,PS2,6,167.6,173.92,6.32,2.0,"So we find one vulnerability to tackle and then we just, yeah, that's not a good idea because I was thinking of like transport as well."
36196,PS2,6,174.12,175.2,1.08,1.0,Which transport can we do?
36196,PS2,6,175.2,176.72,1.52,1.0,"Like, I don't know."
36196,PS2,6,176.72,182.8,6.08,1.0,"I keep thinking of like drones and stuff, but yeah, like, how creative is that?"
36196,PS2,6,182.8,183.28,0.48,1.0,I don't know.
36196,PS2,6,184.4,190.36,5.96,3.0,Are we operating within about like practicality or are we just like being very imaginative and.
36196,PS2,6,190.44,190.64,0.2,2.0,Like.
36196,PS2,6,190.8,192.64,1.84,5.0,"Ignoring reality, I think imaginative it's."
36196,PS2,6,192.8,193.16,0.36,3.0,It's OK.
36196,PS2,6,193.56,194.88,1.32,2.0,Because is it creative?
36196,PS2,6,195.52,197.08,1.56,3.0,"Yeah, because I like the idea of drones."
36196,PS2,6,197.48,199.08,1.6,3.0,So that's kind of futuristic.
36196,PS2,6,199.4,199.48,0.08,2.0,I'm.
36196,PS2,6,201.24,210.64,9.4,4.0,"Talking about transport, I, I think of an example is about the traffic, jet traffic jam when they're transporting it."
36196,PS2,6,211.28,221.2,9.92,4.0,"And in China they are using this, they're using the subway at off peak hour so that they can skip the transport."
36196,PS2,6,221.24,223.84,2.6,4.0,I think that's kind of a creative idea.
36196,PS2,6,225.44,228.2,2.76,5.0,So we are assuming it's transportation vulnerability.
36196,PS2,6,228.56,228.84,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36196,PS2,6,229.56,230.56,1.0,1.0,"Yes, sure."
36196,PS2,6,232.28,235.12,2.84,5.0,But do you think we should like create something that is more general or?
36196,PS2,6,235.12,237.04,1.92,3.0,We can focus on transport.
36196,PS2,6,237.36,239.44,2.08,2.0,But I feel like if you try to tackle it from.
36196,PS2,6,239.44,240.32,0.88,1.0,Such a general.
36196,PS2,6,240.92,243.08,2.16,2.0,Point of view then it's really hard to focus.
36196,PS2,6,243.08,243.28,0.2,1.0,On the.
36196,PS2,6,243.28,243.88,0.6,2.0,Solution.
36196,PS2,6,244.28,245.48,1.2,3.0,"OK, that's fine."
36196,PS2,6,246.32,249.6,3.28,2.0,"OK, Yeah, we can so transport, but then what was our solution?"
36196,PS2,6,249.6,253.68,4.08,2.0,Would we do like the subway then or would we do the drone or are?
36196,PS2,6,253.68,254.36,0.68,1.0,We going to think of.
36196,PS2,6,315.56,320.96,5.4,2.0,"The train idea is not about, you know, I think because first like the need to run it anyway."
36196,PS2,6,321.24,328.64,7.4,2.0,So like you're not wasting that electricity if it's like empty And so we can say.
36196,PS2,6,328.64,330.8,2.16,1.0,It from an environmental point of view from like a.
36196,PS2,6,330.8,331.44,0.64,2.0,Cost point.
36196,PS2,6,331.44,332.0,0.56,1.0,Of view like.
36196,PS2,6,333.08,333.36,0.28,3.0,We can.
36196,PS2,6,334.44,335.48,1.04,2.0,Go off the train idea.
36196,PS2,6,335.64,336.56,0.92,2.0,Does anyone want to type?
36196,PS2,6,337.48,338.52,1.04,1.0,"Well, I guess I'm the closest."
36196,PS2,6,338.52,339.72,1.2,1.0,I will try my best to reach it.
36196,PS2,6,339.8,340.04,0.24,1.0,Hold on.
36196,PS2,6,346.48,350.64,4.16,2.0,"OK, so how should we start so tackling from a transportation?"
36196,PS2,6,351.08,351.96,0.88,1.0,"Oh my gosh, I need to go."
36196,PS2,6,353.56,354.72,1.16,4.0,I just have a solution.
36196,PS2,6,354.72,358.76,4.04,4.0,We can also explain how does that tackle the course and efficiency.
36196,PS2,6,359.04,360.92,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, OK, that works."
36196,PS2,6,363.48,368.08,4.6,2.0,So from a transportation low.
36196,PS2,6,375.68,378.64,2.96,2.0,"Tackling, tackling the transportation vulnerability."
36196,PS2,6,378.68,379.0,0.32,2.0,No.
36196,PS2,6,379.6,384.24,4.64,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
36196,PS2,6,384.36,406.44,22.08,2.0,"We can tackle tackle inefficiency and costs, uncontrolled costs by delivering."
36196,PS2,6,406.96,407.44,0.48,2.0,"No, yeah."
36196,PS2,6,411.28,411.6,0.32,3.0,OK.
36196,PS2,6,414.16,420.12,5.96,2.0,And cargo and shipment items no.
36196,PS2,6,420.28,441.52,21.24,2.0,"Yeah, shipment items by by delivering via off peak, trains by via trains during or train slash the subway during off peak."
36196,PS2,6,442.96,444.28,1.32,2.0,Is anyone here a lawyer?
36196,PS2,6,445.28,445.8,0.52,4.0,We might have.
36196,PS2,6,446.6,447.36,0.76,1.0,I'm thinking.
36196,PS2,6,448.0,448.12,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36196,PS2,6,451.24,452.64,1.4,1.0,"There was, yeah, it was amazing."
36196,PS2,6,452.64,453.84,1.2,1.0,We had like the vocabulary.
36196,PS2,6,453.84,456.48,2.64,1.0,I don't have the vocabulary for this during off.
36196,PS2,6,456.48,465.88,9.4,2.0,Peak hours this this will lower carbon emission.
36196,PS2,6,467.6,467.72,0.12,2.0,It's.
36196,PS2,6,471.56,475.04,3.48,3.0,Like uncontrolled costs by using infrastructure that's already there.
36196,PS2,6,475.4,480.92,5.52,2.0,And tackles cost by.
36196,PS2,6,482.48,486.2,3.72,3.0,"Yeah, using infrastructure that's already there."
36196,PS2,6,486.48,489.56,3.08,2.0,"That has already been influenced, yeah."
36196,PS2,6,497.2,498.12,0.92,2.0,Anything else?
36196,PS2,6,499.32,502.32,3.0,2.0,And I guess with delivery schedules because trains are more.
36196,PS2,6,502.6,505.24,2.64,2.0,"Oh well, the trains in China are pretty on time."
36196,PS2,6,505.24,510.2,4.96,1.0,Rate compared to I don't want to.
36196,PS2,6,511.36,511.56,0.2,2.0,Name it.
36196,PS2,6,511.64,526.48,14.84,2.0,"Additionally, additionally, delivery schedules would be more or less consistent."
36196,PS2,6,527.04,530.64,3.6,2.0,"Oh yeah, that would be would be reliable as."
36196,PS2,6,532.0,533.28,1.28,1.0,Train Times No.
36196,PS2,6,533.56,544.6,11.04,2.0,"As train times are, I want to say more or less fixed, but there has to be a better way to put it or."
36196,PS2,6,549.2,551.76,2.56,6.0,Is there a parade at night where there is less traffic?
36196,PS2,6,552.2,552.52,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
36196,PS2,6,552.52,566.28,13.76,2.0,"So during off peak hours, OK, I could say like for example at late at night would be reliable as train times are."
36196,PS2,6,567.16,571.04,3.88,4.0,We'll say the train timetable is more easy to control.
36196,PS2,6,571.24,571.76,0.52,2.0,OK.
36196,PS2,6,571.96,581.12,9.16,2.0,Train time are more easily controlled with that.
36196,PS2,6,582.16,582.84,0.68,1.0,Everyone's OK.
36196,PS2,6,583.52,584.04,0.52,1.0,OK.
36196,PS2,6,584.08,585.08,1.0,1.0,Next question?
35456,PS6,3,0.28,0.68,0.4,1.0,False.
35456,PS6,3,2.32,6.68,4.36,1.0,OK imagine new research study discovers us singing the shower for 20 minutes and more is good for health.
35456,PS6,3,6.72,9.2,2.48,1.0,Please go with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
35456,PS6,3,10.36,10.48,0.12,2.0,OK.
35456,PS6,3,11.92,21.44,9.52,3.0,"Well, the first thing is it's what's not a good idea about singing in the shower for 20 minutes is probably 1, you get cold, and 2:00, there's a lot of water wastage, I would think."
35456,PS6,3,23.2,23.52,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35456,PS6,3,23.52,25.04,1.52,3.0,How do we counter that?
35456,PS6,3,26.2,30.08,3.88,2.0,And it's like resting the natural resource like water to.
35456,PS6,3,32.12,40.8,8.68,1.0,It can be a water recycle loop or when you don't use soap or anything you can just reuse the water continuously and the more you use soap or anything that can thinking.
35456,PS6,3,42.96,43.36,0.4,2.0,That should.
35456,PS6,3,43.76,44.0,0.24,1.0,Over.
35456,PS6,3,45.6,52.08,6.48,3.0,"Because I'm also just thinking like, if you spend 20 minutes in the pool, like, your skin starts to get quite wrinkly."
35456,PS6,3,54.36,54.72,0.36,3.0,"Yeah, but."
35456,PS6,3,54.92,55.96,1.04,1.0,It's good for your health now.
35456,PS6,3,57.72,66.12,8.4,3.0,So how do you promote that a new research study discovers singing in the shower 420 singing for 20 minutes or.
35456,PS6,3,66.52,67.84,1.32,2.0,Sing in the shower for 20.
35456,PS6,3,67.88,68.12,0.24,3.0,Minutes.
35456,PS6,3,68.12,68.44,0.32,3.0,See.
35456,PS6,3,68.52,71.76,3.24,3.0,"So for example, is the shower 20 minutes itself or is the shower?"
35456,PS6,3,71.76,72.56,0.8,1.0,"No, the singing."
35456,PS6,3,72.56,74.84,2.28,3.0,30 minutes and the singing is 20 minutes.
35456,PS6,3,75.24,78.72,3.48,1.0,"That could be fine I think, as when the singing is over 20 minutes it's fine."
35456,PS6,3,78.72,79.24,0.52,1.0,Doesn't matter.
35456,PS6,3,80.08,81.48,1.4,3.0,Singing for 20 minutes could.
35456,PS6,3,83.4,83.48,0.08,1.0,Be.
35456,PS6,3,84.84,87.28,2.44,3.0,"Well, I think people like to sing to music sometimes."
35456,PS6,3,87.8,88.6,0.8,3.0,"Like, sing along."
35456,PS6,3,89.28,92.96,3.68,1.0,Put a integrate a sound system in the.
35456,PS6,3,93.2,95.08,1.88,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35456,PS6,3,95.92,96.4,0.48,1.0,Could do.
35456,PS6,3,97.28,99.84,2.56,3.0,I think people would just naturally vibe to that easily.
35456,PS6,3,99.84,101.0,1.16,3.0,Like it doesn't require.
35456,PS6,3,101.0,102.92,1.92,1.0,"Oh, it naturally turns on when you take a shower."
35456,PS6,3,103.2,103.64,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
35456,PS6,3,104.28,105.72,1.44,1.0,And it changes depending on the temperature.
35456,PS6,3,107.48,111.0,3.52,2.0,And I'll be singing is like stress reliever.
35456,PS6,3,111.48,115.08,3.6,2.0,So I just promote people to have more like mental.
35456,PS6,3,115.36,119.16,3.8,3.0,"Oh absolutely, a shower, a hot shower after a long day is also a stress reliever."
35456,PS6,3,119.16,123.24,4.08,3.0,So I think it's we're going to probably target relaxation as a.
35456,PS6,3,123.68,126.52,2.84,2.0,"Yeah, like promote hygiene."
35456,PS6,3,127.08,127.32,0.24,1.0,Oh yeah.
35456,PS6,3,127.32,127.76,0.44,2.0,Like people?
35456,PS6,3,127.76,128.28,0.52,3.0,Like take.
35456,PS6,3,128.6,132.0,3.4,2.0,A shower longer and then promote like mental health.
35456,PS6,3,133.0,134.96,1.96,3.0,"So hygiene, mental health, yeah."
35456,PS6,3,135.6,137.32,1.72,1.0,How do you make it more calming then?
35456,PS6,3,138.08,138.76,0.68,1.0,Not necessarily.
35456,PS6,3,138.76,140.68,1.92,1.0,They could be just singing just because they're vibing.
35456,PS6,3,140.96,143.56,2.6,1.0,They don't need to be necessarily for common reason.
35456,PS6,3,144.44,149.4,4.96,1.0,"Fresh for me, so recycling."
35456,PS6,3,149.4,153.44,4.04,3.0,Custom with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
35456,PS6,3,156.72,159.92,3.2,1.0,"You know, like when in arcades when you have the arrows for dancing."
35456,PS6,3,160.76,161.76,1.0,1.0,Put this in the shower.
35456,PS6,3,164.12,164.8,0.68,1.0,Look at it for me.
35456,PS6,3,165.08,166.0,0.92,1.0,"OK, that could work."
35456,PS6,3,166.0,166.72,0.72,1.0,That would work on it.
35456,PS6,3,166.72,166.76,0.04,1.0,I.
35456,PS6,3,166.76,168.12,1.36,3.0,See so many accidents.
35456,PS6,3,169.2,171.04,1.84,1.0,"So very, very rugged."
35456,PS6,3,171.12,172.6,1.48,1.0,So you Can't Sing too easily.
35456,PS6,3,175.08,176.4,1.32,1.0,"But yeah, very accidental proof."
35456,PS6,3,176.84,178.28,1.44,1.0,"That's to be fair, that's not for that thing."
35456,PS6,3,178.28,179.44,1.16,1.0,You'll end up singing that much.
35456,PS6,3,180.84,184.6,3.76,2.0,Like singing in the shower 20 minutes a day.
35456,PS6,3,185.4,186.72,1.32,2.0,Keep doctors away.
35456,PS6,3,187.56,188.32,0.76,1.0,Have a slogan.
35456,PS6,3,189.44,191.0,1.56,1.0,Do publicity stand for slogan?
35456,PS6,3,193.36,195.32,1.96,2.0,Just come up with the one Creative Radio.
35456,PS6,3,195.6,199.36,3.76,3.0,"But The thing is, like people do appreciate the acoustics in the bathroom, isn't it?"
35456,PS6,3,199.44,202.44,3.0,3.0,Like you just sound better in there automatically.
35456,PS6,3,202.72,203.32,0.6,2.0,Oh wow.
35456,PS6,3,204.6,207.88,3.28,3.0,And I wonder if we could leverage that.
35456,PS6,3,209.04,210.32,1.28,3.0,Discover your hidden.
35456,PS6,3,210.84,211.72,0.88,1.0,"Oh, that's a good point."
35456,PS6,3,212.44,215.36,2.92,3.0,Like the acoustics in the bathroom are usually better.
35456,PS6,3,216.96,223.32,6.36,1.0,I'm not sure how to leverage it since since it's already there because the phone means you don't need a mic.
35456,PS6,3,224.0,226.76,2.76,2.0,Like you can cover your hidden potential.
35456,PS6,3,226.92,240.96,14.04,3.0,"Yeah, I mean, it could also be like confidence boosting as well, right when you discover you're sounding good."
35456,PS6,3,241.28,241.92,0.64,1.0,Come up with.
35456,PS6,3,245.0,246.36,1.36,3.0,One creative idea.
35456,PS6,3,250.92,253.04,2.12,1.0,A magic shower that automatically turns on these.
35456,PS6,3,257.72,258.96,1.24,3.0,"I mean, it doesn't have to be magic."
35456,PS6,3,258.96,263.32,4.36,3.0,"It could be easily that, you know, you've got pressure sensors on the ground."
35456,PS6,3,263.72,273.92,10.2,3.0,"So as soon as you step on the into the shower booth, that could be connected to a switch which turns on the the speakers or music."
35456,PS6,3,275.84,285.48,9.64,3.0,And it should be like customisable so that you could play whatever songs you want to play and or you could have like a bathroom playlist kind of thing.
35456,PS6,3,290.08,290.2,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35456,PS6,3,290.32,294.08,3.76,3.0,So I think we could discuss for like 2 more minutes before we have to start writing something.
35456,PS6,3,294.56,299.08,4.52,1.0,"Music display, water recycling."
35456,PS6,3,299.6,300.92,1.32,1.0,That could be our shower system.
35456,PS6,3,301.16,304.56,3.4,3.0,So that I think could also be integrated in the pressure sensors.
35456,PS6,3,306.08,306.4,0.32,1.0,That's hard.
35456,PS6,3,307.28,308.04,0.76,3.0,Pressure sensor.
35456,PS6,3,308.04,312.68,4.64,3.0,So you've got to step on to the shower.
35456,PS6,3,312.68,314.0,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, into the shower cubicle."
35456,PS6,3,314.0,316.24,2.24,3.0,"So when you step on it, it's a pressure."
35456,PS6,3,316.68,323.0,6.32,3.0,"OK, so that will turn on both the sound system and the recycling loop."
35456,PS6,3,323.44,325.6,2.16,2.0,"OK, and the music turn on."
35456,PS6,3,325.72,334.36,8.64,3.0,"Yeah, music turns on water is not wasted, but I think once you've got that sensor, you could pretty much switch on any electronic response, right?"
35456,PS6,3,334.44,341.4,6.96,3.0,"Like music, recycling, anything else, we want to like, encourage the experience."
35456,PS6,3,341.56,342.76,1.2,1.0,Makes you want to sing.
35456,PS6,3,344.04,346.24,2.2,2.0,And make you want to stay that long.
35456,PS6,3,346.88,347.88,1.0,3.0,"In charge, yeah."
35456,PS6,3,348.36,348.48,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35456,PS6,3,350.92,353.4,2.48,3.0,Lock the door for 20 minutes.
35456,PS6,3,355.12,357.44,2.32,3.0,It's like a yeah.
35456,PS6,3,358.56,361.08,2.52,1.0,If they get out of the shower and die automatically.
35456,PS6,3,363.0,364.48,1.48,3.0,There's also like these little progress.
35456,PS6,3,364.48,365.96,1.48,3.0,"OK, we've got to start writing something."
35456,PS6,3,366.68,376.04,9.36,3.0,"There's like, you know how in games, video games, you've got this progress bar and the more like, for example, Pokémon, you could power up the Pokémon by giving it potion."
35456,PS6,3,376.04,377.68,1.64,3.0,So you've got like this progress bar.
35456,PS6,3,377.68,378.2,0.52,1.0,Of how long?
35456,PS6,3,378.2,380.84,2.64,1.0,"Yeah, freezing into the water if you stay long enough."
35456,PS6,3,381.12,382.48,1.36,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35456,PS6,3,382.64,383.52,0.88,1.0,"OK, what should we write?"
35456,PS6,3,383.6,384.68,1.08,1.0,"OK, what should we write then?"
35456,PS6,3,388.24,391.4,3.16,2.0,"Oh, like maybe Gallon subsidized the water cars?"
35456,PS6,3,391.4,391.56,0.16,2.0,What?
35456,PS6,3,392.8,394.68,1.88,1.0,"Should be going on subsidized, assuming."
35456,PS6,3,398.24,401.16,2.92,3.0,They barely do much for the tobacco industry.
35456,PS6,3,402.92,404.4,1.48,3.0,"Just smoking is bad, OK?"
35456,PS6,3,407.48,408.56,1.08,1.0,So any pressure sensor them?
35456,PS6,3,409.56,410.16,0.6,3.0,I think so.
35456,PS6,3,410.16,419.32,9.16,3.0,"I think that's that's a good idea for one, because then you could just trigger different responses like sound recycling, lock the door."
35456,PS6,3,419.52,420.84,1.32,3.0,I think that might I mean.
35456,PS6,3,422.36,423.12,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, we can write it."

35315,PS1,6,219.64,222.28,2.64,6.0,And then there could be like a gala at the end.
35315,PS1,6,222.28,231.2,8.92,6.0,"And that could like raise funds to pay for the artists to like, I don't know, do their work and pay for the materials and what not."
35315,PS1,6,232.28,236.76,4.48,6.0,Like a Met Gala for plastic like fashion.

35315,PS1,6,260.56,265.68,5.12,4.0,They could also like decrease the use of like plastic plastic bottle.
35315,PS1,6,265.68,266.56,0.88,4.0,I think that is good.
35315,PS1,6,267.16,268.24,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, some kind of."

35315,PS1,6,284.64,285.04,0.4,3.0,More.
35315,PS1,6,285.48,286.2,0.72,6.0,"Benefits, yeah."

35315,PS1,6,290.16,290.48,0.32,1.0,Of the.
35315,PS1,6,291.2,291.56,0.36,4.0,Things.
35315,PS1,6,292.68,295.48,2.8,6.0,"Yeah, I think a lot of these solutions are actually more profitable."
35315,PS1,6,296.96,298.08,1.12,6.0,So it's like a good I.
35315,PS1,6,298.68,299.68,1.0,1.0,Think it's all about it.
35315,PS1,6,299.68,306.04,6.36,1.0,So I'm just trying to combine them into one single solution or choose one of them.
35315,PS1,6,306.64,308.88,2.24,6.0,"I think a few of these are compatible, I mean."
35315,PS1,6,309.96,312.4,2.44,1.0,Discourage disposable.
35315,PS1,6,312.44,314.32,1.88,1.0,I don't really discourage the use of.

35315,PS1,6,333.84,341.16,7.32,6.0,"So I think like framing some of these solutions as like a big event like think like Coachella for like plastics removal, right?"
35315,PS1,6,341.16,349.64,8.48,6.0,"And so like maybe they, they can like display different products that are alternatives to plastics, such as like the algae based ones we talked about."
35315,PS1,6,349.64,369.12,19.48,6.0,"And they can have workshops or events where you're like competing to like recycle materials for art, fashion, maybe even like functional like like if you can press them, like you were saying, you can maybe use them for building material."
35315,PS1,6,370.12,378.12,8.0,6.0,"So maybe if you like frame this as an overarching festival or event, then you can compile a lot of these ideas into it."
35315,PS1,6,385.96,386.44,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
35315,PS1,6,387.48,389.96,2.48,2.0,Any other ways to compress?

35315,PS1,6,390.64,394.88,4.24,5.0,It I think to to add on that on top of that we can put some campaign on.
35315,PS1,6,396.08,396.8,0.72,2.0,"Yeah, some."
35315,PS1,6,397.0,398.72,1.72,5.0,Some campaign on social media.

35315,PS1,6,409.68,426.64,16.96,6.0,"And I think since we also talked about how this can be like a money saver, maybe there would be corporate sponsors who'd be willing to help fund some of this like if they can, I don't know, say like benefit from the the ideas that come out of it."
35315,PS1,6,427.24,435.92,8.68,4.0,"Yeah, another part of like government can also do something for example like give the funding for example, there is a sustainability centers in the country."
35315,PS1,6,435.92,443.4,7.48,4.0,So they already like just want to do to improve some technical like how to do the recycles things.
35315,PS1,6,443.4,445.24,1.84,4.0,"And yeah, I think they would help."
35315,PS1,6,447.2,448.2,1.0,1.0,This is pretty much this.

36490,PS2,6,51.6,60.44,8.84,3.0,"I think, you know, maybe not feasible, but if we're going creative, imagine you had a very advanced 3D printer."
36490,PS2,6,60.84,66.56,5.72,3.0,"Whenever you can't get delivery of a particular tool, you just print it yourself."
36490,PS2,6,70.36,72.84,2.48,4.0,I think that's a really cool and creative idea.
36490,PS2,6,73.16,77.72,4.56,4.0,"I guess my only if I have a critique of it and I think it's cool, maybe we can get around with it."
36490,PS2,6,77.72,95.04,17.32,4.0,"It's just that I feel like this these these creative ideas also have to have have to be sort of bound within some kind of realistic possibility because it's like, let's say you need a specific specific specific type of metal or an alloy or something."
36490,PS2,6,95.28,98.92,3.64,4.0,"If this device can just magically print it, it's almost like a magical machine."
36490,PS2,6,99.28,100.92,1.64,4.0,"But, and it's a great idea though."
36490,PS2,6,100.92,102.28,1.36,4.0,But it's you know what I mean.
36490,PS2,6,102.72,103.92,1.2,4.0,But we could maybe run with it.
36490,PS2,6,103.92,105.52,1.6,4.0,But that was just my one I guess.
36490,PS2,6,105.6,108.36,2.76,3.0,"You're right, you need the initial material."
36490,PS2,6,108.36,110.16,1.8,3.0,You can't print something out of there.
36490,PS2,6,115.32,116.92,1.6,4.0,But I do like that idea.
36490,PS2,6,120.56,131.76,11.2,4.0,"Yeah, I got to be honest, I don't have any any great creative thoughts on on this one."
36490,PS2,6,132.2,132.8,0.6,4.0,I didn't have one.
36490,PS2,6,134.36,135.0,0.64,4.0,It's a hard one.
36490,PS2,6,136.08,139.32,3.24,4.0,"I know nothing about like logistics and supply chains, the supply."
36490,PS2,6,139.76,142.96,3.2,2.0,Chain is from the manufacturing to the consumers.
36490,PS2,6,143.56,157.92,14.36,2.0,The supply chain isn't actually working either the part of the middleman like the warehouse storage is not properly functioning or it can't be from the company level.
36490,PS2,6,157.92,162.96,5.04,2.0,So I think you should we should be looking at the middleman logistic cycle now.
36490,PS2,6,163.24,181.2,17.96,2.0,"OK, So what I I can think of is if you can be able to create an online app, you know, that can enable people to see and book our services."
36490,PS2,6,181.88,196.88,15.0,2.0,"OK in time or sometimes the mechanism of going to get information from the company or company sending a member of a member of the staff to go to, you know the primary consumers to inquire."
36490,PS2,6,196.88,198.68,1.8,2.0,I'm going back to get the idea.
36490,PS2,6,198.96,201.96,3.0,2.0,Can actually delay and can also lead to damage.
36490,PS2,6,202.08,203.2,1.12,2.0,So if we can.
36490,PS2,6,203.2,203.52,0.32,5.0,Develop.
36490,PS2,6,203.68,205.04,1.36,5.0,I think that's already underlying.
36490,PS2,6,205.2,205.92,0.72,5.0,That's already happening.
36490,PS2,6,206.2,207.0,0.8,6.0,Creativity.
36490,PS2,6,207.8,208.12,0.32,2.0,That's the app.
36490,PS2,6,208.56,209.0,0.44,5.0,That's already.
36490,PS2,6,209.0,210.32,1.32,6.0,Happening already.
36490,PS2,6,210.32,210.76,0.44,5.0,Have something?
36490,PS2,6,210.92,216.24,5.32,4.0,"Like that, almost like an Uber for supply chain delivery services, something like that."
36490,PS2,6,216.64,223.48,6.84,2.0,"Yes, but you can develop an electric and an electric kind of cargo."
36490,PS2,6,224.36,234.04,9.68,2.0,"You know that just goes off when you log into the app, book your products, the machine development directly to your company or your warehouse or to your house."
36490,PS2,6,234.2,237.96,3.76,6.0,Create like a teleporter where you can teleport.
36490,PS2,6,240.32,240.52,0.2,3.0,Items.
36490,PS2,6,240.52,241.48,0.96,3.0,I like teleporter.
36490,PS2,6,244.16,244.92,0.76,4.0,Teleportation.
36490,PS2,6,246.0,251.24,5.24,6.0,"People have shops in their house where once they click there, there's a path like a magnetic."
36490,PS2,6,251.68,252.32,0.64,1.0,Path a wave.
36490,PS2,6,253.28,255.48,2.2,1.0,"Yeah, companies Magic wand."
36490,PS2,6,256.32,262.6,6.28,6.0,"No, you know, magic wand like, you know how calling like mobile network is built out of thing."
36490,PS2,6,262.76,268.48,5.72,6.0,"Who could have imagined 50 years ago, 100 years ago that somebody could be here and call somebody back in Africa."
36490,PS2,6,268.76,275.52,6.76,6.0,"You know, nobody could have imagined that I could stay here and be talking to someone down there, seeing them so we could create something."
36490,PS2,6,276.64,276.72,0.08,5.0,You.
36490,PS2,6,276.96,277.04,0.08,6.0,Know.
36490,PS2,6,279.32,279.68,0.36,4.0,Yeah.
36490,PS2,6,280.04,280.96,0.92,3.0,Just not be nice.
36490,PS2,6,281.12,285.84,4.72,3.0,"Instead of just downloading like files, you download things."
36490,PS2,6,288.52,294.36,5.84,6.0,"That's now the phone is the portal for making calls, for making video calls and all."
36490,PS2,6,294.48,300.44,5.96,6.0,"So when you just press the shorts like whatever you are like, you just need to connect to the supplier."
36490,PS2,6,300.44,303.4,2.96,3.0,And then this gives you instantly and.
36490,PS2,6,304.2,306.48,2.28,5.0,"When it's moving into it, we'll be hitting this."
36490,PS2,6,308.32,308.92,0.6,1.0,Is not real.
36490,PS2,6,309.16,311.28,2.12,4.0,"Just one word, Just one word, Just tell us."
36490,PS2,6,311.28,311.44,0.16,1.0,What?
36490,PS2,6,311.44,311.72,0.28,4.0,I didn't.
36490,PS2,6,312.92,315.16,2.24,1.0,Tell me no real.
36490,PS2,6,315.16,315.48,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, I think."
36490,PS2,6,317.96,318.52,0.56,4.0,That's very crazy.
36490,PS2,6,318.84,321.88,3.04,3.0,"I mean, just when you said anything about being realistic then."
36490,PS2,6,322.92,328.48,5.56,1.0,What if we are maybe a car or something bigger?
36490,PS2,6,329.64,332.28,2.64,1.0,How do we make it pass through?
36490,PS2,6,332.56,337.04,4.48,6.0,Did you for once conceived the idea that the fact 20 years ago?
36490,PS2,6,337.12,337.8,0.68,6.0,Did you know God?
36490,PS2,6,339.12,339.6,0.48,1.0,Is God?
36490,PS2,6,339.6,340.36,0.76,1.0,Is God this word?
36490,PS2,6,340.36,340.56,0.2,1.0,Words?
36490,PS2,6,340.56,341.96,1.4,5.0,Cannot be felt.
36490,PS2,6,342.32,342.52,0.2,5.0,This is.
36490,PS2,6,342.76,344.04,1.28,1.0,"Physical, I think."
36490,PS2,6,345.16,346.36,1.2,2.0,This is delivering item.
36490,PS2,6,346.52,356.32,9.8,2.0,"I'm still insisting that if you can be able to to design a kind of a shuttle, but now this shuttle is not going to use Rd."
36490,PS2,6,357.24,357.52,0.28,2.0,right?
36490,PS2,6,357.56,368.12,10.56,2.0,"A kind of small cargo shuttle that you can use robot to program deliver this item here, just like a small drone deliver this item here."
36490,PS2,6,368.4,378.36,9.96,2.0,"It's not going to use Rd., it's going to use AIR and it's going to be controlled by AI, not an individual, so that there will be increased efficiency and."
36490,PS2,6,378.52,379.44,0.92,6.0,You have an idea?
36490,PS2,6,379.56,381.16,1.6,6.0,"OK, I'm still going to reputation."
36490,PS2,6,381.24,396.96,15.72,6.0,"Now we have not the reputation but but like houses are constructed in such a way that they have linkages and then in that linkages they are like a part of, you know how there's train station, you know, under the houses you get."
36490,PS2,6,397.2,403.68,6.48,6.0,"So now company when you buy something from the company, they have different channels connecting to different manufacturers."
36490,PS2,6,403.88,414.48,10.6,6.0,"When you buy it, they just put it there, put in your location address, it comes and drops it at that point in your house where the shuttles are, as in the rails are connected, I don't know."
36490,PS2,6,414.76,415.16,0.4,6.0,Do you get?
36490,PS2,6,418.04,419.24,1.2,1.0,We should use robots.
36490,PS2,6,419.24,419.4,0.16,1.0,"OK, I."
36490,PS2,6,419.68,420.04,0.36,4.0,Think I'll.
36490,PS2,6,420.04,421.16,1.12,5.0,Go with this.
36490,PS2,6,421.36,422.16,0.8,1.0,"One Yeah, robots."
36490,PS2,6,422.52,422.92,0.4,4.0,OK.
36490,PS2,6,423.4,424.2,0.8,1.0,He's of robots.
36490,PS2,6,425.16,426.2,1.04,4.0,Robots alright.
36490,PS2,6,426.72,427.96,1.24,1.0,But you did this clear petition.
36490,PS2,6,427.96,431.88,3.92,1.0,"Just with such points, probably you have to break people."
36490,PS2,6,431.92,432.36,0.44,2.0,'S houses.
36490,PS2,6,432.36,432.48,0.12,1.0,And.
36490,PS2,6,433.48,434.44,0.96,5.0,Then we said.
36490,PS2,6,435.04,435.84,0.8,1.0,Delivery robots.
36490,PS2,6,436.16,446.04,9.88,4.0,"Delivery robots I had, I had one thought on your original idea, which was like an app and I was thinking, because what happens often with it talks about vulnerabilities for supply chains."
36490,PS2,6,446.04,452.44,6.4,4.0,"So maybe this particular truck driver is not able to for whatever reasons, not able to collect the goods."
36490,PS2,6,452.44,458.2,5.76,4.0,These this with some middleman were focusing on if there was like an Uber for like supply chains.
36490,PS2,6,458.44,476.48,18.04,4.0,"If a company suddenly realizes that the, the, the delivery service that we're depending on is no longer able to pick up the goods, there's a way to send a signal and every other person who has like a big truck or works in the delivery space and go, OK, what they're going to pay me, I'll take that gig, I'll go pick it up and I'll do it instead."
36490,PS2,6,476.64,484.32,7.68,4.0,"So it's a way of maybe simplifying the process of finding alternative, but that's my only idea."
36490,PS2,6,484.32,494.68,10.36,4.0,"I've had enough, the right one, but that's just so we've got teleportation, delivery robots, a machine that prints stuff, anything you want."
36490,PS2,6,495.32,499.68,4.36,4.0,"Sorry, that's a simplification and and like Uber for supply chain."
36490,PS2,6,499.68,501.76,2.08,1.0,Was that what he said?
36490,PS2,6,501.76,502.6,0.84,1.0,The machine that.
36490,PS2,6,506.12,506.68,0.56,3.0,Prints anything.
36490,PS2,6,507.44,509.84,2.4,4.0,"I'll just say magic, no magic."
36490,PS2,6,511.16,511.4,0.24,5.0,Please.
36490,PS2,6,514.44,515.6,1.16,4.0,"OK, what are we?"
36490,PS2,6,515.6,516.28,0.68,4.0,What are we going for?
36490,PS2,6,516.28,516.32,0.04,4.0,I.
36490,PS2,6,520.56,520.8,0.24,2.0,Think the.
36490,PS2,6,520.96,521.12,0.16,1.0,Uber.
36490,PS2,6,521.16,521.32,0.16,1.0,Uber.
36490,PS2,6,522.36,524.12,1.76,4.0,"But it's realistic though, that's the thing."
36490,PS2,6,524.12,524.2,0.08,4.0,We.
36490,PS2,6,525.52,527.04,1.52,2.0,"Are not great, we just we are just interested."
36490,PS2,6,527.6,529.56,1.96,6.0,"Outside the force, not what is realistic."
36490,PS2,6,529.56,530.16,0.6,2.0,Anything is.
36490,PS2,6,531.28,538.68,7.4,4.0,"But should it creative if creativity be to be meaningful, it has to work between some confines of reality, you know, Otherwise you just got magic, magical thinking and."
36490,PS2,6,538.84,541.08,2.24,1.0,Then it's still not coming to realization.
36490,PS2,6,543.44,544.8,1.36,1.0,That's how we do feasibility stories.
36490,PS2,6,545.8,548.76,2.96,4.0,"OK, and I need to do some quick typing so just tell me what I'm going for."
36490,PS2,6,548.76,549.96,1.2,4.0,I think we can.
36490,PS2,6,551.52,567.24,15.72,2.0,Book A an AI cargo model that you have to go through here and people will have to book through house and their items will be delivered to their.
36490,PS2,6,567.88,569.64,1.76,6.0,"House using chips, yes, Yeah."
36490,PS2,6,570.84,581.36,10.52,3.0,"Yeah, it would be great in having better algorithms that supply chain predictions, so we optimize how much you need to buy and reduce the risk of shortage."
36490,PS2,6,582.0,582.96,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, it would be great."
36490,PS2,6,585.12,587.48,2.36,4.0,"OK, So what am I writing?"
36490,PS2,6,588.96,591.04,2.08,4.0,"OK, AI."
36490,PS2,6,592.08,592.6,0.52,1.0,Do see that?
36490,PS2,6,593.24,595.96,2.72,2.0,Sensor AIA truck.
36490,PS2,6,597.72,597.84,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36490,PS2,6,603.72,618.16,14.44,4.0,Services a cargo services people and companies can use an app.
36490,PS2,6,618.6,619.48,0.88,4.0,I don't know that.
36490,PS2,6,621.52,623.0,1.48,1.0,If I go all that there.
36490,PS2,6,623.72,629.56,5.84,4.0,Where they record.
36490,PS2,6,634.28,639.24,4.96,1.0,"You know, let's say in the app, the app is owned by the AI cargo services."
36490,PS2,6,639.68,644.24,4.56,1.0,"So if you want to make an order, you open the app, you make your order, you make the."
36490,PS2,6,644.32,645.32,1.0,2.0,App to your location.
36490,PS2,6,645.4,652.64,7.24,1.0,It's your location so the the AI so whatever will go to please pick it up and get into the.
36490,PS2,6,652.76,657.6,4.84,2.0,Person amazing.
36490,PS2,6,658.64,669.6,10.96,1.0,Teleportation I'm printing of whatever the does budget just the mouse and the print test.
36490,PS2,6,672.92,676.16,3.24,4.0,"But you know the one this, this that we'll go with this, this is good."
36490,PS2,6,676.16,688.4,12.24,4.0,"The one thing I must say is like, you know, if an if an object's pretty big that the drone you need is going to be like practically a helicopter, It's it's not just like like try transporting a fridge."
36490,PS2,6,690.12,691.04,0.92,4.0,"OK, next."
36490,PS2,6,691.24,691.72,0.48,4.0,So good.
35852,PS1,3,2.12,6.88,4.76,1.0,"Please, plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of her lifetime."
35852,PS1,3,8.28,11.24,2.96,1.0,Plastic waste reduce plastic pollution.

35852,PS1,3,32.24,38.04,5.8,2.0,X to reduce plastic.
35852,PS1,3,38.04,41.44,3.4,1.0,Lower than plastic.
35852,PS1,3,49.76,51.48,1.72,3.0,Encourage people to.
35852,PS1,3,51.8,52.56,0.76,1.0,Reuse.

35852,PS1,3,69.28,71.32,2.04,2.0,Creative creative idea.
35852,PS1,3,71.4,74.72,3.32,2.0,Creative Plastic.
35852,PS1,3,76.68,76.96,0.28,1.0,Like.
35852,PS1,3,80.28,88.04,7.76,2.0,"I think like how people deal with the nuclear waste, do the same to plastic products."
35852,PS1,3,88.48,94.04,5.56,2.0,"We can also send it to space not in Earth, like using SpaceX."
35852,PS1,3,103.41,123.25,19.84,2.0,"Yeah, this is an easy question, but we have to be creative, right?"
35852,PS1,3,124.12,129.16,5.04,2.0,And so many things people have already done to deal with the plastic problem.
35852,PS1,3,240.56,240.8,0.24,1.0,Maybe.
35852,PS1,3,240.8,241.28,0.48,3.0,Next.
35852,PS1,3,242.28,246.72,4.44,2.0,We can I have other ideas?
35852,PS1,3,247.6,248.12,0.52,2.0,I don't know.
35852,PS1,3,248.12,248.48,0.36,2.0,I don't know.
35852,PS1,3,248.56,249.28,0.72,2.0,Do you have any?
35852,PS1,3,254.56,261.0,6.44,3.0,"To improve person, science and technology."
35852,PS1,3,262.0,262.12,0.12,1.0,To.
35852,PS1,3,263.16,267.0,3.84,3.0,Make make more plastic reusable.
35852,PS1,3,269.56,277.96,8.4,2.0,"There's only one way to find a replacement, but we don't know anything but how to replace it, or recycle or replace."
35852,PS1,3,278.96,280.0,1.04,2.0,It's not creative.
35852,PS1,3,290.24,301.04,10.8,2.0,"Like what I can think about is that people use to replace the bags, plastic bags into some wood bags, some other bags."
35852,PS1,3,301.72,308.92,7.2,2.0,And maybe I know that the water like the bottle of water always use plastics.
35852,PS1,3,308.92,311.68,2.76,2.0,Maybe we can do the same like use paper.
35852,PS1,3,312.68,313.84,1.16,1.0,I think this is the first.
35852,PS1,3,314.64,314.84,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35852,PS1,3,317.16,317.24,0.08,1.0,It.
35852,PS1,3,318.32,324.52,6.2,2.0,Can be be more specific like make the water the bottle of water.
35852,PS1,3,368.01,369.65,1.64,2.0,Like there are those milks.
35852,PS1,3,370.21,383.08,12.87,2.0,"Those milks are not kept in in plastics, but in a metal water."
35852,PS1,3,384.72,391.52,6.8,2.0,"You know, instead of put water into the."
34253,PS3,3,6.72,9.28,2.56,3.0,Imagine a new pandemic has emerged as transmitted.
34253,PS3,3,10.12,14.4,4.28,3.0,Sorry please people want to reduce its spread.
34253,PS3,3,15.36,16.28,0.92,1.0,Don't say sorry.
34253,PS3,3,22.72,25.4,2.68,1.0,I think this should be implemented from the top right.
34253,PS3,3,26.04,34.04,8.0,1.0,"If there's like a spreading with the word, sorry, we have to abandon, we have to ban this word from the top like."
34253,PS3,3,34.84,36.4,1.56,2.0,I think that's the most intuitive answer.
34253,PS3,3,36.56,41.04,4.48,3.0,"No, but that doesn't that doesn't work because if you ban it, how do you regulate it?"
34253,PS3,3,41.04,44.4,3.36,3.0,There is no like there's no language police.
34253,PS3,3,45.36,47.84,2.48,3.0,So so basically you have how do you police it?
34253,PS3,3,47.84,49.0,1.16,3.0,How do you reinforce it?
34253,PS3,3,49.0,50.84,1.84,3.0,Is the is the is the crucial.
34253,PS3,3,50.84,53.56,2.72,3.0,Don't think about who's who's making the regulations.
34253,PS3,3,53.56,57.52,3.96,3.0,"That's the easy answer, but the hard answer is right."
34253,PS3,3,57.52,58.64,1.12,3.0,How do we know that?
34253,PS3,3,58.96,65.08,6.12,3.0,"You know, we're, we're not saying sorry or we are saying sorry so obviously."
34253,PS3,3,65.16,68.84,3.68,1.0,With the IEI you can detect whether you're saying sorry or not right?
34253,PS3,3,69.2,74.72,5.52,1.0,Because at AI they can actually catch what you are saying.
34253,PS3,3,76.28,76.84,0.56,3.0,And.
34253,PS3,3,77.0,78.76,1.76,1.0,Technologically like this.
34253,PS3,3,79.12,80.16,1.04,2.0,Is when it's too late.
34253,PS3,3,80.68,82.56,1.88,3.0,But not everyone has a smartphone.
34253,PS3,3,84.16,85.52,1.36,3.0,"First of all, not everyone has a smartphone."
34253,PS3,3,85.52,95.48,9.96,3.0,"I know a lot of people in Germany does not have a smartphone, especially people that are a bit older, not even too old, like like people in their like 50s and 60s does not have a smartphone."
34253,PS3,3,95.8,97.24,1.44,3.0,So there is no there.
34253,PS3,3,97.32,100.08,2.76,3.0,"They don't know about AI, they don't know about social media."
34253,PS3,3,100.68,101.92,1.24,3.0,There's a lot of people like that.
34253,PS3,3,101.92,109.64,7.72,3.0,"So honestly, it has to stem from something a bit more like in a."
34253,PS3,3,109.64,110.36,0.72,2.0,Television.
34253,PS3,3,111.48,112.72,1.24,2.0,National security?
34253,PS3,3,112.76,114.56,1.8,2.0,"A lot, no."
34253,PS3,3,115.2,116.72,1.52,3.0,But how do you police that?
34253,PS3,3,116.72,127.16,10.44,3.0,"The thing is, OK if I, if I notice Philip said sorry today, through TV, through whatever, through the surveillance and then how do we prevent it?"
34253,PS3,3,128.0,130.0,2.0,2.0,"Yeah, you sent them all to quarantine."
34253,PS3,3,131.6,132.0,0.4,1.0,And also.
34253,PS3,3,132.24,139.64,7.4,3.0,"But everyone else can say, sorry, it's it's like you said, I send you to quarantine and it does not help because you're not you're."
34253,PS3,3,139.64,140.76,1.12,2.0,Looking the script then.
34253,PS3,3,142.96,143.28,0.32,3.0,Isn't it?
34253,PS3,3,143.4,144.2,0.8,3.0,It doesn't.
34253,PS3,3,144.52,145.96,1.44,3.0,How does it limit the spread?
34253,PS3,3,145.96,146.76,0.8,3.0,Because I can.
34253,PS3,3,146.8,147.68,0.88,3.0,I'm outside.
34253,PS3,3,147.72,148.88,1.16,3.0,I'm outside of the jail.
34253,PS3,3,148.88,149.24,0.36,3.0,Right.
34253,PS3,3,149.36,150.8,1.44,3.0,"I didn't say sorry, but I can."
34253,PS3,3,150.96,152.2,1.24,3.0,I can easily say it.
34253,PS3,3,152.76,152.92,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
34253,PS3,3,152.92,155.4,2.48,3.0,Then I think cut off everyone's tongue.
34253,PS3,3,157.36,161.64,4.28,1.0,"Yeah, it's doable, but The thing is, is this only the English story that?"
34253,PS3,3,162.08,163.48,1.4,3.0,"Oh yeah, this is English story."
34253,PS3,3,163.48,163.8,0.32,3.0,Is that that?
34253,PS3,3,164.72,164.84,0.12,1.0,Was.
34253,PS3,3,164.84,166.48,1.64,1.0,"Oh yeah, that's only happening in the English."
34253,PS3,3,166.48,169.36,2.88,3.0,"Right, so anyone who speaks English cut off their tongue."
34253,PS3,3,170.6,171.56,0.96,3.0,"No, because this is."
34253,PS3,3,172.24,174.36,2.12,2.0,This is a shocking.
34253,PS3,3,174.64,180.96,6.32,3.0,"Yeah, but that's that's something from the roots because you're you're like putting people in jail does not stop the spread."
34253,PS3,3,182.72,189.56,6.84,3.0,"This is this is you can't do quarantine because quarantine is airborne Pandemic, you can't do quarantine."
34253,PS3,3,189.64,190.76,1.12,3.0,This is not airborne.
34253,PS3,3,191.4,191.52,0.12,2.0,True.
34253,PS3,3,191.92,192.32,0.4,3.0,You're right.
34253,PS3,3,192.32,207.92,15.6,3.0,"And also we need to know like how, what proximity that, you know, if I say sorry, is it like, is everyone going to get like infected within like one mile, 2 mile, 10 miles or just like close proximity, you know, so we also need to know that."
34253,PS3,3,207.92,213.88,5.96,3.0,"But if we're just kind of like trying to solve this problem, reduce its spread."
34253,PS3,3,214.56,233.88,19.32,1.0,"Can we do like, you know, kind of create some medicine so that we put into the the water supplies or when the people drink it, they lose their voice and then meanwhile we come up with some, you know, IT anti pandemic tablet or something or you know."
34253,PS3,3,234.48,235.08,0.6,3.0,Losing.
34253,PS3,3,235.2,236.12,0.92,3.0,Losing someone's voice.
34253,PS3,3,236.44,236.92,0.48,1.0,"Voice, yeah."
34253,PS3,3,236.92,242.12,5.2,1.0,"So in two weeks or 10 or in a month, and within that time we can come up with some solution."
34253,PS3,3,242.4,245.88,3.48,3.0,That's actually a bit better than mine because it's more a tiny bit better.
34253,PS3,3,246.52,247.32,0.8,3.0,A tiny bit better.
34253,PS3,3,248.48,250.32,1.84,3.0,"But none of this is ethical, honestly."
34253,PS3,3,250.32,250.76,0.44,3.0,Like this is.
34253,PS3,3,251.0,251.76,0.76,2.0,Supposed to be creative.
34253,PS3,3,252.72,254.64,1.92,3.0,It does not say how ethical we need.
34253,PS3,3,259.32,259.6,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
34253,PS3,3,259.6,261.24,1.64,2.0,So which one do we on the side with?
34253,PS3,3,261.44,263.64,2.2,3.0,I think we can come up with something a bit more smarter.
34253,PS3,3,263.64,264.32,0.68,3.0,Let's think more.
34253,PS3,3,265.68,269.6,3.92,1.0,"Because if it's a pandemic, there's a way to control it, right?"
34253,PS3,3,269.8,271.56,1.76,1.0,There's a way to kind of let.
34253,PS3,3,273.48,273.96,0.48,3.0,Me think.
34253,PS3,3,283.36,284.8,1.44,2.0,"Can't you hit me twice, everyone?"
34253,PS3,3,285.56,286.96,1.4,3.0,I cannot why?
34253,PS3,3,286.96,287.6,0.64,3.0,What are you?
34253,PS3,3,287.88,288.72,0.84,3.0,Are you OK?
34253,PS3,3,288.72,293.72,5.0,3.0,"Like just coming up with, I mean, cutting with answers, that's like."
34253,PS3,3,294.04,295.64,1.6,2.0,Cutting everyone's tongue is also very.
34253,PS3,3,297.36,299.44,2.08,3.0,How do you hypnotize everyone?
34253,PS3,3,299.68,301.4,1.72,3.0,So who is the hypnotizer?
34253,PS3,3,301.64,304.12,2.48,3.0,How do you do you go to everyone's house and hypnotize?
34253,PS3,3,305.68,306.04,0.36,1.0,I think.
34253,PS3,3,306.04,307.44,1.4,2.0,Just for how?
34253,PS3,3,307.44,310.8,3.36,3.0,Long do they eat or drink within this moment?
34253,PS3,3,310.96,311.52,0.56,2.0,"We, we can."
34253,PS3,3,311.8,316.72,4.92,1.0,We can research on the vaccine within a period of time and doing that.
34253,PS3,3,316.72,320.48,3.76,1.0,Everyone just don't speak and how to reach that?
34253,PS3,3,320.56,323.24,2.68,3.0,Feel like that will be a bit better or we're just.
34253,PS3,3,324.2,329.04,4.84,1.0,"Yeah, and then we come up with the vaccine and when they get the vaccine, they can retain their voice."
34253,PS3,3,329.04,330.76,1.72,3.0,"OK, let's go back to like reality."
34253,PS3,3,330.76,337.6,6.84,3.0,"So on every media, we have to like obviously let everyone know that you cannot say sorry."
34253,PS3,3,337.92,352.08,14.16,3.0,"And there we need to let also we need to let people know what are the alternative words that you can say instead of sorry, like, excuse me or, you know, in a different language like intrude, go."
34253,PS3,3,352.32,354.64,2.32,3.0,"You know, you people need to learn intrude go."
34253,PS3,3,354.64,355.68,1.04,3.0,Everyone learns.
34253,PS3,3,355.76,357.0,1.24,3.0,That's like sorry in German.
34253,PS3,3,357.0,357.48,0.48,3.0,We are so get.
34253,PS3,3,357.84,363.36,5.52,1.0,Used to say sorry like if I hate you exactly so sorry by instant and then in that way does.
34253,PS3,3,363.4,364.28,0.88,3.0,That's first step.
34253,PS3,3,364.96,365.6,0.64,3.0,That's first step.
34253,PS3,3,366.36,367.24,0.88,3.0,That's first step.
34253,PS3,3,367.52,369.36,1.84,3.0,"OK, be patient."
34253,PS3,3,369.36,381.2,11.84,3.0,So I'm just mentioning first step is media and we need to let everyone know that they cannot say sorry and we educate everyone about what are the alternatives that they can use instead of sorry.
34253,PS3,3,381.48,386.68,5.2,3.0,So we encourage people to practice on their their own without infecting other people.
34253,PS3,3,387.68,391.84,4.16,3.0,So that is one way to decrease the chance of it.
34253,PS3,3,392.32,403.52,11.2,3.0,"And then secondly, we put up poster notes, you know, everywhere of like, you know, sorry and then like cross it off."
34253,PS3,3,403.84,412.16,8.32,3.0,So we remind people again and again to not say sorry because we're obviously not cutting off people's tongues and we are.
34253,PS3,3,412.16,420.28,8.12,3.0,"We don't have a vaccine that that can like make people voiceless and people will not willing, will not be willing to take it, obviously."
34253,PS3,3,420.8,423.24,2.44,3.0,So I think media can do.
34253,PS3,3,423.4,431.68,8.28,1.0,"It against their will, we just put it in the supply of the water and when they drink it because obviously everyone drink water right and they just lose their voice."
34253,PS3,3,431.68,438.72,7.04,1.0,"In the meantime, we just, you know, we research on the vaccine and to get this thing done and where where the vaccine is."
34253,PS3,3,439.32,443.36,4.04,3.0,"We want to be serious, really like I think stroking time and I am serious."
34253,PS3,3,443.36,443.88,0.52,3.0,You can't do.
34253,PS3,3,443.92,444.92,1.0,1.0,That I am serious.
34253,PS3,3,444.92,446.12,1.2,1.0,"It's creative, isn't it?"
34253,PS3,3,446.12,446.44,0.32,1.0,It doesn't.
34253,PS3,3,446.6,446.8,0.2,2.0,Matter.
34253,PS3,3,447.32,448.28,0.96,1.0,It doesn't matter it.
34253,PS3,3,448.28,449.04,0.76,3.0,Matters.
34253,PS3,3,449.04,456.96,7.92,3.0,"It matters because it matters because we have to consider how like implementable it is, obviously, but it's not implementable."
34253,PS3,3,456.96,458.96,2.0,3.0,"We just like you kill all humans, you know?"
34253,PS3,3,459.24,460.6,1.36,3.0,And that's like the easy answer.
34253,PS3,3,460.6,466.68,6.08,3.0,"That'd be so easy because, but we want to answer these questions in like the way it's supposed to."
34253,PS3,3,466.68,468.88,2.2,3.0,We need to consider how implementable it.
34253,PS3,3,468.88,470.04,1.16,1.0,Is how many minutes would have.
34253,PS3,3,472.52,473.92,1.4,3.0,"OK, so we should start writing start."
34253,PS3,3,474.4,474.88,0.48,1.0,That writing.
34253,PS3,3,475.24,475.6,0.36,3.0,Sorry.
34253,PS3,3,480.04,481.56,1.52,1.0,So what's our take on this?
34253,PS3,3,483.64,485.32,1.68,3.0,"You're, you're going to write what I said, right?"
34253,PS3,3,485.36,486.16,0.8,3.0,Like a serious answer?
34253,PS3,3,487.08,487.32,0.24,3.0,Of course.
34253,PS3,3,487.32,487.76,0.44,3.0,Thank you.
34253,PS3,3,491.72,493.68,1.96,1.0,Do you not agree on my answer?
34253,PS3,3,493.68,494.6,0.92,1.0,It's great.
34253,PS3,3,495.36,496.96,1.6,3.0,We don't have a vaccine like that.
34253,PS3,3,497.64,499.0,1.36,1.0,"Not a vaccine, we just."
34253,PS3,3,499.0,500.52,1.52,3.0,We don't have a drug like that.
34253,PS3,3,500.88,502.88,2.0,1.0,Maybe they do like scientists.
34253,PS3,3,502.88,503.88,1.0,1.0,They do crazy stuff.
34253,PS3,3,504.6,507.68,3.08,3.0,"Maybe, but I don't think we we have that."
34253,PS3,3,508.32,519.04,10.72,3.0,"And what if it's like a permanent, you know, how do you control the time that the medicine is going to be effective in the human body?"

34253,PS3,3,520.96,528.92,7.96,3.0,And what if like there are people that needs to speak on the news and to like communicate this problem and to keep people updated?
34253,PS3,3,528.92,530.44,1.52,3.0,"They cannot, right."
34253,PS3,3,530.44,530.96,0.52,3.0,So you're.
34253,PS3,3,531.36,534.12,2.76,1.0,Going to use like written.
34253,PS3,3,534.6,534.76,0.16,3.0,What?
34253,PS3,3,534.76,537.08,2.32,3.0,"Yeah, what about all the blind people in this world?"
34253,PS3,3,537.08,538.68,1.6,3.0,How they're going to get any information?
34253,PS3,3,539.32,561.56,22.24,3.0,"So I think there are better ways to be non harmful and be efficient and be educational, although it's not that drastic."
34253,PS3,3,561.64,569.64,8.0,3.0,"You know, it's not that drastic because it says it's a pandemic, but it doesn't say that if you get infected you die immediately."
34253,PS3,3,570.4,572.6,2.2,3.0,So we don't need to take drastic measures.
34253,PS3,3,572.6,579.4,6.8,3.0,"OK, If everyone dies immediately, I'm saying sorry, then I think people will just stop saying it immediately."
34253,PS3,3,580.56,586.68,6.12,3.0,"Like they will see how, you know, important it is to not use this word."
34253,PS3,3,588.92,591.68,2.76,3.0,"It's like, you know, that you shouldn't jump in front of a train."
34253,PS3,3,591.68,594.08,2.4,3.0,So you just don't because you want to live.
34253,PS3,3,594.52,597.28,2.76,3.0,It's it's people are going to learn sooner now.
34253,PS3,3,598.16,601.6,3.44,3.0,So I don't think there's a lot of intervention the government can do.
34253,PS3,3,648.28,648.4,0.12,2.0,OK.
34253,PS3,3,649.64,651.0,1.36,1.0,Let's move on to the next one.
36422,PS3,6,0.16,0.8,0.64,1.0,"Oh, it's too late."
36422,PS3,6,0.8,1.68,0.88,1.0,I start already.
36422,PS3,6,2.04,3.8,1.76,1.0,"OK, Yeah."
36422,PS3,6,4.84,8.0,3.16,2.0,Imagine a new pandemic has language that's transmitted by.
36422,PS3,6,12.04,14.64,2.6,1.0,What kind of questions?
36422,PS3,6,18.04,21.76,3.72,3.0,"Well, I assume that obviously use the word sorry in the English language."
36422,PS3,6,21.96,24.92,2.96,3.0,So does that is it sorry in other languages as well?
36422,PS3,6,24.92,26.36,1.44,3.0,Or is it just the English language?
36422,PS3,6,26.4,30.32,3.92,3.0,"Because it is just in the English language, then it would probably."
36422,PS3,6,30.44,31.88,1.44,1.0,"Be well, the simple answer is to switch that."
36422,PS3,6,32.24,37.12,4.88,3.0,"Dominantly speak English is their primary language, so then you can focus on."
36422,PS3,6,38.24,40.48,2.24,2.0,Like some countries just instead of saying sorry.
36422,PS3,6,40.6,43.76,3.16,1.0,"Saying so, we can assume that first, but that does still mean shall."
36422,PS3,6,43.76,45.68,1.92,4.0,We shall we.
36422,PS3,6,46.0,46.28,0.28,2.0,Replace a.
36422,PS3,6,47.56,48.24,0.68,1.0,Story to thank you.
36422,PS3,6,49.12,49.92,0.8,1.0,But that would be like.
36422,PS3,6,50.4,52.68,2.28,1.0,Would that be ambiguous because because.
36422,PS3,6,53.2,54.72,1.52,2.0,You you step on someone and say thank.
36422,PS3,6,56.8,57.48,0.68,5.0,You exactly I.
36422,PS3,6,57.72,58.4,0.68,2.0,Heard anything that?
36422,PS3,6,58.72,58.84,0.12,3.0,Would.
36422,PS3,6,59.8,60.56,0.76,5.0,Make you say?
36422,PS3,6,60.56,60.96,0.4,2.0,"Sorry, yeah."
36422,PS3,6,61.92,62.44,0.52,1.0,Exactly.
36422,PS3,6,62.84,72.32,9.48,3.0,"But I thought that's hard because you can't always foresee things that are going to happen where you might be like, oh, because like, you might bump into someone."
36422,PS3,6,79.2,85.44,6.24,2.0,"So like one of the one of the ideas I'm thinking about instead of, you know, this story now has to come with communication."
36422,PS3,6,85.44,87.2,1.76,2.0,So instead of that is signed language.
36422,PS3,6,88.84,89.12,0.28,4.0,OK.
36422,PS3,6,89.68,89.88,0.2,2.0,Yeah.

36422,PS3,6,112.08,116.44,4.36,1.0,Of but use of sign language I don't think the grammar should matter.
36422,PS3,6,120.2,124.44,4.24,1.0,"For example, nothing."
36422,PS3,6,130.6,131.32,0.72,3.0,Side maybe in my.
36422,PS3,6,135.48,136.8,1.32,1.0,Side I'm bowing of the head and I'm bowing of head.
36422,PS3,6,136.8,137.4,0.6,1.0,Nothing or just bowing?
36422,PS3,6,138.12,149.64,11.52,1.0,"Yeah, just bowing your head and to replace your hands together, placing your hand."
36422,PS3,6,149.64,151.28,1.64,1.0,"Oh sorry, hands to get with."

36422,PS3,6,174.08,174.72,0.64,5.0,And then so.
36422,PS3,6,181.56,182.32,0.76,2.0,What did that end?
36422,PS3,6,184.08,188.44,4.36,3.0,"You have to, I mean, because we have to come up with one creative idea, conservative one."
36422,PS3,6,189.52,190.8,1.28,3.0,But maybe we need one.
36422,PS3,6,190.8,192.76,1.96,1.0,"OK, but we need we need some way to."
36422,PS3,6,192.76,194.8,2.04,5.0,No one doesn't mean you shouldn't need to.

34336,PS6,6,384.2,390.12,5.92,1.0,"I don't think you need a microphone because the shower, shower head, the shower, the shower room is already pretty loud."
34336,PS6,6,390.12,390.8,0.68,1.0,"Oh, sorry."
34336,PS6,6,390.88,396.92,6.04,3.0,"No, so it's for the idea of each recording and removing the sound of the water."
34336,PS6,6,398.56,398.84,0.28,6.0,We could.
34336,PS6,6,400.64,403.24,2.6,6.0,"I actually like that because I I, I sound disgusting."
34336,PS6,6,403.24,404.04,0.8,1.0,Whenever I step.

34336,PS6,6,448.08,452.44,4.36,6.0,"And also mentioned, should we also mention affordable like it's a, it's a."
34336,PS6,6,452.56,453.64,1.08,3.0,Painless just right after.
34336,PS6,6,453.88,454.8,0.92,5.0,"You cost friendly, yes."
34336,PS6,6,455.36,457.0,1.64,6.0,And a portable gadget.

34677,PS2,3,282.72,283.52,0.8,3.0,To yeah up to the.
34677,PS2,3,283.52,284.52,1.0,2.0,Technical consultants.
34677,PS2,3,285.28,297.2,11.92,3.0,We are not bothered about the implementation vulnerabilities within the supply chain could lead to.
34677,PS2,3,297.92,298.68,0.76,2.0,Uncontrolled.
34677,PS2,3,298.68,301.48,2.8,3.0,Cost and efficient delivery schedules?
34677,PS2,3,303.52,308.44,4.92,3.0,"OK, please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security."
34677,PS2,3,308.84,311.32,2.48,3.0,"It's not creative, but introduce blockchain."
34677,PS2,3,311.92,316.0,4.08,3.0,"From experience, that's what you're supposed to do."
34677,PS2,3,316.24,317.96,1.72,2.0,What do you mean by vulnerabilities?
34677,PS2,3,319.16,320.6,1.44,3.0,Like tampering?
34677,PS2,3,322.32,323.72,1.4,2.0,Kill anyone who tampers.
34677,PS2,3,325.64,325.88,0.24,1.0,Rather.
34677,PS2,3,330.0,333.12,3.12,3.0,Than killing the people you need to creatively stop the.
34677,PS2,3,333.16,336.08,2.92,2.0,Tampering shock.
34677,PS2,3,336.08,344.48,8.4,2.0,"Whoever tampers, if they are late, I'll only get the most short I know."
34677,PS2,3,344.48,345.64,1.16,2.0,Think of something good.
34677,PS2,3,345.64,345.96,0.32,2.0,One of the.
34677,PS2,3,346.48,347.48,1.0,3.0,Thing is tampering.
34677,PS2,3,347.48,357.96,10.48,3.0,"There can be many like DDS, infrastructure, logistics, creative idea to title separation."
34677,PS2,3,358.56,360.4,1.84,2.0,What do you mean by supply insecurity?
34677,PS2,3,360.4,361.68,1.28,2.0,I'm so confused with that.
34677,PS2,3,362.28,363.8,1.52,1.0,"Yeah, it could be a lot of things, right?"
34677,PS2,3,366.44,370.36,3.92,3.0,"Like in the whole supply chain, how can you make it more secure?"
34677,PS2,3,370.36,381.2,10.84,3.0,"OK, from the product delivery like from the shipment from the company till the delivery to the to the consumer?"
34677,PS2,3,384.76,387.8,3.04,2.0,It's such a non creative problem no and I don't know what to do.
34677,PS2,3,388.16,389.72,1.56,3.0,What is so creative about it?
34677,PS2,3,389.92,391.32,1.4,2.0,Make the boxes tamper.
34677,PS2,3,391.36,392.08,0.72,3.0,Attach.
34677,PS2,3,393.92,394.88,0.96,2.0,"Oh yeah, that could be good."
34677,PS2,3,394.88,396.0,1.12,2.0,"Track everything, Yeah."
34677,PS2,3,396.12,397.88,1.76,3.0,"Track IoT, that's what's."
34677,PS2,3,397.88,398.56,0.68,2.0,Being done.
34677,PS2,3,398.6,401.72,3.12,3.0,That's not that's like blockchain does that.
34677,PS2,3,401.72,408.32,6.6,3.0,"Like it'll have UID for everything and once you tamper it, the chain will break."
34677,PS2,3,408.56,410.8,2.24,3.0,So you get to know that it has been tampered.
34677,PS2,3,412.6,414.32,1.72,3.0,But what is creative there?
34677,PS2,3,422.44,426.4,3.96,2.0,Reward people for not tampering instead of punishing them for tampering.
34677,PS2,3,426.4,427.08,0.68,2.0,Maybe something?
34677,PS2,3,427.76,444.68,16.92,3.0,"Or like can we force each delivery guy not force like assign each delivery guy to a product like if he if that is like similar to delivery delivery room, if there is a delay he will lose some salary or something."
34677,PS2,3,446.32,458.24,11.92,3.0,"There is if it is tampered or some, but it won't be like there can be many other vulnerabilities creeping in."
34677,PS2,3,459.4,459.88,0.48,3.0,I don't know.
34677,PS2,3,463.96,465.6,1.64,1.0,Have a sensor in every person.
34677,PS2,3,469.6,474.52,4.92,2.0,"Instead of blockchain on the objects, blockchain on the people, this is."
34677,PS2,3,477.16,480.16,3.0,3.0,"So, technical question."
34677,PS2,3,481.52,482.92,1.4,1.0,You know this is not a creative.
34677,PS2,3,483.36,483.64,0.28,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34677,PS2,3,483.76,492.04,8.28,2.0,I have to use different sides of the brain for different types of things.
34677,PS2,3,492.04,496.96,4.92,2.0,"You know, this is such an irritating place to be creative at."
34677,PS2,3,509.04,511.92,2.88,2.0,"OK, 1 1/2 minutes to think, then we start writing down."
34677,PS2,3,512.64,513.88,1.24,3.0,We have 8 minutes.
34677,PS2,3,514.0,514.68,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, but still."
34677,PS2,3,514.72,523.16,8.44,3.0,Like like what's the what loopholes do you find when we are assigning a person responsible for each delivery?
34677,PS2,3,523.48,532.56,9.08,3.0,"Like if the delivery one delivery is assigned to that person like he is responsible for the entire chain even if it is delayed, tampered or whatever."
34677,PS2,3,532.56,535.4,2.84,3.0,Like according to that he will lose some salute of it.
34677,PS2,3,536.96,539.32,2.36,2.0,"But if he gets it late from the company, then yeah."
34677,PS2,3,539.44,543.88,4.44,1.0,"Yeah, like again it's from supply chain could be like from."
34677,PS2,3,543.96,546.0,2.04,3.0,From the company bond side as well.
34677,PS2,3,546.0,546.44,0.44,3.0,From where?
34677,PS2,3,547.2,548.44,1.24,1.0,From where are we considering?
34677,PS2,3,548.52,549.32,0.8,2.0,Inbound.
34677,PS2,3,551.2,553.4,2.2,3.0,Inbound bound supply chain issues.
34677,PS2,3,555.4,558.32,2.92,3.0,You need to secure inbound supply chain.
34677,PS2,3,558.4,564.8,6.4,2.0,"Give it to one person or one organization outside of yours, outsourcing, whatever they Yeah, actually out."
34677,PS2,3,564.96,567.0,2.04,2.0,But that's not creative at all.
34677,PS2,3,567.52,568.76,1.24,2.0,That's not creative at all.
34677,PS2,3,571.0,572.12,1.12,2.0,Give it to robots.
34677,PS2,3,572.16,574.92,2.76,2.0,Don't they can't tamper only.
34677,PS2,3,575.72,579.88,4.16,2.0,So everything is automated right from the truck delivery to the final delivery.
34677,PS2,3,581.64,585.04,3.4,2.0,"And you can, you can actually put a chip in the robot."
34677,PS2,3,588.24,589.4,1.16,2.0,We don't have any.
34677,PS2,3,589.48,602.2,12.72,2.0,"We don't have a budget limit, no make everything autonomous, just pushing people out of jobs."
34677,PS2,3,602.92,605.04,2.12,1.0,"Yeah, a lot of people supplies."
34677,PS2,3,605.76,606.8,1.04,3.0,Whole supply gym.
34677,PS2,3,609.16,610.24,1.08,2.0,Driving.
34677,PS2,3,610.64,613.2,2.56,3.0,"Already unemployed, but we are making people."
34677,PS2,3,615.92,616.36,0.44,2.0,We.
34677,PS2,3,619.64,620.4,0.76,3.0,Don't get the jobs.
34677,PS2,3,620.44,622.44,2.0,3.0,No one is going to do the jobs.
34677,PS2,3,634.6,635.16,0.56,2.0,Next.
34677,PS2,3,635.16,635.6,0.44,2.0,Next it.
35681,PS5,6,1.8,2.56,0.76,1.0,12 minutes.
35681,PS5,6,3.0,3.36,0.36,1.0,OK.
35681,PS5,6,28.14,52.24,24.1,1.0,"Should we go with employee retention initiatives such as and we bullet point some of them and you can come up with some creative one Shit it is yes, let's be very creative Shit it is."
35681,PS5,6,59.52,70.2,10.68,1.0,"Oh, I mean, I guess we could also state the obvious, but we should come up with some, a couple creative ones."
35681,PS5,6,71.6,84.84,13.24,1.0,"So let's say promotions, benefits."
35681,PS5,6,87.72,88.64,0.92,2.0,Regular reviews.
35681,PS5,6,89.48,89.88,0.4,1.0,"Huh, Regular?"
35681,PS5,6,90.36,91.12,0.76,2.0,Reviews.

35681,PS5,6,92.96,94.72,1.76,3.0,Performance places people work.
35681,PS5,6,95.36,96.28,0.92,2.0,Have you worked in places?
35681,PS5,6,96.44,96.6,0.16,3.0,Where?

35681,PS5,6,106.76,109.52,2.76,3.0,Have they sat with you and gave you feedback about your performance?
35681,PS5,6,109.52,109.64,0.12,3.0,It's.
35681,PS5,6,110.32,111.44,1.12,4.0,"Not really, but."
35681,PS5,6,112.04,114.8,2.76,1.0,Probably just one of.
35681,PS5,6,115.04,115.32,0.28,2.0,My OK.

35681,PS5,6,122.0,123.56,1.56,4.0,How can we make it creative?
35681,PS5,6,124.28,124.48,0.2,5.0,Yeah.
35681,PS5,6,126.88,133.88,7.0,6.0,Maybe everyone can say this one idea and then we can choose some the most creative.
35681,PS5,6,134.12,145.2,11.08,1.0,"One, what about employee loyalty perks such as if you stay for us for three years, we will pay for your bike?"
35681,PS5,6,146.24,153.04,6.8,6.0,"I think we need to know when after the employee leave, where will the person go."
35681,PS5,6,153.04,157.68,4.64,6.0,"If he actually go to another company, then we can collaborate with that company."
35681,PS5,6,157.92,162.6,4.68,6.0,"In this way, the the person is still meeting our community."
35681,PS5,6,166.52,166.6,0.08,4.0,You.
35681,PS5,6,167.28,167.68,0.4,2.0,Can go.
35681,PS5,6,168.88,169.68,0.8,1.0,Ahead survey.
35681,PS5,6,169.92,173.92,4.0,4.0,I think this one is specifically just for that company.
35681,PS5,6,173.92,177.0,3.08,4.0,We have to retain the employee within this company.
35681,PS5,6,177.4,180.68,3.28,4.0,So we have to create ways of making sure that they do not lead.
35681,PS5,6,182.4,188.88,6.48,6.0,"To the but we can also make our company larger, so if we buy the other company then he's still making our."
35681,PS5,6,188.92,189.16,0.24,4.0,Money.
35681,PS5,6,189.84,192.04,2.2,4.0,You have the money to buy that other company.
35681,PS5,6,192.28,196.28,4.0,6.0,"Yeah, just just, we just want to say propose some creative ideas."
35681,PS5,6,196.28,199.56,3.28,6.0,So I think anything can be potential solutions this.
35681,PS5,6,201.24,204.44,3.2,1.0,May come up with ways to avoid their yeah.
35681,PS5,6,204.84,205.68,0.84,4.0,That's a great thing.
35681,PS5,6,205.68,205.92,0.24,4.0,It's good.
35681,PS5,6,205.92,209.76,3.84,4.0,It's a different issue we can come up with ways to avoid.
35681,PS5,6,210.52,214.04,3.52,2.0,There's comments giving people the opportunity to work in other places but like.
35681,PS5,6,214.04,215.32,1.28,3.0,When you're doing your course.
35681,PS5,6,215.8,222.44,6.64,2.0,So the fact that you've come to the to the UK is one part of your you've happened to you've you've you're on.
35681,PS5,6,222.64,225.4,2.76,3.0,"You're here for a part of your course here and then you go back to China, or."
35681,PS5,6,225.84,226.92,1.08,2.0,So some people oxygen.
35681,PS5,6,226.92,231.04,4.12,3.0,"Sorry, OK, but some, some people leave they they spend one year, don't they?"
35681,PS5,6,231.04,232.56,1.52,3.0,Or two years the unit.
35681,PS5,6,232.64,233.8,1.16,2.0,Institution and.
35681,PS5,6,233.8,235.72,1.92,3.0,"Then they go back to their own institution, so they."
35681,PS5,6,235.84,238.4,2.56,2.0,They do succumbments or they do not actually gap year.

35681,PS5,6,241.04,241.8,0.76,3.0,And then they go back.
35681,PS5,6,242.72,244.64,1.92,2.0,Stochastic do some comments elsewhere.
35681,PS5,6,246.32,247.76,1.44,4.0,So will be overall.
35681,PS5,6,247.8,252.84,5.04,5.0,Principles to make to make the company make the the organization more attractive to those I.

35681,PS5,6,255.04,259.24,4.2,4.0,What you're talking about can fall under employee loyalty parts.
35681,PS5,6,259.88,260.4,0.52,2.0,Or benefits.
35681,PS5,6,261.2,265.56,4.36,1.0,"Yeah, I wanted to, but I didn't want to repeat the benefits up there, but OK."
35681,PS5,6,265.92,284.36,18.44,1.0,This can be like a standard employed employment benefits or standard employment benefits and capacity to move departments or or basis work.
35681,PS5,6,284.6,286.56,1.96,2.0,Work shadow the people to get an insight.
35681,PS5,6,286.68,287.16,0.48,1.0,Basis so.
35681,PS5,6,288.12,300.92,12.8,2.0,"Work shadow and you know, so you can have two teams, you can have intra in the organization succumbments and outside the organization succumbments, so intra and inter."
35681,PS5,6,302.64,304.36,1.72,1.0,Like what do you mean what should I write?
35681,PS5,6,304.84,314.44,9.6,2.0,"So I suppose under the under the headings, succumbments sort of internal and external, so under the headings of common, so sometimes people you can move to another department that the organization is quite big."
35681,PS5,6,314.72,319.32,4.6,2.0,"So in your world, you could do maybe move to another hospital outside, yeah."
35681,PS5,6,319.6,319.88,0.28,1.0,Or else.
35681,PS5,6,320.24,323.8,3.56,2.0,Translate to another department where you're you know where you're getting exposure.
35681,PS5,6,323.8,324.68,0.88,2.0,I haven't been working with.
35681,PS5,6,325.2,329.32,4.12,4.0,I think it would even be best like if you're getting exposure outside your.
35681,PS5,6,329.32,330.88,1.56,2.0,"Country, yes."
35681,PS5,6,331.32,333.24,1.92,4.0,"Yeah, it gives a lot of exposure."
35681,PS5,6,333.44,333.84,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35681,PS5,6,335.68,335.8,0.12,4.0,And.
35681,PS5,6,336.68,336.92,0.24,6.0,It is.
35681,PS5,6,337.0,339.24,2.24,4.0,"More, more, more morale and motivation."
35681,PS5,6,341.8,344.92,3.12,2.0,May it be interesting if we asked each of us what would keep people here?
35681,PS5,6,345.32,347.52,2.2,2.0,What what would the viewing work for an organization?
35681,PS5,6,347.68,348.8,1.12,2.0,What would stop you leaving?
35681,PS5,6,348.8,350.88,2.08,2.0,What would be the one thing that would stop you leaving at?
35681,PS5,6,352.16,361.12,8.96,4.0,"The end of the day, I think also the management, how they prepare with the the rest of the the people that work with them."
35681,PS5,6,361.84,362.12,0.28,2.0,Also.
35681,PS5,6,362.76,366.0,3.24,4.0,Matters because if you have a root.
35681,PS5,6,367.64,367.76,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35681,PS5,6,367.96,373.64,5.68,4.0,I think someone that doesn't talk most things want to work with them.
35681,PS5,6,375.04,377.04,2.0,6.0,"For me, I think my family's important."
35681,PS5,6,377.04,383.24,6.2,6.0,"If my family's stays in the same city as me, then I think I prefer to stay here."
35681,PS5,6,386.68,387.88,1.2,5.0,External factors.
35681,PS5,6,389.4,390.28,0.88,4.0,Have you mentioned it?
35681,PS5,6,391.44,394.44,3.0,2.0,"It's a bloody organizational culture, that's what you're saying."
35681,PS5,6,395.44,395.76,0.32,2.0,Sorry.
35681,PS5,6,395.88,396.56,0.68,2.0,"What's your name, Sir?"
35681,PS5,6,396.84,397.44,0.6,1.0,I'm Roy.
35681,PS5,6,397.64,400.28,2.64,2.0,"Roy, I don't know how to capture organization of culture."
35681,PS5,6,400.6,402.2,1.6,1.0,I guess that's really important.
35681,PS5,6,402.2,403.36,1.16,1.0,I will put it up here.
35681,PS5,6,405.56,406.28,0.72,2.0,People leave them.
35681,PS5,6,406.6,408.28,1.68,2.0,Leave the boss to don't leave the organization.
35681,PS5,6,410.88,411.6,0.72,1.0,We've talked about.
35681,PS5,6,418.84,420.36,1.52,4.0,Many creative ideas.
35681,PS5,6,421.04,422.28,1.24,1.0,"OK, OK."
35681,PS5,6,422.28,423.2,0.92,1.0,This up onto.
35681,PS5,6,424.28,429.44,5.16,1.0,So I guess the one idea would be employee retention initiatives.
35681,PS5,6,434.32,435.32,1.0,1.0,What creative?
35681,PS5,6,435.44,435.6,0.16,1.0,What?
35681,PS5,6,436.16,439.64,3.48,2.0,"Would be the best employee retention initiative because it's very broad, isn't it?"
35681,PS5,6,440.92,441.52,0.6,2.0,We're copping out.
35681,PS5,6,441.52,442.24,0.72,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35681,PS5,6,443.28,450.64,7.36,2.0,What would be the most the the the one the one team that would?
35681,PS5,6,470.81,475.65,4.84,1.0,"I think it's still, I mean, I don't think where."
35681,PS5,6,478.21,479.65,1.44,1.0,"Oh yeah, thank you."
35681,PS5,6,483.01,483.49,0.48,1.0,I don't know.
35681,PS5,6,483.49,490.8,7.31,1.0,"I feel like if we said like maybe 1 of this bullet points as our one creative idea, it's not strong enough."
35681,PS5,6,490.84,502.24,11.4,1.0,"I think that the one creative idea is to create a plan for employee retention initiatives comprising this because otherwise, I don't think that any single of these can actually stop people from leaving."
35681,PS5,6,505.68,507.32,1.64,1.0,So I think this is good.
35681,PS5,6,507.52,540.56,33.04,1.0,"If anybody wants to add anything else to it, I'm up with ways to avoid them leaving and reiterate on the the left to make our retention plan more robust."
35681,PS5,6,551.4,559.16,7.76,1.0,Anything more creative that we want to add so next?
35681,PS5,6,559.56,561.44,1.88,2.0,"Oh no, I I think there's something about just."
35681,PS5,6,561.68,562.12,0.44,5.0,Run out of the.
35681,PS5,6,562.56,570.92,8.36,2.0,"Time I think, well, I just think there's something around letting the people shape the culture because the people shape the culture, then you have a better chance of people staying."
35681,PS5,6,571.68,585.56,13.88,2.0,"So for me, that's I don't, you know, if no one ever asks you, how are you getting on, which is I'm guessing your experience outside your supervision, People live."
35681,PS5,6,587.52,593.12,5.6,1.0,So I'm interested to hear what people take.
35681,PS5,6,593.72,595.32,1.6,1.0,Organizational culture take you.
35681,PS5,6,598.88,599.92,1.04,4.0,Can look at what?
35681,PS5,6,600.72,601.32,0.6,1.0,You're saying take more.
35681,PS5,6,601.32,607.6,6.28,1.0,"So it would be under what you said, it would be under improving organizational culture because."
35681,PS5,6,608.68,611.08,2.4,2.0,Some greater staff involvement in shaping culture.
35681,PS5,6,612.08,612.28,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35681,PS5,6,613.08,613.2,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
35681,PS5,6,614.64,627.08,12.44,1.0,Involvement in shaping a positive working culture.
35681,PS5,6,627.96,631.36,3.4,1.0,"Do we want to expand on any of these, Maybe a little bit?"
35681,PS5,6,632.52,635.68,3.16,4.0,He also missed the P on timely promotions.
35681,PS5,6,637.56,662.68,25.12,1.0,"Oh yeah, why am I missing the first letters of satisfaction surveys general workforce manager guy on management strategy like make?"
35681,PS5,6,665.2,668.44,3.24,5.0,Make some excellent employees as.
35681,PS5,6,668.88,670.4,1.52,1.0,"Right, like employee of the month."
35681,PS5,6,670.44,672.96,2.52,5.0,Examples to all the stuff.
35681,PS5,6,673.52,675.0,1.48,5.0,"Just give some, give them some."
35681,PS5,6,675.2,676.72,1.52,2.0,Reputation and stuff.
35681,PS5,6,679.0,679.88,0.88,2.0,Culture champions.
35681,PS5,6,680.96,686.84,5.88,1.0,So culture champions should I champions?
35681,PS5,6,688.88,691.76,2.88,2.0,"So to point your point about excellent employee, sorry."
35681,PS5,6,693.36,707.86,14.5,5.0,"Just like to show that oh, they are excellent examples for you guys and just probably people need some reputation and like."
35681,PS5,6,709.3,709.5,0.2,4.0,You know.
35681,PS5,6,710.22,712.9,2.68,5.0,"To some, to to some extent satisfy their."
35681,PS5,6,712.9,715.98,3.08,4.0,Vanity so.
35681,PS5,6,716.58,717.46,0.88,1.0,Just great.
36387,PS6,3,11.62,12.82,1.2,1.0,Imagine a new research.
36387,PS6,3,16.82,17.98,1.16,2.0,20 minutes in shower.
36387,PS6,3,18.78,19.78,1.0,3.0,"Yeah, 20 minutes."
36387,PS6,3,19.78,20.02,0.24,3.0,It's.
36387,PS6,3,20.46,22.14,1.68,1.0,Doing that the.
36387,PS6,3,22.54,23.14,0.6,2.0,Water bill.
36387,PS6,3,23.54,27.58,4.04,1.0,"Yeah, and this is relevant only where water is in excess."
36387,PS6,3,28.32,31.0,2.68,2.0,"If war is like, not an issue, that's the war."
36387,PS6,3,31.0,36.56,5.56,2.0,"If war like war, there's no issue because 20 minutes to show is crazy."
36387,PS6,3,37.84,38.88,1.04,3.0,That is so.
36387,PS6,3,40.04,42.04,2.0,2.0,How do you encourage people to do this?
36387,PS6,3,44.6,52.52,7.92,2.0,"OK, I think this will probably spoiler along the lines of the Mojibola."
36387,PS6,3,53.16,53.76,0.6,2.0,Like the app.
36387,PS6,3,53.8,56.36,2.56,2.0,You know how you have like like Shazam?
36387,PS6,3,56.44,67.92,11.48,2.0,"Something like Shazam, but like, you know, before you go in the shower, you kind of like go on the app and you click like the middle, you're fine."
36387,PS6,3,68.04,70.16,2.12,2.0,"And then you're in the shower, you sing for 20 minutes."
36387,PS6,3,70.44,87.16,16.72,2.0,"And then you could offer like incentive buys, like rewards, that type of thing where like, you know, if you complete that, say 5 off 7 days in a week, you get like coupons or something like shopping coupons, I suppose that type of thing."
36387,PS6,3,90.08,90.64,0.56,3.0,I like it.
36387,PS6,3,91.44,98.56,7.12,1.0,But how to make sure that they are doing it only during summer time?
36387,PS6,3,99.0,99.64,0.64,2.0,Then shower.
36387,PS6,3,102.08,105.24,3.16,1.0,"To encourage people to this, it's."
36387,PS6,3,108.8,110.0,1.2,3.0,Always about resources.
36387,PS6,3,110.04,112.4,2.36,3.0,I mean like just roughing off your idea.
36387,PS6,3,112.4,119.96,7.56,3.0,"It's like it's a like the council, the government can still like a sort of a sit."
36387,PS6,3,120.48,131.12,10.64,3.0,"No, this is kind of gets weird, like maybe a measure in the shower and it links to your app and then if you you sync for 20 minutes, then you get a deduction of your water bill."
36387,PS6,3,131.4,134.6,3.2,3.0,"Then I don't know, but then it runs the privacy issues."
36387,PS6,3,136.0,136.32,0.32,2.0,It's just.
36387,PS6,3,136.32,137.92,1.6,3.0,A private place before the shower.
36387,PS6,3,140.24,140.56,0.32,3.0,But it's.
36387,PS6,3,141.04,142.84,1.8,3.0,"I like the idea of like, yeah, like."
36387,PS6,3,143.16,143.6,0.44,2.0,The reward?
36387,PS6,3,143.6,144.4,0.8,3.0,"System, yeah."
36387,PS6,3,148.64,156.48,7.84,2.0,"Because I mean, if they, if they weren't like honest with it, how do you know is the other aspect of it?"
36387,PS6,3,156.48,158.76,2.28,2.0,"I don't know if you should like worry about that, but."
36387,PS6,3,159.8,167.24,7.44,1.0,"OK, so there's been more thing I can think of so we can do."
36387,PS6,3,173.76,189.68,15.92,1.0,Now gift them something like speaker like music that will be installed in all the washrooms like your bathroom and there will be a music and then you go to go for a bath.
36387,PS6,3,191.52,197.28,5.76,1.0,"So OK, and you can sing along that time."
36387,PS6,3,198.28,200.32,2.04,2.0,"Yeah, but that's a good idea."
36387,PS6,3,200.48,205.64,5.16,2.0,"Well, I don't know, like people these days are so like sceptical of my friends."
36387,PS6,3,205.64,217.32,11.68,2.0,"Like if you know, today someone came out saying this and then like speakers specifically, they're going to be like, see, this is what we're trying to warn you guys about the government, blah, blah, blah, blah."
36387,PS6,3,217.32,221.84,4.52,2.0,"Like you don't know when it's listening to you, when it's not listening to you during a show up time."
36387,PS6,3,222.68,224.2,1.52,2.0,So that type of thing.
36387,PS6,3,224.8,225.6,0.8,2.0,That's a good idea.
36387,PS6,3,225.6,230.2,4.6,2.0,Like good concept or just how they receive this kind of like the war has been.
36387,PS6,3,230.68,235.44,4.76,3.0,This is a hilarious idea but it would only work in like a country like North Korea or something.
36387,PS6,3,235.84,250.4,14.56,3.0,"Some like like autocratic country, but like the the shower head has like a microphone and in order to actually get hot water you have to sing and the moment you stop singing it goes cold."
36387,PS6,3,252.76,264.04,11.28,1.0,"That's wonderful, but anything like technical thing, your say electronic thing in shower room concerns privacy."
36387,PS6,3,264.76,266.08,1.32,1.0,"It's a microphone, right?"
36387,PS6,3,266.8,288.32,21.52,1.0,"You can record, and that's creative idea by the way, that if you don't sing anything for like if you detect silence for say continuously 2030 second, it will either stop or change the water temperature."
36387,PS6,3,288.72,289.24,0.52,1.0,That's good idea.
36387,PS6,3,289.56,290.32,0.76,1.0,That's good idea.
36387,PS6,3,291.0,292.44,1.44,3.0,"Yeah, it's a bit cruel."
36387,PS6,3,292.44,295.0,2.56,3.0,"It's a bit of like that, that there's a carrot in the stick approach."
36387,PS6,3,295.0,296.04,1.04,3.0,It's just kind of a sticker.
36387,PS6,3,296.04,296.76,0.72,1.0,"You, you have to."
36387,PS6,3,297.36,299.44,2.08,1.0,"It's not encouraging, it's forcing."
36387,PS6,3,299.64,301.32,1.68,3.0,"It's forcing, yeah, that's the thing."
36387,PS6,3,301.32,302.6,1.28,3.0,It's not a guy it's making.
36387,PS6,3,302.6,302.68,0.08,1.0,It.
36387,PS6,3,304.68,307.32,2.64,3.0,"At least, yeah, I guess the definition of excitement."
36387,PS6,3,307.52,320.0,12.48,1.0,"Generally whenever it comes to encouragement, mostly people do it when there is reward, and when it comes to punishment, it is done mostly by force."
36387,PS6,3,321.12,323.32,2.2,1.0,"So reward, yeah, like."
36387,PS6,3,323.8,324.04,0.24,2.0,How?
36387,PS6,3,325.32,327.0,1.68,3.0,"I I yeah, I think that's a good point."
36387,PS6,3,328.32,330.56,2.24,3.0,Encouragement is more kind of like the carrot.
36387,PS6,3,332.04,332.88,0.84,3.0,Here's an idea.
36387,PS6,3,333.16,334.4,1.24,3.0,What if you gamified it?

36132,PS6,3,147.24,151.28,4.04,1.0,And the shower won't turn off until you finish the four songs.

36474,PS5,3,28.2,30.48,2.28,1.0,"Work, yeah."
36474,PS5,3,33.16,34.32,1.16,2.0,It's the honest answer.
36474,PS5,3,36.44,37.12,0.68,1.0,2 words pale.
36474,PS5,3,39.6,47.24,7.64,2.0,"Maybe like a reward scheme in a sense that like if you know your worth, like if your worth is recognised."
36474,PS5,3,47.24,52.76,5.52,2.0,"Because I feel like people leave when they're like, I'm worth more than this and you're not accepting that."
36474,PS5,3,53.12,66.2,13.08,2.0,"So maybe if there was like within the workplace, there was this regular sort of like test, almost like audit and you were given like a skills score."
36474,PS5,3,66.4,69.6,3.2,2.0,"I don't know, maybe."
36474,PS5,3,77.32,77.48,0.16,1.0,To.
36474,PS5,3,77.68,78.24,0.56,1.0,Is it just to?
36474,PS5,3,79.2,81.04,1.84,2.0,Reduce it from happening.
36474,PS5,3,81.04,93.88,12.84,2.0,"So it's like to encourage someone to stay in their job, basically unclad contracts, these overwhelming legal barriers."
36474,PS5,3,97.64,98.6,0.96,1.0,Non compete.
36474,PS5,3,99.8,114.92,15.12,2.0,"Maybe maybe like some sort of like, yeah, maybe kind of rephrasing it, but like like a reward scheme where it's like you just, there's these like little almost like incentives along the way."
36474,PS5,3,115.52,123.76,8.24,2.0,"So like on your career path, it's like, but if you stick at it longer, you get a prize, you stick at it longer, you get another prize."
36474,PS5,3,124.76,127.8,3.04,2.0,"I don't know, like you needed a carrot rather."
36474,PS5,3,127.8,128.76,0.96,1.0,"Than stick, it's true."
36474,PS5,3,129.28,129.64,0.36,1.0,"Well, actually."
36474,PS5,3,129.64,134.24,4.6,3.0,People leave their original work to find another one trying to you know they already have a.
36474,PS5,3,134.6,134.88,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,134.88,136.28,1.4,1.0,It's like a bonus salary.
36474,PS5,3,136.44,136.72,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,136.72,143.24,6.52,1.0,Kind of like the prospect of that or like when you're working somewhere for five years and they give you like a five year gift sort of thing.
36474,PS5,3,143.84,156.04,12.2,2.0,"Or maybe something like introduce a framework where if you are quitting your job, you have like you have to undergo a sort of review meeting of that decision."
36474,PS5,3,157.08,164.4,7.32,2.0,"And in that review meeting that's sort of, I don't know, like you can't, you can't persuade them to stay."
36474,PS5,3,165.32,171.16,5.84,1.0,"But at that point, though, they probably like, you don't have a job or just like, I'm done."
36474,PS5,3,171.44,171.8,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,171.84,173.64,1.8,1.0,"I feel like at that point, it's very hard."
36474,PS5,3,174.56,175.08,0.52,1.0,Just stop.
36474,PS5,3,175.08,177.6,2.52,1.0,I feel like it has to be like an earlier intervention.
36474,PS5,3,178.04,178.16,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,180.4,183.36,2.96,2.0,"So it's like, you've got to do something before they become disenfranchised."
36474,PS5,3,183.64,184.0,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,184.04,185.56,1.52,2.0,How do you stop someone being?
36474,PS5,3,185.56,186.16,0.6,1.0,Disenfranchised.
36474,PS5,3,186.8,187.44,0.64,1.0,That's a deep one.
36474,PS5,3,192.52,193.52,1.0,1.0,Creative idea.
36474,PS5,3,194.0,201.56,7.56,2.0,"I'm so I was like, well, if you become disenfranchised with your job, it's because you ultimately don't like it."
36474,PS5,3,202.04,218.6,16.56,2.0,"So if there was a way of assessing almost like some sort of like personality test, where it's like you might be hired for the job, but you also have to go through a personality test, which essentially gives you a score of how likely you are to enjoy that job and stick at it."
36474,PS5,3,218.8,220.0,1.2,2.0,And you're given that information.
36474,PS5,3,220.0,223.48,3.48,2.0,"And with that information, you can then choose if you actually want to take up the job."
36474,PS5,3,223.48,223.8,0.32,1.0,Offer.
36474,PS5,3,223.84,225.4,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, that's actually yeah from the get go."
36474,PS5,3,225.88,239.24,13.36,2.0,"And then you, and then it's like, you almost have this almost like scientific proof that this is the right job for you because this model that's so wonderfully trained with global data can say this is a good job for you."
36474,PS5,3,239.88,245.72,5.84,2.0,"And then it's like, oh, well, maybe it won't get any even if you do have a slump or you're like, oh, this is crap."
36474,PS5,3,245.72,252.4,6.68,2.0,"Then you go yes, but but the data says that actually anything else I went to would be worse."
36474,PS5,3,254.68,255.72,1.04,2.0,I don't know so this.
36474,PS5,3,257.64,261.0,3.36,1.0,Is nothing but I mean just a Black Mirror thing.
36474,PS5,3,261.36,261.72,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, I know."
36474,PS5,3,261.72,264.08,2.36,1.0,"I was like, but I do like the idea of something at the beginning."
36474,PS5,3,264.08,281.0,16.92,1.0,"Like I wonder if there's a way to like maybe periodically it's like you, you get to like job shadow or it's like take your kids to work day."
36474,PS5,3,281.0,287.08,6.08,1.0,But like as an adult where you get to like try and like experience different roles for like a week.
36474,PS5,3,287.84,293.28,5.44,1.0,So it's like it kind of shows you what the next step could look like and it gives you a taster.
36474,PS5,3,293.28,296.76,3.48,1.0,"So then it's like, OK, I can go back to my manager and be like, I'm interested in doing this."
36474,PS5,3,296.76,301.52,4.76,1.0,"Like now that I've done a week here and a week here and a week here, like I really think this is my next step."
36474,PS5,3,301.8,302.92,1.12,2.0,"So yeah, that's cool."
36474,PS5,3,302.92,309.96,7.04,2.0,So like almost like having a a job where you have like a like placement rotation.
36474,PS5,3,309.96,311.64,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, so like like in my."
36474,PS5,3,311.72,312.28,0.56,2.0,"Phone, yeah."
36474,PS5,3,312.8,319.04,6.24,1.0,"It's like you do 4 performance, except yeah, you're already in the workplace and like it's you're doing like a week, so you're not taking too much away."
36474,PS5,3,319.04,319.44,0.4,3.0,From.
36474,PS5,3,319.64,323.0,3.36,1.0,"Yeah, your team, but you're still getting to learn and grow."
36474,PS5,3,323.08,324.84,1.76,1.0,"Yeah, I don't know."
36474,PS5,3,325.24,326.48,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, I like that."
36474,PS5,3,326.52,329.2,2.68,2.0,I can't think of anything else.
36474,PS5,3,329.92,330.6,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, I think."
36474,PS5,3,331.88,333.04,1.16,3.0,It's like far away from.
36474,PS5,3,333.28,334.08,0.8,2.0,"That, yeah."
36474,PS5,3,335.0,335.96,0.96,2.0,"OK, well, maybe we do that."
36474,PS5,3,335.96,353.52,17.56,2.0,"So, OK, I'm going to say, OK, we believe that early intervention, that early intervention to prevent a worker."
36474,PS5,3,353.72,354.04,0.32,1.0,From.
36474,PS5,3,354.28,356.4,2.12,2.0,Becoming dis.
36474,PS5,3,357.76,360.64,2.88,2.0,Is it disenfranchised or disenfranchised?
36474,PS5,3,361.8,362.32,0.52,2.0,It's not the word.
36474,PS5,3,362.44,362.8,0.36,2.0,I don't know.
36474,PS5,3,362.84,363.12,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,363.24,363.88,0.64,1.0,Disenfranchised.
36474,PS5,3,364.8,379.4,14.6,2.0,"With I'm so bad at that from becoming disenfranchised with the job, we believe that early intervention to prevent work from disenfranchised with their job is the best way to prevent them ultimately leaving."
36474,PS5,3,382.88,392.36,9.48,2.0,"We propose that in any professional role role, the first induction."
36474,PS5,3,395.08,395.6,0.52,1.0,No.
36474,PS5,3,403.2,403.56,0.36,2.0,Induction.
36474,PS5,3,403.68,410.52,6.84,2.0,Should involve a sort of placement rotation scheme well.
36474,PS5,3,411.32,413.48,2.16,1.0,I was going to say actually not the first induction.
36474,PS5,3,413.48,415.68,2.2,1.0,But like oh for like 1.
36474,PS5,3,415.68,417.24,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, like you're already, you're in."
36474,PS5,3,418.68,419.0,0.32,1.0,It this is.
36474,PS5,3,419.12,419.48,0.36,2.0,The Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,420.4,422.84,2.44,1.0,And then like 2 years out of line when you're like doing the same thing over.
36474,PS5,3,422.84,429.6,6.76,2.0,"You go, you go through it again, maybe we have it at the start and then you have it on a regular basis, like after every two years you go back on this."
36474,PS5,3,429.72,431.04,1.32,1.0,Thing freshen up.
36474,PS5,3,431.36,432.32,0.96,1.0,What's going on here?
36474,PS5,3,432.32,433.6,1.28,1.0,What are the different departments doing?
36474,PS5,3,433.88,435.48,1.6,1.0,What would be of interest as to their next step?
36474,PS5,3,435.68,436.16,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,436.16,436.96,0.8,2.0,"Oh, I like this."
36474,PS5,3,436.96,438.8,1.84,2.0,"OK, so place it on the rotation scheme."
36474,PS5,3,439.16,448.28,9.12,2.0,You would then repeat this regularly at brackets.
36474,PS5,3,449.32,450.76,1.44,2.0,Where's the approx symbol?
36474,PS5,3,451.72,456.72,5.0,2.0,I can't wait approx 2 year intervals.
36474,PS5,3,458.4,483.04,24.64,2.0,This would allow a person to experience different departments or roles and slash roles give them a sense of the spaces for growth within a company for growth development within a company without leaving it.
36474,PS5,3,485.4,485.76,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,486.44,486.68,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36474,PS5,3,488.64,491.76,3.12,2.0,Anything else or sounds good.
36474,PS5,3,491.76,492.28,0.52,2.0,That's good.
36474,PS5,3,493.32,493.76,0.44,2.0,Nice.
36316,PS5,3,13.28,15.8,2.52,1.0,"Wait, so is it when?"
36316,PS5,3,21.16,24.6,3.44,2.0,"Sorry, I didn't totally understand what the question is about."
36316,PS5,3,25.04,29.36,4.32,1.0,I think it's basically like reduction of valued talent.
36316,PS5,3,29.52,41.76,12.24,1.0,"Does that mean that the employer will say, OK, we need only 10 people and the talented people are here, the two additional ones are not that talented, so?"
36316,PS5,3,42.52,43.64,1.12,3.0,You just like you.
36316,PS5,3,43.68,44.56,0.88,1.0,Just like.
36316,PS5,3,45.2,47.76,2.56,3.0,"Relieve the world by yourself, like by your own will."
36316,PS5,3,48.16,49.64,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
36316,PS5,3,49.64,53.8,4.16,1.0,"Basically, what can we do?"
36316,PS5,3,54.12,57.72,3.6,3.0,To stop the voluntary and poetry.
36316,PS5,3,58.8,60.4,1.6,1.0,Voluntary and politician.
36316,PS5,3,60.44,67.72,7.28,1.0,"OK, that's a tricky 1."
36316,PS5,3,75.04,76.92,1.88,1.0,We just wrapped in bullet points as well.
36316,PS5,3,77.2,78.72,1.52,3.0,"Yeah, we don't need to like REST."
36316,PS5,3,79.72,88.0,8.28,1.0,So do you have any ideas and I pray you just sort through the company resulting in the reduction of valued talent.
36316,PS5,3,89.44,94.16,4.72,1.0,"Wait, reduction of a valued talent in the workforce?"
36316,PS5,3,94.32,102.2,7.88,1.0,"What does that exactly mean, Like in general in the workforce or in the company that they're currently in, I think."
36316,PS5,3,102.2,105.84,3.64,3.0,Like they lose 1 like talent people to work for them.
36316,PS5,3,105.84,108.6,2.76,3.0,Is it kind of can understand that like this?
36316,PS5,3,108.6,117.6,9.0,2.0,I think maybe some some factors in fact the people to decide to leave this company and the company have to stop them to leave.
36316,PS5,3,118.68,119.64,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, Yeah, I think so."
36316,PS5,3,119.8,120.24,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36316,PS5,3,120.24,121.76,1.52,2.0,Maybe just increase the salary?
36316,PS5,3,124.36,124.6,0.24,3.0,That's why.
36316,PS5,3,124.72,125.0,0.28,3.0,"OK, Yeah."
36316,PS5,3,125.2,132.24,7.04,1.0,"Yeah, we'll just you, we'll just then we can always like delete some and ask what the employer."
36316,PS5,3,132.24,135.6,3.36,3.0,Wants like like what's the current situation?
36316,PS5,3,135.88,147.16,11.28,3.0,He or she doesn't satisfy like and then kind of depend on that and then improve the like the working benefits for that.
36316,PS5,3,148.0,148.48,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,148.48,157.0,8.52,1.0,"So financial benefits as well as other benefits, so like well-being."
36316,PS5,3,170.24,185.84,15.6,2.0,"I think 2 points is enough, maybe because we have to finish it."
36316,PS5,3,186.12,187.8,1.68,2.0,"Oh no, no, no, we still."
36316,PS5,3,188.36,188.84,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
36316,PS5,3,189.24,193.28,4.04,1.0,"We can submit it earlier, but I think we need to come up with a more complex."
36316,PS5,3,198.36,208.04,9.68,2.0,"So I think if there are a lot of person decide to leave this company, at the same time there are something happened maybe in the company, yeah, maybe just."
36316,PS5,3,209.64,211.04,1.4,3.0,And then how can we like stop?
36316,PS5,3,211.16,219.36,8.2,2.0,"The maybe, maybe I, I, I mean that maybe they're the leader, maybe the middle of the leader."
36316,PS5,3,220.56,220.92,0.36,1.0,So.
36316,PS5,3,221.2,223.28,2.08,3.0,"If it is like kind of like survey, how?"
36316,PS5,3,223.84,224.04,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,224.2,225.08,0.88,2.0,What happens?
36316,PS5,3,225.72,230.04,4.32,2.0,Maybe deliver service to the persons who want to leave.
36316,PS5,3,230.76,230.96,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,231.84,233.76,1.92,2.0,"Yeah, maybe that's the reason."
36316,PS5,3,233.76,236.28,2.52,2.0,"If their reasons are different, that's fine."
36316,PS5,3,236.32,241.16,4.84,2.0,"If their reasons are the same one as in there, there is a point that the company should deal with."
36316,PS5,3,241.64,241.96,0.32,1.0,Right.
36316,PS5,3,242.28,248.6,6.32,1.0,I think it should also like the employers need to have one-on-one discussions with that person.
36316,PS5,3,249.4,249.56,0.16,2.0,About.
36316,PS5,3,249.96,250.64,0.68,1.0,What happened?
36316,PS5,3,250.64,267.24,16.6,1.0,"Because it can be very individual if they have just like one-on-one discussions with the with the employer, someone in the company, they can understand very well what is going on, what are the underlying effects and then maybe uncover a common issue."
36316,PS5,3,267.24,272.84,5.6,1.0,"So like if three people voluntarily leave at the same time, then something must have happened."
36316,PS5,3,273.88,276.76,2.88,1.0,So maybe like that?
36316,PS5,3,277.64,287.92,10.28,3.0,"Yes, like to yeah, to know like what's the situation's happening and whether there's some like issues in the company."
36316,PS5,3,288.2,290.68,2.48,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely."
36316,PS5,3,296.16,298.36,2.2,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea.
36316,PS5,3,298.36,299.12,0.76,1.0,"Wait, but it can."
36316,PS5,3,299.16,301.56,2.4,1.0,It has to be like one creative idea.
36316,PS5,3,301.56,303.12,1.56,3.0,So I think like we have got.
36316,PS5,3,303.56,309.8,6.24,1.0,"3 Well, The thing is I, I think we need to like incorporate that into one."
36316,PS5,3,309.8,312.84,3.04,1.0,So like a mechanism to stop it.
36316,PS5,3,313.84,322.4,8.56,1.0,"So not like to listen, can you connect, make sure that it's connected."
36316,PS5,3,332.16,350.72,18.56,1.0,So the company should increase the financial benefits as well as well-being and but what are the Please come up with one creative idea to stop voluntary employee attrition.
36316,PS5,3,354.72,359.2,4.48,1.0,So basically what to do so that employees do not leave the company?
36316,PS5,3,360.32,364.28,3.96,1.0,Creating the work environment is definitely one thing.
36316,PS5,3,364.56,365.48,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, just."
36316,PS5,3,367.16,372.68,5.52,1.0,"Making sure that Yeah, the reasons are quite similar."
36316,PS5,3,372.84,373.12,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,373.12,375.52,2.4,1.0,I think you're missing some letters.
36316,PS5,3,377.08,378.12,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, it just finished writing."
36316,PS5,3,378.12,378.64,0.52,1.0,"Sorry, Sorry."
36316,PS5,3,378.64,379.2,0.56,1.0,That's my bad.
36316,PS5,3,379.2,380.72,1.52,1.0,I don't want to interrupt you.
36316,PS5,3,380.72,383.84,3.12,1.0,That's similar.
36316,PS5,3,383.88,385.24,1.36,1.0,That's the point that I'm.
36316,PS5,3,385.88,394.28,8.4,3.0,Finished and also like kind of like improve the and make the working environments more flexible.
36316,PS5,3,394.28,399.04,4.76,3.0,Kind of like have several day work from home if like could be more.
36316,PS5,3,399.64,400.52,0.88,1.0,Yes.
36316,PS5,3,400.52,401.08,0.56,3.0,Encouraged.
36316,PS5,3,401.64,410.48,8.84,1.0,"To have the yeah, OK, yeah, I think in this after the sentence we can put like approachable management team."
36316,PS5,3,410.68,423.0,12.32,1.0,"So like they feel they, they, they should feel like they can talk to the managers, they can talk to the leaders of their teams about their problems."
36316,PS5,3,423.0,438.4,15.4,1.0,"Because if they are unapproachable, that would result that will ultimately result in them like leaving because as opposed to dealing with the problems with the current company, they will just like voluntarily."
36316,PS5,3,441.0,444.8,3.8,2.0,So it should be in the Third Point or the the well-being point.
36316,PS5,3,445.84,447.24,1.4,2.0,So approachable management team.
36316,PS5,3,447.24,448.6,1.36,1.0,Approachable management team.
36316,PS5,3,448.6,451.96,3.36,1.0,"I thought that would be the third one, the third one because they."
36316,PS5,3,451.96,452.64,0.68,2.0,Because it's the.
36316,PS5,3,452.64,453.0,0.36,1.0,Discussion.
36316,PS5,3,453.0,460.52,7.52,1.0,"That's the one-on-one discussion, maybe even after the one-on-one discussion if you pasted that, yeah."
36316,PS5,3,460.84,461.04,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,464.04,464.96,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, perfect."
36316,PS5,3,478.28,481.76,3.48,1.0,"I would say deal with it immediately, not in the future."
36316,PS5,3,482.52,484.0,1.48,2.0,"No, in the immediately right."
36316,PS5,3,488.88,491.04,2.16,1.0,And then what else?
36316,PS5,3,492.36,493.92,1.56,1.0,"Something creative, Something like?"
36316,PS5,3,494.44,496.68,2.24,1.0,Because those are all quite.
36316,PS5,3,497.12,501.96,4.84,2.0,And one thing is that we have to see the persons do do not want to leave.
36316,PS5,3,503.04,510.64,7.6,2.0,"So maybe we can ask the reasons why they want to leave, why they want to work here maybe."
36316,PS5,3,511.08,511.84,0.76,3.0,Kind of like.
36316,PS5,3,511.92,515.32,3.4,1.0,Kind of like remind them or maybe maybe to avoid them?
36316,PS5,3,515.64,516.08,0.44,2.0,"Too, No."
36316,PS5,3,517.08,517.36,0.28,1.0,No.
36316,PS5,3,517.4,520.16,2.76,1.0,"So like if they want to leave, they can't just leave."
36316,PS5,3,520.16,522.08,1.92,1.0,They are going after another job.
36316,PS5,3,522.36,531.2,8.84,1.0,"So ask them about the other job and give competitive, give a competitive offer like match the offer."
36316,PS5,3,531.32,548.0,16.68,1.0,"So if they're leaving voluntarily and they have let's say a higher salary and they want to go there because it's more flexible, the the first company should say, OK, we will match that and we'll give you £50 per week more like."
36316,PS5,3,548.6,549.96,1.36,2.0,"So, so, So what?"
36316,PS5,3,549.96,561.12,11.16,1.0,"Should it be summary match the no offer a competitive salary benefit, etcetera as the?"
36316,PS5,3,563.2,564.04,0.84,2.0,Maybe it's quite.
36316,PS5,3,565.44,565.96,0.52,3.0,Similar like.
36316,PS5,3,566.08,567.08,1.0,2.0,Quite similar like to.
36316,PS5,3,568.8,569.04,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,569.04,579.28,10.24,1.0,So I'd say instead directly I'd say offer a competitive salary to the new job offer.
36316,PS5,3,580.84,581.6,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36316,PS5,3,581.6,581.96,0.36,3.0,I think it's.
36316,PS5,3,582.16,584.2,2.04,2.0,Competitive salary.
36316,PS5,3,586.56,587.2,0.64,1.0,To the new.
36316,PS5,3,588.12,590.72,2.6,2.0,To offer a competitive salary.
36316,PS5,3,590.96,591.64,0.68,3.0,Match to.
36316,PS5,3,592.24,592.72,0.48,1.0,The new.
36316,PS5,3,593.04,593.36,0.32,2.0,To.
36316,PS5,3,594.36,596.6,2.24,1.0,The new job company.
36316,PS5,3,596.72,598.64,1.92,2.0,New job New job Company No.
36316,PS5,3,598.68,599.48,0.8,1.0,"No, no, no."
36316,PS5,3,599.48,601.2,1.72,1.0,I'm just trying to come up with a.
36316,PS5,3,602.6,605.04,2.44,3.0,New or just a new?
36316,PS5,3,605.04,605.88,0.84,1.0,New post.
36316,PS5,3,606.08,609.96,3.88,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, but just make sure you delete."
36316,PS5,3,610.28,611.48,1.2,2.0,Them I delete the.
36316,PS5,3,613.2,614.76,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, because that's saying the same thing."
36316,PS5,3,615.44,619.72,4.28,1.0,I just type in financial benefits because now we have the 50.
36316,PS5,3,619.88,620.92,1.04,2.0,"Final, final."
36316,PS5,3,622.4,622.88,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, wait."
36316,PS5,3,622.92,626.48,3.56,2.0,By by Nan CIAL.
36316,PS5,3,626.6,626.8,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
36316,PS5,3,626.88,629.84,2.96,1.0,And after the the 1st and you don't need that I yeah.
36316,PS5,3,632.84,633.96,1.12,2.0,AI by.
36316,PS5,3,634.12,634.68,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, this."
36316,PS5,3,635.2,635.76,0.56,2.0,"One Nan, Sure."
36316,PS5,3,635.76,636.44,0.68,2.0,"OK, Yeah."
36316,PS5,3,641.92,642.44,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
36316,PS5,3,642.44,643.4,0.96,1.0,Do we have anything else?
36316,PS5,3,643.4,644.2,0.8,1.0,Do we want to submit it?
36316,PS5,3,644.2,647.08,2.88,1.0,"We have one minute, so like anything else."
36316,PS5,3,647.32,648.64,1.32,2.0,And so maybe we can just submit.
35493,PS6,3,17.31,22.31,5.0,1.0,Do you want to each like think about it for a few minutes and then just spitball?
35493,PS6,3,22.87,23.11,0.24,2.0,See what?
35493,PS6,3,23.11,23.91,0.8,1.0,We come up with.
35493,PS6,3,38.08,39.76,1.68,1.0,"We're allowed to use like paper, right?"
35493,PS6,3,42.04,42.96,0.92,2.0,I think we can use.
35493,PS6,3,43.6,55.2,11.6,1.0,That 10 should we actually oh your group was way better than mine dude nobody oh wait this is you can write on like anything I.
35493,PS6,3,56.12,57.0,0.88,3.0,Better go to the last.
35493,PS6,3,58.72,59.52,0.8,1.0,Time you guys wanna?
35493,PS6,3,63.16,63.4,0.24,2.0,Thanks.
35493,PS6,3,64.72,67.32,2.6,2.0,They want to like write a board.
35493,PS6,3,69.12,70.32,1.2,2.0,Just do everything more.
35493,PS6,3,70.56,70.68,0.12,3.0,Got.
35493,PS6,3,72.16,73.72,1.56,1.0,To do the mind and that thing.
35493,PS6,3,137.76,139.44,1.68,1.0,This is a very random one.
35493,PS6,3,146.04,160.4,14.36,3.0,"I'm sorry, can we think of, I don't know, cold showers and how those effects different people differently and that makes you want to, I don't know, say something like scream."
35493,PS6,3,160.4,164.08,3.68,3.0,But then I'm said you can use that for for singing in that kind of sense.
35493,PS6,3,167.64,179.0,11.36,2.0,We can actually like if if it seems on the water is going to get going unless you you won't get get any water for your shower.
35493,PS6,3,179.0,181.0,2.0,1.0,"Yeah, I thought I had the same idea."
35493,PS6,3,181.2,188.56,7.36,1.0,Like the thing that like software or whatever that turns the water off if you're not.
35493,PS6,3,189.24,189.72,0.48,1.0,But then.
35493,PS6,3,189.8,191.6,1.8,1.0,But then the issue is that that that will.
35493,PS6,3,191.64,192.36,0.72,2.0,Make people.
35493,PS6,3,192.48,194.48,2.0,1.0,That will make people go for 20 minutes.
35493,PS6,3,194.48,196.68,2.2,1.0,That'll just make people take short showers.
35493,PS6,3,197.12,197.88,0.76,2.0,You know that's true.
35493,PS6,3,198.16,200.84,2.68,1.0,So how do you how do you make them?
35493,PS6,3,205.16,207.44,2.28,3.0,"That's really bad on so many levels, except saying."
35493,PS6,3,211.68,224.36,12.68,1.0,"Could do like, you know how they're like those driving insurance apps like OK, you can get an app on your phone if you like drive well or whatever your car insurance is cheaper could have that."
35493,PS6,3,224.36,235.8,11.44,1.0,"But like in the shower, you can log it that you're singing in the shower to your insurance and you'll get reduced rates, you know, and then and then that addresses the 20 minute issue."
35493,PS6,3,235.8,237.6,1.8,1.0,And that's like an economic incentive.
35493,PS6,3,238.0,241.44,3.44,3.0,"Yeah, oh, once your boss left 20 minute mark, the water bill goes down."
35493,PS6,3,242.4,246.72,4.32,1.0,"Or well, no, it's just if you sing in the shower for 20 minutes, it's good for your health."
35493,PS6,3,246.96,252.76,5.8,1.0,So the insurance companies are incentivized to incentivize you to do that.
35493,PS6,3,252.76,253.12,0.36,1.0,That would be.
35493,PS6,3,253.24,254.0,0.76,2.0,"Good, yeah."
35493,PS6,3,254.44,264.59,10.15,3.0,Let's go with that.
35493,PS6,3,265.03,269.96,4.93,1.0,"The 20 minutes piece, yeah, I mean, I think that's given another, yeah."
35493,PS6,3,270.08,276.04,5.96,1.0,See if we can come up with something more crazy because that's like that's just a little tweak on on an existing thing.
35493,PS6,3,276.96,280.72,3.76,1.0,"But I think the 20 minutes part is the hardest, yeah."
35493,PS6,3,281.8,284.16,2.36,2.0,Thing because.
35493,PS6,3,284.64,287.68,3.04,3.0,It's ingrained in my mind that we have to take like shorter showers.
35493,PS6,3,289.6,304.96,15.36,1.0,"Yeah, it's like the only really thing I think I can, I feel like it kind of has to be an economic incentive or some some sort of like propaganda type thing like public ad campaign or whatever."
35493,PS6,3,304.96,312.08,7.12,1.0,"But I feel like that's also not very creative to like, I don't know, make Tik Tokers do it or whatever."
35493,PS6,3,313.36,318.64,5.28,3.0,Can that give you like exclusive access to someone's like you saws or whatever that's.
35493,PS6,3,321.2,321.44,0.24,1.0,Another.
35493,PS6,3,323.28,328.08,4.8,3.0,"If you like keep singing their specific songs, you might get like exclusive access to."
35493,PS6,3,333.12,344.72,11.6,1.0,"Wonder if there are any like, like similar things that have happened in the past now, like, I don't know, like exercise."
35493,PS6,3,344.72,348.96,4.24,1.0,"They're like, OK, you should exercise 30 minutes four times a week."
35493,PS6,3,349.56,355.76,6.2,1.0,But I also don't know that people are very incentivized to do that in general.
35493,PS6,3,356.4,362.04,5.64,1.0,And I don't think that's been done in many creative ways.
35493,PS6,3,362.36,366.6,4.24,1.0,"I don't know, we can go with the insurance thing."
35493,PS6,3,366.6,387.04,20.44,1.0,"If you guys like that feel like how can, how can we change the smart shower in order to get it to the 20 minute point?"
35493,PS6,3,387.04,392.64,5.6,1.0,Because I feel like that there's something to be said for like the immediate kind of like.
35493,PS6,3,393.64,394.0,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35493,PS6,3,403.09,404.97,1.88,1.0,"OK, wait, what if, What if?"
35493,PS6,3,408.69,410.89,2.2,1.0,"So you got a game of fire somehow, right?"
35493,PS6,3,411.53,419.08,7.55,1.0,"So let's say we get everybody a smart shower and then like, you have like, your friends on the smart shower or whatever."
35493,PS6,3,419.48,428.0,8.52,1.0,"And I don't know if it's like karaoke or like exactly how it works, but somehow singing in the shower gets you points."
35493,PS6,3,428.24,430.88,2.64,1.0,"Maybe you can like, cure your friends sing or whatever."
35493,PS6,3,430.88,432.6,1.72,1.0,"And like, it becomes like a social thing."
35493,PS6,3,432.6,432.76,0.16,1.0,Oh yeah.
35493,PS6,3,432.76,435.56,2.8,1.0,It's more of AI.
35493,PS6,3,435.64,441.72,6.08,1.0,"Don't know, like game of fight, Game of fight somehow, Yeah."
35493,PS6,3,444.32,448.76,4.44,2.0,"I think this is a creative one, but I'm still thinking about whether I wanted to do that during my."
35493,PS6,3,448.76,449.52,0.76,1.0,Showers.
35493,PS6,3,449.6,450.52,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35493,PS6,3,453.12,456.44,3.32,2.0,"Because I'm always naked and talk to people, yeah."
35493,PS6,3,459.8,460.12,0.32,1.0,I wonder.
35493,PS6,3,460.12,461.48,1.36,2.0,What whether it's a good one?
35493,PS6,3,463.4,463.6,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35493,PS6,3,464.88,465.64,0.76,3.0,Should we start writing?
35493,PS6,3,467.04,468.88,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, sure, we can try something."
35493,PS6,3,470.24,482.16,11.92,1.0,So do you want to do that or you think insurance or the game maybe?
35493,PS6,3,483.08,483.76,0.68,2.0,We can integrate.
35493,PS6,3,484.44,485.16,0.72,1.0,"It yeah, OK."
35493,PS6,3,488.84,497.28,8.44,1.0,"Or maybe you can OK, so you can do the game but also submit that like link that to your insurance so you also get a discount."
35493,PS6,3,497.68,499.44,1.76,1.0,"OK, so it's like a double incentive."
35493,PS6,3,500.96,501.24,0.28,1.0,OK.
35493,PS6,3,501.28,508.32,7.04,1.0,"So it's like, is it an app or like smart shower thing?"
35493,PS6,3,509.08,511.24,2.16,2.0,"Yeah, maybe the insurance company can provide that."
35493,PS6,3,511.92,512.84,0.92,1.0,"OK, Yeah."
35493,PS6,3,513.52,514.72,1.2,3.0,I go with the physical product key.
35493,PS6,3,514.92,552.6,37.68,1.0,"OK, so we propose a smart shower that can one keep track of how often you sing in the shower and to kind of like gamify the experience by offering karaoke, leaderboards and other social motivation."
35493,PS6,3,553.12,559.28,6.16,1.0,The incentive is twofold.
35493,PS6,3,561.72,574.8,13.08,1.0,"1st, the gaming experience encourages you to sing in the shower as much as possible."
35493,PS6,3,575.8,594.64,18.84,1.0,"Second, the data on how often you sing is provided with consent to your insurance company, who can then offer discounts on health insurance."
35493,PS6,3,595.68,596.6,0.92,1.0,"OK, how's that?"
36144,PS4,3,1.4,8.48,7.08,1.0,"Educational inequalities, the unequal distribution of OK, that's."
36144,PS4,3,8.72,9.12,0.4,2.0,This is.
36144,PS4,3,9.44,10.28,0.84,1.0,"So yeah, wow."
36144,PS4,3,10.64,11.76,1.12,2.0,"Difficult, OK."
36144,PS4,3,13.48,15.04,1.56,1.0,Solving big world problems.
36144,PS4,3,15.36,15.96,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36144,PS4,3,28.44,30.36,1.92,1.0,Universalization of education.
36144,PS4,3,31.64,40.68,9.04,1.0,"I mean, it's not an unheard of idea, so I'm not sure how creative it is to to overcome inequality in education."
36144,PS4,3,40.88,44.72,3.84,1.0,"Oh my God, this is first of all problems."
36144,PS4,3,47.0,49.24,2.24,3.0,Unequal distribution of academic resources.
36144,PS4,3,49.24,55.36,6.12,3.0,"So I, I don't know the first thing that came in my heart, my mind is like drones everywhere, like dropping."
36144,PS4,3,57.4,59.0,1.6,2.0,But it's creative at least though.
36144,PS4,3,60.72,77.24,16.52,3.0,"But yeah, and drones aren't going to fly that far all over the world though, because they especially say unequal distribution of academic resources."
36144,PS4,3,77.24,81.24,4.0,3.0,So we somehow need to get the materials to people.
36144,PS4,3,81.76,82.0,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,83.0,87.76,4.76,2.0,"But I think if you also give materials like books, you don't change anything."
36144,PS4,3,87.76,89.08,1.32,3.0,"Because if they cannot read, then how?"
36144,PS4,3,89.08,89.96,0.88,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36144,PS4,3,90.2,90.32,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,90.32,103.2,12.88,2.0,"So I think the only thing that could really incentivize is like one person, like something that is like a person, not a book or not a line course, for instance, like only person, like personal teachers."
36144,PS4,3,105.04,117.44,12.4,2.0,So like something where everyone has a sort of personal mentor older that can educate him.
36144,PS4,3,117.64,119.2,1.56,3.0,Could it be online?
36144,PS4,3,119.2,128.24,9.04,3.0,"Because like, if we can get, if we can get them to have access to electricity and the Internet, then then we don't need people to be going everywhere."
36144,PS4,3,128.76,130.28,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, but yeah."
36144,PS4,3,131.4,136.24,4.84,2.0,"But I think like they, they don't have access to Internet, like, you know, yeah."
36144,PS4,3,137.6,139.08,1.48,3.0,So then the the 1st that.
36144,PS4,3,139.08,139.52,0.44,1.0,Wasn't to.
36144,PS4,3,139.68,139.92,0.24,3.0,Me.
36144,PS4,3,141.12,146.16,5.04,2.0,"Or like Robo Oh, instead of people robo."
36144,PS4,3,146.52,146.88,0.36,1.0,Like.
36144,PS4,3,149.64,151.28,1.64,3.0,You are doing it all wrong.
36144,PS4,3,152.12,154.48,2.36,2.0,"But if you don't have it easy, probably you don't have robo."
36144,PS4,3,156.16,158.04,1.88,3.0,"No, yeah."
36144,PS4,3,158.04,158.68,0.64,3.0,Oh my God.
36144,PS4,3,164.88,182.64,17.76,2.0,"But yeah, what if you could create the source of like in every country, these mentors like every, every young people as a as a mentor that is educated and it is paid again by not by the government probably, but by like United Nation, all this stuff."
36144,PS4,3,184.04,184.68,0.64,3.0,But that's the thing.
36144,PS4,3,184.68,190.04,5.36,3.0,"Like, we don't know, first of all, how many people there are around the world who, who needs the education?"
36144,PS4,3,190.04,195.8,5.76,3.0,"And secondly, how many people can we get to like help out with this kind of thing, right?"
36144,PS4,3,197.04,198.28,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36144,PS4,3,198.28,198.6,0.32,2.0,But.
36144,PS4,3,199.56,204.36,4.8,3.0,"Like, because it's all over the world, I think they're talking about like, yeah."
36144,PS4,3,204.84,208.6,3.76,2.0,I think there are more educated people that not educated people probably.
36144,PS4,3,209.44,213.84,4.4,3.0,"Well, no, like certain regions of the world, I'm pretty sure like like what do you say?"
36144,PS4,3,213.84,217.2,3.36,3.0,Like maybe some don't have access to like Internet or like.
36144,PS4,3,217.32,217.72,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,217.92,219.08,1.16,3.0,Electricity even.
36144,PS4,3,219.2,222.72,3.52,3.0,"So yeah, Oh my gosh."
36144,PS4,3,226.52,233.08,6.56,1.0,"I think it must be more simple, like we can't obviously solve it with like one big idea."
36144,PS4,3,234.08,236.2,2.12,1.0,"It's more staggered, more strategic."
36144,PS4,3,236.4,239.2,2.8,3.0,"Yeah, like I feel like it's not just one idea."
36144,PS4,3,239.2,241.04,1.84,3.0,I feel like there's so many intricate layers.
36144,PS4,3,241.16,241.96,0.8,1.0,Exactly.
36144,PS4,3,241.96,245.48,3.52,1.0,"That's like, you know, not everyone is gaining just primary education."
36144,PS4,3,245.48,249.08,3.6,1.0,Some people are like full grown adults gaining secondary education.
36144,PS4,3,259.04,269.24,10.2,1.0,"Access to resources are the biggest problem, but I think like not just in terms of books but also like quality teachers being available everywhere."
36144,PS4,3,269.28,282.2,12.92,1.0,"Like most like just take considering Oxbridge, so many people are concentrated here, so much so that in the UK if you go to other universities, there's like 1-2 professors per department who are like well known and everyone else is not really well known."
36144,PS4,3,282.24,290.96,8.72,1.0,So I'm like so in academic resources they might lack the same kinds of software access that we have access to etc etc.
36144,PS4,3,290.96,299.0,8.04,1.0,So I'm thinking like I guess breaking copyrighted?
36144,PS4,3,299.32,299.76,0.44,3.0,I guess.
36144,PS4,3,300.16,303.04,2.88,1.0,"Materials that like, you know."
36144,PS4,3,305.68,306.76,1.08,3.0,Like paper.
36144,PS4,3,306.76,315.56,8.8,1.0,"Like, yeah, basically gatekeepers of knowledge of all kinds basically."
36144,PS4,3,315.88,326.2,10.32,1.0,"And also improvising incentive structure for like teachers, professors to go anywhere they want to instead of like being concentrated in very specific places."
36144,PS4,3,326.68,333.56,6.88,3.0,"Maybe like in the contract now instead of like, you know, you're stuck here for like, don't know, two years or three years."
36144,PS4,3,333.88,334.8,0.92,3.0,You are forced.
36144,PS4,3,334.88,347.92,13.04,3.0,"Well, well the force is not the right word, but like incentivize not incentivize but maybe like 3 months out to do like teaching in and like less developed."
36144,PS4,3,348.24,348.76,0.52,2.0,Region.
36144,PS4,3,349.4,354.04,4.64,3.0,"So like, make that compulsory for all, like professors."
36144,PS4,3,354.04,354.56,0.52,2.0,Or teachers.
36144,PS4,3,354.56,355.2,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, I think it's good."
36144,PS4,3,356.44,360.88,4.44,2.0,But I I'm also thinking about like really less developed country.
36144,PS4,3,360.88,364.12,3.24,2.0,I think a lot of people cannot study because they need to work.
36144,PS4,3,364.44,364.84,0.4,1.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,365.04,370.0,4.96,2.0,So maybe also like paying people for studying could be a sort of.
36144,PS4,3,370.48,381.44,10.96,1.0,"OK, so in my country, one of the ways in which we actually dealt with like people, you know, children especially won't go to work is to introduce midday meals, like meals at school."
36144,PS4,3,381.48,381.92,0.44,2.0,So.
36144,PS4,3,382.24,394.64,12.4,1.0,"They worked so that they can, you know, subsist like they can have food for the lunch and dinner, but if they instead came to school and actually got lunch and dinner, then then they didn't have to work that day."
36144,PS4,3,394.8,407.8,13.0,1.0,"So it kind of incentivized that thing in in a way that most parents decided, OK, let them go to school because whatever they get through work there anyway getting through school and are also getting educated in the process."
36144,PS4,3,407.8,408.2,0.4,1.0,So.
36144,PS4,3,408.44,408.8,0.36,3.0,So when?
36144,PS4,3,409.16,409.32,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,409.92,410.96,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, I'm perfect."
36144,PS4,3,411.28,413.6,2.32,1.0,But what do we write that's just so many kids?
36144,PS4,3,413.88,414.64,0.76,3.0,So many ideas.
36144,PS4,3,416.92,417.04,0.12,2.0,OK.
36144,PS4,3,418.32,422.32,4.0,3.0,"Because yeah, 1 aspect is like the incentivizing of the."
36144,PS4,3,422.84,425.96,3.12,1.0,The persons who are teaching correct itself and also what?
36144,PS4,3,425.96,428.16,2.2,2.0,We can put both of them I think.
36144,PS4,3,428.64,428.96,0.32,3.0,OK.
36144,PS4,3,429.92,431.04,1.12,2.0,Or do you think only one?
36144,PS4,3,432.36,434.64,2.28,3.0,"That means OK, but then we can."
36144,PS4,3,434.8,438.08,3.28,1.0,Honestly have big one creator as reform of education system.
36144,PS4,3,440.56,440.76,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,440.76,442.08,1.32,3.0,And then there's like.
36144,PS4,3,442.56,443.04,0.48,1.0,Bots and.
36144,PS4,3,444.28,446.88,2.6,3.0,"Then we have very, very like intricate details."
36144,PS4,3,447.12,448.6,1.48,1.0,"So, Oh my God, I keep doing."
36144,PS4,3,449.84,465.04,15.2,1.0,The education system in the world is mired with problems that will not be resolved by one idea.
36144,PS4,3,465.76,484.04,18.28,1.0,"But we could introduce several mechanisms, such as, I guess, Open Access to materials and the."
36144,PS4,3,484.52,486.28,1.76,3.0,Reforming the teaching no.
36144,PS4,3,486.32,487.28,0.96,3.0,The contract no.
36144,PS4,3,487.32,501.4,14.08,1.0,"The yeah, reforming the teaching professorship system in academia, including compensation provided to them."
36144,PS4,3,507.76,517.64,9.88,1.0,I'm going to put next sentence this may all this may also include I'm typing so fast because the time is going.
36144,PS4,3,517.96,526.72,8.76,1.0,This may also include a a requirement to teach in specific and underperveled let's.
36144,PS4,3,527.36,527.48,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,528.32,530.72,2.4,2.0,"Yeah, let's do it in the previous."
36144,PS4,3,531.04,533.84,2.8,1.0,"College areas, yeah, or countries."
36144,PS4,3,534.08,534.24,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,536.84,541.92,5.08,1.0,For specified duration OK then the next one is like like the.
36144,PS4,3,543.0,543.28,0.28,3.0,We.
36144,PS4,3,543.48,548.72,5.24,1.0,Can also consider introducing.
36144,PS4,3,550.32,552.04,1.72,2.0,"Yeah, it's a gain incentives, I think."
36144,PS4,3,552.04,554.04,2.0,1.0,Incentives such as meal.
36144,PS4,3,554.04,556.12,2.08,3.0,"Schemes, meal schemes and."
36144,PS4,3,556.6,558.28,1.68,2.0,I think also like money compensation.
36144,PS4,3,558.28,559.64,1.36,1.0,Primary Education.
36144,PS4,3,561.6,566.24,4.64,3.0,But then only primary could you say for for?
36144,PS4,3,567.04,569.84,2.8,1.0,Meal schemes for those who attend school.
36144,PS4,3,570.4,572.28,1.88,3.0,"OK, yeah, I cannot afford or."
36144,PS4,3,572.96,573.28,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,576.48,582.72,6.24,3.0,"And yeah, like what you said, like compensation, like, like because if they don't work, then where do they get the money from?"
36144,PS4,3,582.72,582.92,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36144,PS4,3,582.92,583.36,0.44,2.0,Exactly.
36144,PS4,3,583.4,584.68,1.28,3.0,Like being paid to study.
36144,PS4,3,584.72,587.92,3.2,3.0,I don't know what the correct term would be like.
36144,PS4,3,589.28,591.2,1.92,2.0,Monetary compensation maybe.
36144,PS4,3,596.48,600.12,3.64,1.0,Attend school leaving opportunities to.
36144,PS4,3,600.32,601.24,0.92,3.0,"Work, work."

34428,PS3,3,550.28,555.76,5.48,2.0,Like like have an advertising campaign to use a different word.
34428,PS3,3,557.0,562.28,5.28,1.0,"Or and come up with that different word, like apologise, like if you give them the solution."
34428,PS3,3,562.28,562.68,0.4,1.0,Oh yeah.
34428,PS3,3,594.95,599.19,4.24,3.0,"We have some special microphone, they can change the story, pronounce."

34428,PS3,3,620.42,621.3,0.88,2.0,"OK, Next one."
34428,PS3,3,625.94,626.62,0.68,2.0,"Oh, OK."
34213,PS2,3,31.44,36.96,5.52,1.0,Control cost and inefficient delivery schedules.
34213,PS2,3,36.96,39.4,2.44,1.0,Please come up with one created at the other.
34213,PS2,3,39.4,45.8,6.4,1.0,Technical supply chain security operations management.
34213,PS2,3,47.48,53.4,5.92,2.0,And control cost and inefficient Oh.
34213,PS2,3,53.68,57.4,3.72,3.0,One creative idea to technical supply chain security.
34213,PS2,3,58.36,69.88,11.52,1.0,"Maybe maybe the having a centralized warehouse facility that was one, right."
34213,PS2,3,69.88,86.32,16.44,1.0,"So if this probably that company that has different small warehouses in in different cities, maybe consolidating in one will reduce first it will reduce costs and delivery schedules."
34213,PS2,3,86.32,88.84,2.52,1.0,"In terms of the delivery schedule, I'm not sure."
34213,PS2,3,89.48,91.36,1.88,2.0,But this is something that is creative enough.
34213,PS2,3,91.36,94.52,3.16,2.0,"I mean like, I don't know to what extent we need to put the creative thinking."
34213,PS2,3,94.56,94.88,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
34213,PS2,3,95.4,96.08,0.68,2.0,Listen to our side.
34213,PS2,3,96.12,101.0,4.88,2.0,"It's definitely a good idea, but let's think about something that is."
34213,PS2,3,101.44,101.92,0.48,3.0,Crazy more.
34213,PS2,3,102.68,103.0,0.32,1.0,Creative.
34213,PS2,3,103.44,130.08,26.64,2.0,"Like, I know, how about sending the package via drones like inefficient discussion because maybe the city was because the city has a lot of cognition or because the road is not so good and therefore reducing the reducing the speed for daily free or maybe or whatever it is one thing creative thing."
34213,PS2,3,130.08,130.44,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34213,PS2,3,130.44,131.2,0.76,2.0,So what do you think?
34213,PS2,3,131.36,132.36,1.0,2.0,Maybe something else?
34213,PS2,3,133.28,134.08,0.8,3.0,Other things.
34213,PS2,3,134.08,134.96,0.88,1.0,That could work.
34213,PS2,3,135.32,141.12,5.8,1.0,It's we could have like automated robots doing some of these tasks.
34213,PS2,3,141.4,141.88,0.48,2.0,"Oh, yeah."
34213,PS2,3,141.96,149.6,7.64,2.0,"I mean, I remember in, I remember in China, there are some robotic delivery robots there."
34213,PS2,3,150.08,150.32,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34213,PS2,3,150.32,155.52,5.2,1.0,"So, so they have this small, a small cap, but it is fully automated."
34213,PS2,3,155.52,159.64,4.12,1.0,So they can just put the stuff on them and they will just drive by themselves.
34213,PS2,3,160.28,162.52,2.24,1.0,"So like automated, automated robots?"
34213,PS2,3,162.52,163.56,1.04,2.0,"Automated robots, yeah."
34213,PS2,3,163.92,175.8,11.88,1.0,"You know to doing the supply, the supply part probably maybe also like, I don't know the delivery, but you know, making the packages to to sorting, sorting them out quicker, quickly."
34213,PS2,3,177.12,179.24,2.12,2.0,"So within the warehouse itself, right?"
34213,PS2,3,179.24,180.48,1.24,1.0,"Could be, yeah, that could be a."
34213,PS2,3,180.48,180.8,0.32,2.0,Way of.
34213,PS2,3,181.16,185.32,4.16,1.0,"You know, reducing time and and also it's a robot, right?"
34213,PS2,3,185.32,187.2,1.88,1.0,It's not a person that you have to pay a salary.
34213,PS2,3,187.64,187.8,0.16,3.0,Right.
34213,PS2,3,188.08,191.6,3.52,3.0,"But the the main concern of this question is about security, right?"
34213,PS2,3,191.76,194.48,2.72,3.0,Please come up with one creative a day to check and support change security.
34213,PS2,3,194.56,195.88,1.32,2.0,Should I change security?
34213,PS2,3,195.88,197.48,1.6,3.0,What does it mean by security?
34213,PS2,3,197.64,200.16,2.52,2.0,Security means maybe about the.
34213,PS2,3,200.48,202.32,1.84,2.0,So the first question is about the cost.
34213,PS2,3,202.48,202.8,0.32,2.0,"Yeah, I."
34213,PS2,3,202.88,204.24,1.36,1.0,Think the security they mean.
34213,PS2,3,204.72,209.48,4.76,3.0,"Yeah, it's come up from the vulnerability within the supply chain could lead to."
34213,PS2,3,209.48,212.04,2.56,2.0,"Oh, the vulnerability this itself, right the."
34213,PS2,3,212.28,216.48,4.2,3.0,Vulnerability that caused the cost and efficiency.
34213,PS2,3,216.48,218.68,2.2,3.0,"So it's, yeah, it's about how to make."
34213,PS2,3,219.08,220.12,1.04,2.0,"Super chain, Yeah, yeah."
34213,PS2,3,220.24,221.68,1.44,2.0,"So what kind of, So what is one thing?"
34213,PS2,3,221.72,222.28,0.56,2.0,So what kind?
34213,PS2,3,222.52,227.64,5.12,2.0,So maybe what kind of what kind of vulnerability that can lead to the situation?
34213,PS2,3,228.28,228.6,0.32,1.0,Of some.
34213,PS2,3,228.6,229.08,0.48,3.0,Control scale.
34213,PS2,3,229.6,230.56,0.96,2.0,So for example.
34213,PS2,3,235.6,236.36,0.76,1.0,Maybe.
34213,PS2,3,237.68,241.84,4.16,2.0,"Supply Supply chain supplier, maybe supplier instability?"
34213,PS2,3,241.84,249.04,7.2,1.0,"That's one because let's say that the supplier doesn't have the, their delivery doesn't arrive on time to make the."
34213,PS2,3,249.44,252.56,3.12,1.0,I mean the raw material doesn't arrive in time to make the main product.
34213,PS2,3,252.72,257.44,4.72,2.0,Be on time or suddenly cancel because very reason right?
34213,PS2,3,258.04,264.44,6.4,1.0,"Maybe in that sense to control that one, you could have like it's an app, right?"
34213,PS2,3,264.44,276.72,12.28,1.0,Like an app or you have or or a marketplace in an app that you have all the different suppliers from all the different regions and that way you can kind of hedge against it's not working.
34213,PS2,3,276.72,279.0,2.28,1.0,You have another one that you can just request from an app.
34213,PS2,3,279.52,280.68,1.16,2.0,"OK, bring you the."
34213,PS2,3,280.8,282.8,2.0,1.0,"Raw material, That could be one way."
34213,PS2,3,285.36,285.64,0.28,2.0,OK.
34213,PS2,3,285.64,289.32,3.68,2.0,So it's like hedging by having alternative supplier.
34213,PS2,3,289.6,291.76,2.16,2.0,So maybe some sort of Apple or platform.
34213,PS2,3,293.04,293.68,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, that's one."
34213,PS2,3,293.92,299.44,5.52,2.0,"OK, that's one hygiene I'm."
34213,PS2,3,302.4,313.72,11.32,3.0,"Thinking about what what the research researchers that think about the security, whether it's like just simple thing about somebody hijack your supply during."
34213,PS2,3,313.8,316.84,3.04,2.0,"No, I think security means more about the general state."
34213,PS2,3,316.92,317.08,0.16,1.0,Of the.
34213,PS2,3,317.68,318.32,0.64,2.0,Supply chain.
34213,PS2,3,318.4,323.68,5.28,1.0,"Not like someone is stealing their things, but I don't know like not making it on time because."
34213,PS2,3,324.32,324.56,0.24,2.0,Like.
34213,PS2,3,324.6,329.6,5.0,1.0,"Or something, or maybe I don't know 11 machine that damage to."
34213,PS2,3,330.04,330.32,0.28,2.0,Fix.
34213,PS2,3,330.32,332.36,2.04,1.0,It so there's a control cost maybe?
34213,PS2,3,333.0,336.36,3.36,2.0,"So higher cost can be can make the suppression less secure, right?"
34213,PS2,3,336.56,339.88,3.32,1.0,"And that's another thing we could, we could, we could do, right."
34213,PS2,3,339.88,356.04,16.16,1.0,"We could like install some kinds of chips or or something to the machines so that we have, we have the information of the machine is doing before it damages or before it needs an unplanned maintenance."
34213,PS2,3,356.04,356.28,0.24,1.0,Right.
34213,PS2,3,357.04,357.76,0.72,1.0,"Kind of, I see."
34213,PS2,3,359.92,369.0,9.08,1.0,"Yeah, it's kind of know that in advance so that it doesn't cut us by surprise and we don't."
34213,PS2,3,369.0,374.08,5.08,2.0,"Have so it's like, it's like, so it's like a preparatory mitigation."
34213,PS2,3,374.32,375.52,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, like a preemptive."
34213,PS2,3,375.8,377.52,1.72,2.0,Preemptive preemptive measure.
34213,PS2,3,378.0,383.68,5.68,1.0,"Preemptive measure, Yeah, like in selling chips to the machines to give concept."
34213,PS2,3,383.76,385.0,1.24,2.0,"Yeah, I like that idea actually."
34213,PS2,3,385.0,389.4,4.4,2.0,"I mean, like, yeah, yeah, yeah."
34213,PS2,3,390.04,390.52,0.48,3.0,So the idea is.
34213,PS2,3,390.52,391.6,1.08,1.0,Let's write it to.
34213,PS2,3,391.92,398.6,6.68,3.0,"More to have redundant system, I mean that's mean that have more."
34213,PS2,3,398.88,402.88,4.0,3.0,For example we have two supplier for same goods.
34213,PS2,3,402.88,406.68,3.8,3.0,So if one of the suppliers like can't deliver.
34213,PS2,3,406.68,410.88,4.2,1.0,Then we can like an app with alternative suppliers in case one of them.
34213,PS2,3,411.24,411.88,0.64,2.0,Has a problem.
34213,PS2,3,411.88,413.72,1.84,2.0,We should we should only choose one too.
34213,PS2,3,414.2,415.2,1.0,2.0,"I think it, I think it."
34213,PS2,3,415.2,433.24,18.04,2.0,"Yeah, it's come up with one I think to be heard around us if we are saying about a vulnerability that could lead to uncontrolled cost and inefficient delivery, a platform that can hatch a multiple supplier to put against delivery to ensure the supply chain will be better."
34213,PS2,3,434.32,442.4,8.08,2.0,But the pre emptive maintenance will it lead to related to the the delivery schedule.
34213,PS2,3,442.4,445.72,3.32,2.0,"I mean like, oh, OK, got it."
34213,PS2,3,450.12,450.88,0.76,3.0,5 more minutes.
34213,PS2,3,451.2,451.6,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34213,PS2,3,452.36,453.08,0.72,1.0,Just put that one.
34213,PS2,3,454.04,457.28,3.24,2.0,Preemptive maintenance of.
34213,PS2,3,457.96,459.08,1.12,1.0,Offered by.
34213,PS2,3,460.92,461.8,0.88,3.0,Digital Twin.
34213,PS2,3,462.64,463.12,0.48,2.0,Shut up.
34213,PS2,3,464.04,466.68,2.64,2.0,I'm not saying that preemptive maintenance.
34213,PS2,3,467.8,471.92,4.12,2.0,So are we putting the supply chain one or are we putting the preemptive maintenance for?
34213,PS2,3,471.92,477.84,5.92,1.0,The preemptive maintenance to safeguard the supply chains in case any machine gets damaged.
34213,PS2,3,479.56,481.32,1.76,2.0,To minimize.
34213,PS2,3,481.88,483.28,1.4,1.0,AI enable chips.
34213,PS2,3,484.48,486.56,2.08,2.0,Preemptive preemptive maintenance.
34213,PS2,3,487.72,488.84,1.12,3.0,Plan breakdown.
34213,PS2,3,489.16,518.8,29.64,2.0,"And plan warehouse operational breakdown should you breakdown through monitoring chips, monitoring chip through monitoring through implementing, implementing monitoring chips, installing in where in warehouses?"
34213,PS2,3,522.12,523.76,1.64,1.0,In all the machines in the warehouse.
34213,PS2,3,524.64,526.48,1.84,2.0,In in warehouse.
34213,PS2,3,527.88,528.44,0.56,1.0,Machines.
34213,PS2,3,530.32,531.08,0.76,2.0,Machineries.
34213,PS2,3,532.64,534.4,1.76,2.0,And what else do you think?
34213,PS2,3,535.76,539.08,3.32,2.0,"So the maintenance can be done through installing chips, right?"
34213,PS2,3,540.04,548.08,8.04,1.0,"Yeah, the the, the chip will give like a report on on the state of the machine letting you know maybe this one will need maintenance next week."
34213,PS2,3,548.32,555.6,7.28,1.0,So you can just do it once the factory shuts down so that you don't stop the the supply chain.
34213,PS2,3,555.88,560.88,5.0,3.0,So you have a more robust production or operation schedule.
34213,PS2,3,561.0,561.72,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
34213,PS2,3,561.84,562.16,0.32,1.0,Exactly.
34213,PS2,3,563.28,568.16,4.88,2.0,"See, whatever I just try to put it, it's basically fixed on chips."
34213,PS2,3,573.44,573.64,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
34213,PS2,3,574.44,574.76,0.32,2.0,OK.
34213,PS2,3,578.6,579.08,0.48,1.0,Imagine.
34213,PS2,3,580.12,581.2,1.08,3.0,How many times do we have?
34213,PS2,3,584.0,585.16,1.16,3.0,How many times do we have to do?
34213,PS2,3,585.68,586.0,0.32,1.0,I think there.
35126,PS6,3,0.72,0.92,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35126,PS6,3,18.88,19.88,1.0,2.0,One creative idea.
35126,PS6,3,19.88,23.44,3.56,2.0,"OK, OK."
35126,PS6,3,26.92,29.0,2.08,1.0,Maybe there's like plenty of Youtubes.
35126,PS6,3,29.44,29.92,0.48,2.0,We need to do like.
35126,PS6,3,30.0,32.04,2.04,1.0,Home exercise and then showing.
35126,PS6,3,32.04,38.84,6.8,2.0,"Them yeah, I mean you're probably paying them is not very creative it's."
35126,PS6,3,40.52,41.16,0.64,1.0,Very encouraging.
35126,PS6,3,41.96,43.16,1.2,2.0,It's very encouraging.
35126,PS6,3,45.68,49.76,4.08,2.0,"I mean, it's probably the most encouraging trying to think."
35126,PS6,3,50.12,54.0,3.88,1.0,Or people are having hard time to cleaning up the bathroom so.
35126,PS6,3,54.0,54.12,0.12,2.0,It's.
35126,PS6,3,54.52,58.84,4.32,1.0,"Some kind of like YouTube showing, cleaning, exercising, dancing all together."
35126,PS6,3,58.84,61.76,2.92,3.0,"These videos are actually very popular, yeah."
35126,PS6,3,62.04,67.72,5.68,3.0,Like you just watch some I know that actually like somebody's cleaning and it's very aesthetic and it really.
35126,PS6,3,69.44,69.76,0.32,1.0,Calms you.
35126,PS6,3,69.84,69.96,0.12,3.0,Down.
35126,PS6,3,71.28,73.08,1.8,2.0,"That's actually, that's actually a good idea, yeah."
35126,PS6,3,74.64,80.04,5.4,2.0,To produce a series of videos just random people singing and cleaning in the shower on YouTube?
35126,PS6,3,80.2,80.36,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35126,PS6,3,81.76,82.56,0.8,2.0,Should we go with that?
35126,PS6,3,83.28,83.48,0.2,1.0,Yes.
35126,PS6,3,83.96,85.0,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, it's pretty creative."
35126,PS6,3,85.52,86.2,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, I think that's good."
35126,PS6,3,87.0,92.76,5.76,2.0,"Should we like, stick it in a make it like a competition or something, I don't know, like make it a trend on TikTok?"
35126,PS6,3,94.2,100.88,6.68,3.0,"Yeah, maybe like if it becomes a trend, then a lot of people."
35126,PS6,3,101.4,101.52,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35126,PS6,3,101.52,105.68,4.16,1.0,Is there any cleaning song?
35126,PS6,3,105.68,105.88,0.2,1.0,It can.
35126,PS6,3,107.68,108.0,0.32,3.0,Be any song.
35126,PS6,3,119.12,121.0,1.88,1.0,"20 minutes, actually long time."
35126,PS6,3,125.84,132.2,6.36,2.0,"Yeah, should we say stick it, try to turn it into some TikTok trend?"
35126,PS6,3,146.4,152.8,6.4,1.0,For 20 minutes you can do like some kind of small hand laundry or dye or hay or whatever.
35126,PS6,3,153.72,163.52,9.8,2.0,"Yeah, you could also put like a PlayStation or something in the shower or a karaoke machine in the shower."
35126,PS6,3,163.52,163.8,0.28,2.0,I actually.
35126,PS6,3,164.48,168.68,4.2,3.0,Bought a karaoke machine but I thought that would be expensive.
35126,PS6,3,168.68,168.8,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35126,PS6,3,168.8,170.32,1.52,3.0,Like how to encourage people?
35126,PS6,3,171.48,171.96,0.48,2.0,"To do that, should we?"
35126,PS6,3,171.96,172.92,0.96,2.0,Should we go with this 1 then?
35126,PS6,3,176.52,177.48,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, I think it's good."
35126,PS6,3,179.16,179.32,0.16,2.0,Enough.
35126,PS6,3,179.32,179.44,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35126,PS6,3,180.0,180.84,0.84,2.0,"I mean, it's pretty creative."
35126,PS6,3,180.84,182.64,1.8,2.0,It's sort of very it's out of the ordinary.
34382,PS3,3,0.0,961.68,2.28,2.0,This is this is very abstract.
34382,PS3,3,961.68,961.96,0.28,2.0,Nice.
34382,PS3,3,967.72,971.2,3.48,1.0,"If we can't reduce it, just increase the speed."
34382,PS3,3,982.2,985.92,3.72,1.0,"Lock the women in a room, because women are usually the one who say sorry."
34382,PS3,3,988.68,990.08,1.4,3.0,In UK everyone says.
34382,PS3,3,990.24,990.88,0.64,1.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,991.28,994.2,2.92,2.0,So that's like everyone says it.
34382,PS3,3,996.2,1001.72,5.52,3.0,"I think first of all, the most vulnerable countries are where this thing is in their part of culture."
34382,PS3,3,1001.72,1001.84,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,1002.32,1005.12,2.8,3.0,"So we'll need to kind of address them, yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1006.2,1009.16,2.96,2.0,So what we can do is we can.
34382,PS3,3,1009.52,1017.32,7.8,3.0,But how will we spread the awareness when we say that you don't have to use this word we are saying?
34382,PS3,3,1017.36,1020.48,3.12,2.0,Or or you will be penalized if you use this word.
34382,PS3,3,1020.68,1023.52,2.84,1.0,"I think we can, we can use pop song."
34382,PS3,3,1024.04,1026.4,2.36,1.0,"Maybe it's not, it's just a word, sorry, right."
34382,PS3,3,1026.52,1028.8,2.28,1.0,"So if it's in other language, it's OK."
34382,PS3,3,1029.32,1034.44,5.12,1.0,So we can use pop song in fact to create a very viral song to replace the word.
34382,PS3,3,1034.44,1036.24,1.8,1.0,Sorry for other language.
34382,PS3,3,1036.76,1039.88,3.12,1.0,"Oh, so it becomes a thing everyone knows about the song?"
34382,PS3,3,1040.0,1041.68,1.68,2.0,And then it becomes like a trend like.
34382,PS3,3,1041.84,1043.24,1.4,1.0,"A replacement of that word, yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1043.96,1046.68,2.72,3.0,So you mean if we say sorry in a different language then?
34382,PS3,3,1046.92,1047.32,0.4,1.0,I think so.
34382,PS3,3,1047.32,1050.56,3.24,3.0,Pandemic won't spread so it's only for English speaking countries.
34382,PS3,3,1050.64,1051.16,0.52,1.0,I don't know.
34382,PS3,3,1051.36,1051.88,0.52,1.0,Let's assume.
34382,PS3,3,1052.08,1055.4,3.32,2.0,So they say they they said sorry is the word.
34382,PS3,3,1055.84,1061.12,5.28,2.0,Or maybe we can we can just replace sorry with a completely new word altogether.
34382,PS3,3,1061.2,1063.08,1.88,1.0,"By by pop song, Yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1063.16,1065.84,2.68,1.0,"Or or pop culture, you can say."
34382,PS3,3,1066.84,1069.48,2.64,3.0,"Yeah, I think that's a good idea, creative idea."
34382,PS3,3,1069.72,1070.12,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,1071.52,1072.4,0.88,3.0,"So we should, yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1072.56,1075.68,3.12,3.0,So because it will be adopted very quickly by people.
34382,PS3,3,1078.12,1078.48,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,1079.68,1085.04,5.36,1.0,And then important thing is also to to bend that word in the TV or radio.
34382,PS3,3,1085.88,1090.84,4.96,1.0,"So then it becomes a beep word automatically otherwise and it it spreads easily, right?"
34382,PS3,3,1090.92,1092.8,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, from the from the TV."
34382,PS3,3,1092.88,1095.52,2.64,2.0,So what we can do is first is replace.
34382,PS3,3,1095.68,1098.24,2.56,2.0,"OK, replace the word, sorry."
34382,PS3,3,1098.68,1099.52,0.84,1.0,Buy a new word.
34382,PS3,3,1100.28,1102.16,1.88,2.0,Buy a completely a new word and.
34382,PS3,3,1104.56,1108.04,3.48,3.0,Popularize it through use of artists like.
34382,PS3,3,1108.72,1122.16,13.44,2.0,"Yeah, then popularize or spread."
34382,PS3,3,1123.4,1124.0,0.6,1.0,Awareness.
34382,PS3,3,1141.78,1147.1,5.32,3.0,And also disincentivize it by penalizing people for saying sorry like.
34382,PS3,3,1147.42,1150.2,2.78,2.0,"Oh yeah, yeah, we can penalize."
34382,PS3,3,1150.2,1151.36,1.16,3.0,Them monetary final.
34382,PS3,3,1151.72,1155.4,3.68,1.0,Get the get the illness anyways if they say sorry.
34382,PS3,3,1156.68,1157.2,0.52,3.0,And they'll.
34382,PS3,3,1157.32,1158.68,1.36,1.0,If they say sorry then.
34382,PS3,3,1159.12,1159.8,0.68,2.0,They'll get the the the.
34382,PS3,3,1159.8,1160.16,0.36,1.0,Sickness.
34382,PS3,3,1162.4,1162.92,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, that's."
34382,PS3,3,1162.92,1163.2,0.28,2.0,Fine.
34382,PS3,3,1163.2,1165.96,2.76,2.0,"But we, but we, we penalize them."
34382,PS3,3,1166.24,1168.36,2.12,2.0,We penalize them so that they don't use it again.
34382,PS3,3,1168.92,1171.0,2.08,3.0,"Yeah, that will be deterrent."
34382,PS3,3,1171.0,1177.64,6.64,3.0,"Basically, if I say that if you type again you you will have to give me $20, then you won't type."
34382,PS3,3,1177.68,1177.8,0.12,2.0,Right.
34382,PS3,3,1177.8,1179.92,2.12,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, penalize."
34382,PS3,3,1183.6,1185.48,1.88,1.0,Maybe another one can be.
34382,PS3,3,1187.08,1188.12,1.04,3.0,To create deterrence.
34382,PS3,3,1188.12,1191.88,3.76,3.0,Basically penalize to say the word to create deterrence.
34382,PS3,3,1192.32,1198.2,5.88,1.0,"Another one can be when you oh, but it's only by saying it's not typing in the keyboard."
34382,PS3,3,1201.64,1203.24,1.6,2.0,Deterrence is spelled like this.
34382,PS3,3,1203.24,1203.36,0.12,3.0,Right.
34382,PS3,3,1203.36,1204.0,0.64,3.0,Double RI.
34382,PS3,3,1204.0,1208.04,4.04,3.0,Think double R.
34382,PS3,3,1208.2,1208.6,0.4,1.0,I think so.
34382,PS3,3,1209.0,1217.32,8.32,1.0,I think if iPhone or like any of the electronic device catch that word then it can create a very loud amount like.
34382,PS3,3,1220.12,1222.88,2.76,3.0,So you use AI algorithms to.
34382,PS3,3,1223.04,1224.4,1.36,1.0,They are listening anyways.
34382,PS3,3,1224.8,1227.64,2.84,3.0,"Yeah, to remove the word sorry from any kind of."
34382,PS3,3,1227.8,1228.64,0.84,2.0,"Yeah, use."
34382,PS3,3,1229.4,1230.52,1.12,3.0,Broadcast or
34382,PS3,3,1230.64,1231.4,0.76,1.0,Social media.
34382,PS3,3,1231.64,1232.72,1.08,3.0,Social media to.
34382,PS3,3,1237.12,1244.08,6.96,2.0,Remove the word sorry from any other social media.
34382,PS3,3,1249.56,1250.28,0.72,3.0,One idea.
34382,PS3,3,1250.28,1253.0,2.72,3.0,"I mean, it would be a very destructive idea."
34382,PS3,3,1253.68,1254.88,1.2,3.0,"No, it doesn't make sense."
34382,PS3,3,1266.75,1266.95,0.2,2.0,What?
34382,PS3,3,1266.95,1268.19,1.24,2.0,What space is this?
34382,PS3,3,1268.95,1270.23,1.28,2.0,This is for just for the staff.
34382,PS3,3,1271.51,1273.59,2.08,2.0,"Our MBA team doesn't sit here, right?"
34382,PS3,3,1275.16,1276.8,1.64,2.0,I can see the library folks.
34382,PS3,3,1277.04,1277.44,0.4,2.0,I can.
34382,PS3,3,1277.44,1280.28,2.84,2.0,I saw the library coordinator and all.
34382,PS3,3,1280.48,1281.8,1.32,2.0,"I think this is enough, right?"
34382,PS3,3,1283.8,1285.8,2.0,3.0,"Let's think for maybe one more minute, OK?"
34382,PS3,3,1289.12,1297.2,8.08,1.0,I think the one I just said like when when iPhone or any digital device catch the word then it creates a loud alarm to to frighten.
34382,PS3,3,1297.2,1298.88,1.68,2.0,"People OK, OK."
34382,PS3,3,1300.56,1303.44,2.88,1.0,"I just want to trigger the alarm to feel embarrassed, right?"
34382,PS3,3,1309.76,1327.68,17.92,3.0,"Also when you're about to say a sentence that might involve sorry, it will beep you or vibrate something you you can give people some devices or something that has AI which is monitoring your speech and it will before you say it, it will."
34382,PS3,3,1327.68,1328.68,1.0,2.0,Before you say it vibrate.
34382,PS3,3,1329.88,1331.56,1.68,1.0,And they like caution.
34382,PS3,3,1331.92,1332.28,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,1340.88,1356.48,15.6,3.0,"And also maybe if if we do a demographic like study, if if I mean if there is a statistically significant difference, for example, older people say sorry more more I mean frequently than younger."
34382,PS3,3,1356.48,1360.6,4.12,3.0,Maybe try to separate them from groups.
34382,PS3,3,1361.68,1367.28,5.6,3.0,"Take some measures to so that they are, otherwise they will be basically."
34382,PS3,3,1367.28,1367.36,0.08,2.0,Who?
34382,PS3,3,1367.52,1375.4,7.88,3.0,Is who is the more likely propagator of the disease and then try to separate them like it works for biological virus.
34382,PS3,3,1395.32,1396.12,0.8,3.0,By monitoring.
34382,PS3,3,1396.12,1397.36,1.24,1.0,"I mean it depends, right?"
34382,PS3,3,1397.36,1407.56,10.2,1.0,"If it's be like a very serious pandemic, then you wouldn't even allow them to go out of the home not to interact with anyone."
34382,PS3,3,1407.96,1416.12,8.16,1.0,"Like if people catch it it it's going to die, then obviously it's the most extreme measures where you can't say anything to anyone."
34382,PS3,3,1419.88,1422.48,2.6,3.0,"We can't find any cure to this, right?"
34382,PS3,3,1423.52,1425.24,1.72,1.0,That's too long like that.
34382,PS3,3,1425.24,1426.36,1.12,1.0,That's too far apart.
34382,PS3,3,1429.72,1431.64,1.92,2.0,"Cool, you're gonna submit this."
34382,PS3,3,1431.68,1432.08,0.4,2.0,Or you can.
34382,PS3,3,1432.24,1433.96,1.72,1.0,"You can put in a point as well, like yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1434.6,1435.16,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1435.16,1437.12,1.96,3.0,Isolate groups that are more.
34382,PS3,3,1437.92,1438.72,0.8,2.0,More likely to say.
34382,PS3,3,1438.72,1439.92,1.2,3.0,More likely to use the.
34382,PS3,3,1440.4,1446.84,6.44,2.0,Isolate more like groups that are more likely to say sorry that are more likely to use the word.
34382,PS3,3,1450.64,1451.48,0.84,3.0,And what were you saying?
34382,PS3,3,1451.76,1451.96,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,1451.96,1452.68,0.72,3.0,Were you saying something?
34382,PS3,3,1452.68,1457.2,4.52,1.0,Different the the what's you call like there's a word of it.
34382,PS3,3,1457.52,1460.96,3.44,1.0,"Oh, I even forgot the word like you spread you stay at home."
34382,PS3,3,1460.96,1462.12,1.16,1.0,Basically you have to.
34382,PS3,3,1462.16,1464.44,2.28,2.0,"Say you I, Yeah."
34382,PS3,3,1464.6,1467.12,2.52,1.0,"There's a word quarantine, quarantine, quarantine."
34382,PS3,3,1468.84,1475.68,6.84,3.0,"Yeah, one another measure could be the quarantine people as much as possible quarantine actually that should be the first step."
34382,PS3,3,1476.76,1485.04,8.28,3.0,"And then you spread these info and then you start releasing them, releasing the quarantine restrictions gradually."
34382,PS3,3,1486.4,1487.84,1.44,3.0,"That should be the first step, I guess."
34382,PS3,3,1488.0,1488.16,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
34382,PS3,3,1488.32,1492.04,3.72,3.0,"So that there is there are no mass gatherings, varied conspirations."
34382,PS3,3,1495.16,1496.52,1.36,2.0,"Cool, this is fine."
34382,PS3,3,1496.72,1497.4,0.68,2.0,Submitting this.
35836,PS5,6,0.12,1.44,1.32,1.0,"The last one, yeah, OK, that's."
35836,PS5,6,1.48,1.68,0.2,2.0,OK.
35836,PS5,6,1.68,7.2,5.52,2.0,"I think we should discuss like orally because yeah, summing up well, like it's not bad."
35836,PS5,6,9.16,22.41,13.25,1.0,What happens when employee?
35836,PS5,6,22.41,22.93,0.52,3.0,Decides.
35836,PS5,6,23.97,26.05,2.08,4.0,So I think we've got to decide why people are leaving.
35836,PS5,6,26.77,28.21,1.44,4.0,Is it you know?
35836,PS5,6,28.45,28.89,0.44,1.0,What is?
35836,PS5,6,28.97,31.09,2.12,1.0,What is what voluntary attribution actually?
35836,PS5,6,32.52,33.56,1.04,4.0,What is attrition?
35836,PS5,6,33.84,34.4,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, what is?"
35836,PS5,6,34.4,36.96,2.56,4.0,So they're just leaving the job either?
35836,PS5,6,37.68,38.12,0.44,1.0,I see.
35836,PS5,6,38.44,42.16,3.72,4.0,It it doesn't say either to go somewhere else or just to stop working.
35836,PS5,6,42.68,45.36,2.68,5.0,I think it's what isn't it like relatively easy to to do.
35836,PS5,6,45.92,47.84,1.92,5.0,We need to think about the reason why they leave.
35836,PS5,6,48.16,54.08,5.92,5.0,"It's because they are not rewarded, rewarded enough the way that they want and because it's a voluntary job."
35836,PS5,6,54.08,58.52,4.44,5.0,So the only way for you to do it is to give you some economical incentive for them to do.
35836,PS5,6,58.84,60.44,1.6,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35836,PS5,6,61.28,61.72,0.44,4.0,So.
35836,PS5,6,62.08,64.84,2.76,3.0,But then how how creative is just giving people?
35836,PS5,6,64.84,66.04,1.2,1.0,Money work.
35836,PS5,6,66.04,66.36,0.32,4.0,A job.
35836,PS5,6,66.92,68.24,1.32,1.0,"That sort of way, right?"
35836,PS5,6,69.96,73.64,3.68,3.0,Maybe they want us to think about more like quality of life things.
35836,PS5,6,73.64,74.2,0.56,1.0,Quality of life.
35836,PS5,6,74.76,81.12,6.36,3.0,"More behaviourally, how can you make someone feel engaged and mentally rewarded by being in a job?"
35836,PS5,6,81.96,82.88,0.92,1.0,Well then.
35836,PS5,6,82.88,84.08,1.2,5.0,Mental reward is.
35836,PS5,6,84.28,89.84,5.56,1.0,"The key then, we should have a system and mechanism to encourage some kind of."
35836,PS5,6,90.24,96.04,5.8,4.0,"So, you know, you're going to think a big reason why lots of people leave the workforce is to have children or to recur to children."
35836,PS5,6,96.24,97.44,1.2,4.0,So that could be a point.
35836,PS5,6,97.52,112.8,15.28,4.0,"I know it's only, you know, in half, but either with increased maternity leave or paternity leave or, you know, providing childcare free of charge, that's going to make a lot of people more likely to stay in work rather than leave the workforce."
35836,PS5,6,115.56,124.16,8.6,2.0,"What about like contracts where you sign up for like I'm going to work like in a company for a year at least, like, oh what, 10 years?"
35836,PS5,6,124.16,124.56,0.4,2.0,Who knows?
35836,PS5,6,124.96,139.28,14.32,2.0,"And like, but you can like break this like contract if it's like something like maternity leave, maternity leave like special occasions, but not like voluntary like just."
35836,PS5,6,140.04,144.68,4.64,4.0,"Contract, obviously people are going to like."
35836,PS5,6,145.56,146.36,0.8,2.0,"That yeah, but like."

35801,PS5,6,127.47,134.47,7.0,2.0,"Matters like maybe we could come up with an idea that a policy maker would implement, or an idea that the firm itself would implement."
35801,PS5,6,135.71,142.92,7.21,2.0,Like it's up to us depending on what idea we come up with because it doesn't specify.
35801,PS5,6,143.24,144.44,1.2,2.0,So I think that's open-ended.
35801,PS5,6,165.09,165.45,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35801,PS5,6,165.45,173.73,8.28,3.0,"I guess if the employees, they just left the company, then it means that the company lose some kind of value."
35801,PS5,6,173.73,188.84,15.11,3.0,"So yeah, I guess maybe we can somehow make the, I don't know, the decision of the employees kind of attached to the value of the company somehow."
35801,PS5,6,189.36,194.64,5.28,3.0,If they leave then they will lose some part of it themselves.
35801,PS5,6,195.36,197.2,1.84,2.0,Or they have to pay for the loss.
35801,PS5,6,197.2,204.68,7.48,2.0,"If you can quantify how much, how valuable this person is to the company, they have to pay that much for leaving."
35801,PS5,6,205.24,206.72,1.48,2.0,"Or like, I don't know, that's kind of stupid."
35801,PS5,6,206.96,207.0,0.04,2.0,I.
35801,PS5,6,209.36,216.04,6.68,3.0,"Guess it's just not creative so you know, can make employees."
35801,PS5,6,216.4,217.2,0.8,4.0,Have nowhere to go.
35801,PS5,6,218.12,224.88,6.76,1.0,"No, I was thinking like, because if you think about it like, you know how?"
35801,PS5,6,226.0,235.16,9.16,2.0,"Like when you use social media or something, you have algorithms which can detect like based on things that you search up or do what kind of like what you know."
35801,PS5,6,235.16,240.2,5.04,2.0,"Like for example, if like I'm searching up flights and suddenly I'll get like a bunch of like travel advertisements."
35801,PS5,6,241.0,255.48,14.48,2.0,"So I feel like you can, there might there could be like a bot or something in the company like computer which can detect like whether someone is searching for new jobs and then that's like early action like you can, I'm pretty sure you can find out if you had something like that."
35801,PS5,6,255.48,255.68,0.2,2.0,You can.
35801,PS5,6,255.68,256.08,0.4,5.0,Find out?
35801,PS5,6,258.44,259.04,0.6,5.0,"Probably, yeah."
35801,PS5,6,259.44,261.32,1.88,2.0,"But then like, yeah."
35801,PS5,6,261.68,263.36,1.68,2.0,And then like if you notice that one.
35801,PS5,6,263.36,264.16,0.8,1.0,Of your employees is.
35801,PS5,6,264.16,265.76,1.6,2.0,Looking to change their job?
35801,PS5,6,265.76,275.32,9.56,2.0,"You can like, I don't know, shit on other companies and like they're not good to work for or something like like try to alter their decision making process."
35801,PS5,6,275.32,275.52,0.2,2.0,But if?
35801,PS5,6,277.72,279.32,1.6,4.0,We just give give them more money.
35801,PS5,6,282.48,306.64,24.16,6.0,"Maybe adding something in the contract that you know, obligates them to, to, to obligate them to, to give up on some of their, their benefits if they wanted to live within within less than one year or two years."
35801,PS5,6,309.0,315.56,6.56,6.0,"I, I've seen this happened, you know, I mean, I've seen it when I used to work in Dubai."
35801,PS5,6,317.0,327.92,10.92,6.0,"This company used to suffer from high rate of turnover to so in, in, in a specific position, which is the secretary position."
35801,PS5,6,329.72,351.36,21.64,6.0,"So on the higher third secretary after the after multiple resignations, they, they, they, they told her that if you decided to resign before two years, in less than two years, you're going to have to, you will not take any, any benefits or something like this."
35801,PS5,6,355.32,357.76,2.44,1.0,There's one thing we can do is for those talented.
35801,PS5,6,358.16,368.4,10.24,5.0,"Employees, we can increase the free you know that in each company they do the 360 employee survey and the survey will ask how would you reach your team later, how would you reach your firm?"
35801,PS5,6,368.4,386.4,18.0,5.0,"Like all sorts of questions and the company can select those talented employee and increase the frequency of those survey and asking questions like how like on a scale from one to 10, how likely you would leave the company or how how many years would you reckon you will stay in this company."
35801,PS5,6,386.8,395.48,8.68,5.0,And they will do analysis from the answers and then probably have a discussion with those employees who are having a higher risk of living.
35801,PS5,6,396.08,412.4,16.32,5.0,"And then also if they already submitted their resignation application, we can still have a like if we are in the position of the company, we can still have a discussion with them to provide a counter offer if they're going to another company, how much they offer it."
35801,PS5,6,422.92,424.52,1.6,2.0,"That is the most practical, yeah."
35801,PS5,6,426.08,426.8,0.72,5.0,I'm not creative.
35801,PS5,6,428.04,428.76,0.72,3.0,Least creative?
35801,PS5,6,440.83,445.47,4.64,2.0,"It's not like you just want to disincentivize it, you want to stop it, is what The thing is saying."
35801,PS5,6,447.19,447.67,0.48,1.0,So.
35801,PS5,6,462.12,462.36,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35801,PS5,6,462.36,482.76,20.4,3.0,"I guess maybe the creative part can be the, I don't know, maybe we can automate the assessments of those questionnaires we collected from, you know, employees and just like give them a score and then they can algorithm to decide what to do with each of those employees."
35801,PS5,6,483.4,496.16,12.76,3.0,"Maybe to, yeah, just raise the salary for some of them or yeah, just to yeah, come up with any kind of yeah, other benefits for them."
35801,PS5,6,496.16,501.64,5.48,3.0,"And yeah, just to automate the whole process by using some algorithms maybe."
35801,PS5,6,501.96,504.16,2.2,1.0,"Right, so you're saying like it it for example?"
35801,PS5,6,505.2,515.68,10.48,2.0,"Assuming HR deals with this kind of stuff, they could have an additional like system, like a new system that focuses specifically on this issue, yeah."
35801,PS5,6,515.84,524.04,8.2,1.0,And but sometimes people leave their jobs not because of the.
35801,PS5,6,524.08,532.24,8.16,5.0,"Salary, but also because of the like the leaders of the people who are working with, they're having some conflicts."
35801,PS5,6,533.2,533.68,0.48,1.0,Yeah.
35801,PS5,6,535.04,548.2,13.16,2.0,"So then the automated system could aggregate all of that information, everything that's happening in the office down to like interact like interactions within teams and stuff, and then come up with a likelihood that each person is going to leave."
35801,PS5,6,548.2,552.68,4.48,2.0,And then that way you can start offering them more benefits or start like.
35801,PS5,6,554.64,556.44,1.8,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
35801,PS5,6,557.2,558.64,1.44,2.0,Do we want to go ahead with that idea?
35801,PS5,6,559.12,565.16,6.04,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
35801,PS5,6,583.16,602.44,19.28,1.0,And the employees behave business and what else?
35801,PS5,6,602.44,610.52,8.08,4.0,Student dynamics What dynamics in the company and?
35801,PS5,6,612.12,612.68,0.56,1.0,Behaviours.
35801,PS5,6,612.68,613.84,1.16,1.0,Team dynamics.
35801,PS5,6,616.52,617.56,1.04,2.0,Also it could be like.
35801,PS5,6,617.6,625.76,8.16,1.0,What the employees personal goals are like if they if their personal goals are not met in this company then that would also make them more like.
35801,PS5,6,627.44,630.16,2.72,2.0,"But I guess that could fall under employee satisfaction, right?"
35801,PS5,6,630.88,635.96,5.08,4.0,And also maybe the situation of the job market.
35801,PS5,6,636.72,643.8,7.08,1.0,"Right, external factors like your market."
35801,PS5,6,644.24,645.08,0.84,2.0,Conditions.
35801,PS5,6,647.8,660.36,12.56,1.0,"I'll just put an end here to generate a probability, yeah."
35801,PS5,6,687.72,691.08,3.36,3.0,And what that will cost the company maybe?
35801,PS5,6,691.32,691.68,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35801,PS5,6,697.08,703.0,5.92,4.0,Oh and also maybe evaluate their value like employees value.
35801,PS5,6,703.84,706.0,2.16,1.0,"Yeah, I guess that is incorporated."
35801,PS5,6,706.0,706.56,0.56,2.0,Here when?
35801,PS5,6,707.84,709.2,1.36,1.0,What that will cost the company?
35801,PS5,6,709.2,709.48,0.28,2.0,In terms.
35801,PS5,6,709.48,712.8,3.32,1.0,"Of lost value, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,5.92,8.52,2.6,1.0,"Encouraging people to swim, sing in the shower."
35278,PS6,3,15.36,21.04,5.68,2.0,"I mean, people know that that's a thing, I think, but it's just the 20 minutes."
35278,PS6,3,21.68,22.12,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,22.32,25.2,2.88,2.0,Like it's common knowledge singing in the shower signifies you're quite happy.
35278,PS6,3,25.32,26.48,1.16,1.0,"Yeah, I think it's good for health."
35278,PS6,3,26.56,30.24,3.68,1.0,Absolutely agree to encourage people to do it.
35278,PS6,3,32.4,36.16,3.76,3.0,The first thing would be to encourage people to take a long shower is in 20 minutes.
35278,PS6,3,36.64,38.92,2.28,3.0,"Yeah, who has time to take shower for 20 minutes?"
35278,PS6,3,39.16,39.96,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,40.08,43.4,3.32,2.0,A lot of people take showers to save water and 20 minutes is quite a while.
35278,PS6,3,43.88,45.56,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, completely, completely agree."
35278,PS6,3,45.68,45.72,0.04,1.0,I.
35278,PS6,3,45.76,47.68,1.92,2.0,Mean you could we have to write this?
35278,PS6,3,48.76,50.12,1.36,1.0,Let's let's type some notes.
35278,PS6,3,50.64,56.04,5.4,2.0,That's why not so I think it's a general fact singing in the shower is a sign of happiness.
35278,PS6,3,56.4,57.12,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
35278,PS6,3,58.04,58.36,0.32,1.0,Agree that.
35278,PS6,3,64.2,72.04,7.84,2.0,"I think from what you're said, you're going to have to encourage people to take longer showers because technically they, they want to save water by taking a shower."
35278,PS6,3,72.56,76.44,3.88,2.0,"So you could add to this by being like, well, hot and cold."
35278,PS6,3,76.44,83.44,7.0,2.0,Switching between that's true is very healthy for you because it helps you firmly regulate.
35278,PS6,3,84.68,85.44,0.76,2.0,"Yeah, it helps."
35278,PS6,3,86.8,89.08,2.28,2.0,I think cold showers are also good for detoxing.
35278,PS6,3,90.92,97.32,6.4,2.0,"So kind of add in as to why you'd want to take a longer shower, and then maybe something to say why you'd want to sing and."
35278,PS6,3,98.4,98.68,0.28,1.0,Then again.
35278,PS6,3,99.68,101.6,1.92,3.0,I don't think it has to be a shower.
35278,PS6,3,101.6,108.4,6.8,3.0,It can be incorporated in a steam bath like a sauna setting along with the shower.
35278,PS6,3,109.0,109.8,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, one of."
35278,PS6,3,110.0,117.16,7.16,3.0,"People who don't, who want to use less water, they can opt for water efficient."
35278,PS6,3,118.16,128.44,10.28,1.0,"Shower I'm thinking we're, we're, we're making waterproof microphones too."
35278,PS6,3,132.4,133.2,0.8,1.0,"Actually, a people."
35278,PS6,3,133.2,133.64,0.44,1.0,People.
35278,PS6,3,133.64,143.24,9.6,2.0,"Are using an advert or a video to show this of like, happy, bubbly people coming out there, going into the shower sad and then being, like, putting some music on."
35278,PS6,3,143.76,146.32,2.56,2.0,"Yeah, singing out loud and coming out and being like, do you know what?"
35278,PS6,3,146.88,147.8,0.92,2.0,I'm so much better.
35278,PS6,3,147.92,148.88,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, 100%."
35278,PS6,3,149.28,150.8,1.52,2.0,"Like a visual aid, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,151.72,152.84,1.12,1.0,What about music?
35278,PS6,3,153.12,154.24,1.12,1.0,"Yeah, music."
35278,PS6,3,158.0,159.44,1.44,1.0,Soundproof toilets.
35278,PS6,3,159.84,160.32,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,160.32,160.64,0.32,1.0,Sure.
35278,PS6,3,160.64,161.24,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, why not?"
35278,PS6,3,162.64,163.4,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, that's true."
35278,PS6,3,163.4,166.12,2.72,1.0,Or like soundproof in the actual shower itself.
35278,PS6,3,166.4,169.36,2.96,1.0,So like now I can hear you people are people aren't worried about that.
35278,PS6,3,173.04,174.16,1.12,2.0,And they could just do it at home.
35278,PS6,3,174.96,175.64,0.68,1.0,"Yeah, that's true."
35278,PS6,3,176.88,181.0,4.12,2.0,"I think, yeah, just encourage the idea of getting your emotions out."
35278,PS6,3,181.4,197.56,16.16,2.0,"Like, OK, singing is one of them, but just kind of a general, general idea of let's put music on, let's live out everything and let's make the shower really cleanse us like from all the bad and hard work or prepare us for a good buzzing day."
35278,PS6,3,197.56,197.6,0.04,2.0,I.
35278,PS6,3,198.04,198.32,0.28,1.0,Agree.
35278,PS6,3,198.32,202.56,4.24,1.0,Combine it with the concept of a good shower.

35278,PS6,3,204.84,205.2,0.36,1.0,Cool.
35278,PS6,3,206.48,208.92,2.44,1.0,How are we going to encourage people to like advert?
35278,PS6,3,211.84,212.56,0.72,2.0,What we've done that.
35278,PS6,3,213.04,215.48,2.44,1.0,"Yeah, what about like, hosting a fun competition?"
35278,PS6,3,216.36,219.28,2.92,2.0,"You can stay in the shower and sing like a karaoke, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,221.08,224.08,3.0,1.0,Funk competition Karaoke.
35278,PS6,3,226.4,227.12,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, you know what?"
35278,PS6,3,227.12,228.64,1.52,1.0,Why are we saying karaoke bars?
35278,PS6,3,228.64,230.84,2.2,1.0,They install like a shower room to make it the norm.
35278,PS6,3,231.84,236.32,4.48,1.0,Karaoke bar Install shower rooms.
35278,PS6,3,237.72,241.16,3.44,2.0,"Also it isn't actually water, it could be foam like foam parties and singing, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,241.56,244.24,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, Yeah, yeah, we."
35278,PS6,3,244.24,247.44,3.2,2.0,"Could it's probably easier than yeah, pouring people."
35278,PS6,3,247.52,247.96,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, Why?"
35278,PS6,3,248.12,248.36,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,248.36,253.08,4.72,1.0,"Or we could just make clubs really wet, just that you have showers in a club bring."
35278,PS6,3,254.92,256.68,1.76,2.0,"A change of clothes, like a gym."
35278,PS6,3,256.92,257.56,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, why not?"
35278,PS6,3,258.04,260.24,2.2,1.0,"Oh, you know what we've put combined with a gym?"

35278,PS6,3,272.64,277.08,4.44,1.0,"Indeed, I like this because we need one creative idea."
35278,PS6,3,277.48,280.48,3.0,1.0,So I So what are we thinking?
35278,PS6,3,280.48,281.88,1.4,1.0,I like the idea of wet yoga.
35278,PS6,3,283.24,288.52,5.28,2.0,You're already established in hot yoga and you sweat so much that and you get a wide range of people coming to it.
35278,PS6,3,288.56,288.88,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,289.68,296.64,6.96,3.0,"Well, the idea could be to get people to stay in the shower longer and how that idea could be achieved is by these things."
35278,PS6,3,297.32,302.48,5.16,3.0,The idea would be to get people to stay in the shower for as long as at least 20 minutes.
35278,PS6,3,302.52,305.16,2.64,2.0,"But we need, we need to think of something that will encourage."
35278,PS6,3,305.16,309.32,4.16,1.0,"People to do that, so I'm thinking hosting a wet yoga class."
35278,PS6,3,309.68,318.72,9.04,1.0,"So going around to say all these fancy yoga studios and then like W London where you get these people that have nothing else to do, they're looking for a fun workout."
35278,PS6,3,318.96,319.36,0.4,1.0,Why not?
35278,PS6,3,319.36,322.84,3.48,1.0,"Let's say, OK, let's do a wet yoga singing session."
35278,PS6,3,323.28,323.4,0.12,2.0,Yeah.

35278,PS6,3,332.52,336.64,4.12,1.0,"And then that gets people in a group, which will encourage it as well, like singing along in a group."
35278,PS6,3,337.0,340.36,3.36,2.0,"It's not by yourself, you popular radio songs."
35278,PS6,3,340.92,342.88,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, group."
35278,PS6,3,344.36,348.12,3.76,1.0,And I guess like you have similarly hen parties doing it.
35278,PS6,3,348.12,353.24,5.12,1.0,They'd love that because you have like obviously spin class.
35278,PS6,3,353.28,359.36,6.08,1.0,"Then people go home and do it, say buy a bloody Peloton, but then we'll be like, well, you could just do it in your shower yourself."
35278,PS6,3,359.64,361.36,1.72,1.0,"You don't need a, you don't need a Peloton for it."
35278,PS6,3,362.84,363.04,0.2,2.0,Great.
35278,PS6,3,363.64,370.96,7.32,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, we, we can even have like a peloton like app where it's like competitions."
35278,PS6,3,373.6,374.68,1.08,2.0,"You know, like ideas."
35278,PS6,3,375.8,378.2,2.4,2.0,"Yeah, songs."
35278,PS6,3,378.52,380.12,1.6,1.0,"Generations, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,383.16,383.52,0.36,2.0,Songs.
35278,PS6,3,383.92,385.2,1.28,2.0,Playlist generators.
35278,PS6,3,385.44,385.76,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,389.12,402.04,12.92,1.0,So I'm thinking we use all of the above to get us to this concept of wet singing yoga or exception in hot.
35278,PS6,3,402.04,407.48,5.44,1.0,"In hot yoga, we know that there's a market for people that are whatever, doing weird, weird."
35278,PS6,3,407.48,409.16,1.68,2.0,"Workouts, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,409.16,422.08,12.92,1.0,"And like if people, as you say, will go to a spin class and sing and clap their hands, why won't they go and have like a wet room and have a shower and then building onto it to encourage people to stick with it?"
35278,PS6,3,422.36,425.28,2.92,1.0,A Peloton like app where you'd host competitions.
35278,PS6,3,426.88,429.68,2.8,2.0,"And you could also like even run a study on it to be like, right."
35278,PS6,3,429.76,431.96,2.2,2.0,How much has this helped you with your well-being?
35278,PS6,3,431.96,432.84,0.88,2.0,How much is?
35278,PS6,3,433.04,433.4,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,433.92,436.28,2.36,2.0,You know what makes us stand out for you?
35278,PS6,3,436.28,441.24,4.96,2.0,"It's not going to be for everyone, but there's a probably a certain amount of people you could encourage to do this."
35278,PS6,3,441.44,441.72,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,444.96,446.84,1.88,2.0,Have we gone into Chinese?
35278,PS6,3,446.96,447.16,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,450.12,450.88,0.76,2.0,"Oh, go back."
35278,PS6,3,451.76,452.0,0.24,1.0,No.
35278,PS6,3,455.04,456.0,0.96,2.0,And you're gone.
35278,PS6,3,459.08,459.32,0.24,1.0,No.
35278,PS6,3,460.6,461.16,0.56,1.0,What did I press?
35278,PS6,3,461.32,462.28,0.96,1.0,"Oh, OK, there we go."
35278,PS6,3,462.36,462.96,0.6,1.0,There's shift.
35278,PS6,3,466.12,468.48,2.36,1.0,"OK, so let's structure this a little bit."
35278,PS6,3,469.8,470.28,0.48,1.0,Let's do.
35278,PS6,3,476.04,476.72,0.68,1.0,And then here.
35278,PS6,3,480.96,485.4,4.44,2.0,"Just the whole idea of if they went to wet yoga, they'd probably end up singing in the shower too."
35278,PS6,3,485.72,489.6,3.88,1.0,"Yeah, singing yoga."
35278,PS6,3,490.84,513.36,22.52,1.0,"OK so OK, go to premium yoga studios, ask them to install shower like rooms making the entire collapse damp."
35278,PS6,3,515.8,517.92,2.12,3.0,The shower like rooms already do exist.
35278,PS6,3,518.08,519.92,1.84,3.0,"They're called green rooms or something, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,519.92,526.68,6.76,2.0,"Yeah, that's they could also use it in Spas."
35278,PS6,3,527.52,527.8,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,528.28,532.44,4.16,2.0,Because they always have steam rooms in spas you could just turn the temperature down for.
35278,PS6,3,532.44,533.04,0.6,1.0,Pete's sake.
35278,PS6,3,538.68,538.72,0.04,1.0,Oh.
35278,PS6,3,540.12,540.68,0.56,2.0,What have we done?
35278,PS6,3,545.56,547.04,1.48,1.0,"Now OK, we're we're back."
35278,PS6,3,547.04,551.12,4.08,1.0,We're back rear Ray making a stamp.
35278,PS6,3,551.36,559.4,8.04,1.0,I just have someone what's going on with this keyboard energetic to lead the.
35278,PS6,3,559.6,562.96,3.36,2.0,Class which most exercise to music instructors are.
35278,PS6,3,563.44,563.68,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,566.16,572.68,6.52,2.0,"And also maybe it doesn't have to be like a weekly thing, it could be a monthly event more than an actual yeah class."
35278,PS6,3,572.68,580.04,7.36,2.0,Because then the whole idea of getting someone into this I think will help them to then start singing in the shower because they'll probably find it quite fun.
35278,PS6,3,580.2,580.4,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35278,PS6,3,581.64,582.08,0.44,2.0,You'd hope.
35278,PS6,3,584.84,586.72,1.88,2.0,I still think 20 minutes is a very long time.
35278,PS6,3,587.0,588.72,1.72,1.0,"Yeah, but I have to enjoy it."
35278,PS6,3,590.56,593.08,2.52,3.0,"I don't know, it's hard to make time in the morning for."
35278,PS6,3,593.48,594.4,0.92,2.0,A 20 minute shower.
35278,PS6,3,594.6,596.6,2.0,3.0,Either I get take a shower or I have breakfast.
35278,PS6,3,596.72,597.56,0.84,3.0,It's one of the yeah.
35278,PS6,3,598.32,601.92,3.6,2.0,Which is probably why actually I yoga class on it.
35278,PS6,3,602.6,607.76,5.16,2.0,"It's a lot easier to encourage people to do than just let's let's sing in the shower for 20 minutes, yeah."
35278,PS6,3,609.12,617.84,8.72,1.0,Good in trouble way as actually 20 minutes is a rather long shower.
35278,PS6,3,620.16,620.4,0.24,1.0,Cool.
35278,PS6,3,620.8,621.68,0.88,1.0,"OK, I like it."
35278,PS6,3,621.68,624.92,3.24,1.0,I like it a lot and we beat the 12 minutes we beat AI.
34391,PS6,6,4.4,6.28,1.88,1.0,Part 1 is a teamwork and Part 2 is.
34391,PS6,6,9.0,9.4,0.4,3.0,Individual.
34391,PS6,6,9.84,12.2,2.36,2.0,Who wants to take up the typing job?
34391,PS6,6,24.64,25.8,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, Yeah, we can start."
34391,PS6,6,29.6,34.64,5.04,3.0,Imagine a new research study discovers that singing in the shower for 20 minutes or more is good for health.
34391,PS6,6,35.2,39.56,4.36,3.0,Please come up with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
34391,PS6,6,42.0,51.16,9.16,4.0,"Just on top of my head because I was watching an Instagram video this morning, there are certain companies that make produce shower like speakers for the bathrooms."
34391,PS6,6,51.56,53.48,1.92,4.0,So it's like waterproof.
34391,PS6,6,53.48,55.24,1.76,4.0,They have a whole casing around it.
34391,PS6,6,55.44,62.52,7.08,4.0,It's also for people who can like like use the buttons with a wet finger and like touch screen.
34391,PS6,6,62.52,70.32,7.8,4.0,It's mostly audio and it will take away the noise of the shower so that you can easily tell it to move to another song.
34391,PS6,6,70.56,73.76,3.2,4.0,"But it's like bathroom friendly, shower friendly speakers got."
34391,PS6,6,74.48,75.32,0.84,3.0,It now sounds good.
34391,PS6,6,76.04,80.12,4.08,3.0,I actually went once to to a hotel in Panama.
34391,PS6,6,80.12,85.04,4.92,3.0,"I remember and something that I loved, it was a Hard Rock Hotel."
34391,PS6,6,85.4,89.16,3.76,3.0,"So in the pool, in the pool, you're in the pool outside and you hear music."
34391,PS6,6,89.16,93.0,3.84,3.0,"But once you get into the pool, there's a different music inside the pool."
34391,PS6,6,93.4,93.56,0.16,4.0,When?
34391,PS6,6,95.44,98.6,3.16,3.0,I have a Panama when I have a pool in my house.
34391,PS6,6,100.0,101.8,1.8,4.0,"Wow, that is awesome."
34391,PS6,6,104.8,109.32,4.52,2.0,And I think one like one major step would be needed to popularize it.
34391,PS6,6,109.44,122.4,12.96,2.0,"So like maybe we, we can encourage some artists or like pop stars or so they, they made some video where displaying this kind of thing so that more people are interested in."
34391,PS6,6,122.4,125.44,3.04,3.0,Them make famous artists encouraging you had an.
34391,PS6,6,125.48,135.48,10.0,1.0,"Idea Right now, yeah, I'm thinking about there is a function in the shower only singing can switch on the water to take shower."
34391,PS6,6,135.48,135.52,0.04,1.0,Oh.
34391,PS6,6,136.0,136.48,0.48,3.0,Very good idea.
34391,PS6,6,138.04,140.4,2.36,1.0,"Because it has to last four, yeah."
34391,PS6,6,140.76,142.24,1.48,5.0,"20 minutes, that's the bigger challenge."
34391,PS6,6,142.32,146.36,4.04,1.0,I think so if if you start singing the water is gone.
34391,PS6,6,146.88,148.72,1.84,3.0,Or the water gets colder maybe?
34391,PS6,6,150.12,150.4,0.28,6.0,"No, it's."
34391,PS6,6,151.36,151.8,0.44,1.0,Not good.
34391,PS6,6,152.08,155.0,2.92,1.0,"OK, but only keep singing can keep you showering."
34391,PS6,6,155.6,159.04,3.44,3.0,"Yeah, that's a good one, because that way you encouraged to continue to."
34391,PS6,6,160.44,161.6,1.16,3.0,I didn't realize that it's a lot.
34391,PS6,6,162.0,165.68,3.68,6.0,"I like this idea, but I think that they are expensive for normal people."
34391,PS6,6,165.68,169.88,4.2,6.0,"How to encourage people who only use their cell phone, only use what is available for them?"
34391,PS6,6,169.88,179.56,9.68,6.0,"Because building this friendly music shower could be expensive, Having a shower that only work with singing is also expensive."
34391,PS6,6,179.76,182.32,2.56,6.0,"So, for example, in daily life, how can we encourage people?"
34391,PS6,6,182.6,190.6,8.0,6.0,"I like the idea of involving artists, maybe some loyalty programs, for example, Spotify free only shower."
34391,PS6,6,190.6,195.44,4.84,6.0,"I don't know, playlist of 20 minutes, 20 minutes playlist that is completely free."
34391,PS6,6,195.44,201.08,5.64,6.0,And I know how to ensure that people will use when is taking a shower.
34391,PS6,6,201.64,203.04,1.4,6.0,But I think we should.
34391,PS6,6,203.48,204.32,0.84,6.0,We should have this.
34391,PS6,6,204.48,208.8,4.32,3.0,"Maybe maybe for the for the Spotify idea, because that's good."
34391,PS6,6,209.08,213.88,4.8,3.0,There might be people with not that many resources to buy this kind of showers.
34391,PS6,6,214.4,223.88,9.48,3.0,Maybe you Spotify can I don't kind of hear water running down the shower and that enables a 20 minutes you can play this so that you can see.
34391,PS6,6,224.2,232.92,8.72,5.0,"I think one thing that we can do is like they have meditation videos and yoga videos, like involve health influencers tell them how this study was done."
34391,PS6,6,232.92,242.0,9.08,5.0,"If they buy into it, they can popularize it through social media and create like 20 minutes shower meditation videos or you know, shower singing videos."
34391,PS6,6,242.0,243.24,1.24,2.0,Singing something like that.
34391,PS6,6,245.48,249.8,4.32,3.0,I think they can help involve Spotify to give 20 minutes free sample.
34391,PS6,6,250.56,255.16,4.6,5.0,"That I just wrote in the 20 minute player, which is free even on premium platforms."
34391,PS6,6,256.76,263.24,6.48,2.0,Maybe we can make shower that throws water into pattern based on the music you're playing.
34391,PS6,6,267.28,268.56,1.28,2.0,So to give you a more.
34391,PS6,6,272.2,275.28,3.08,4.0,"Mostly be hip hop because the base of it would throw more water, yeah."
34391,PS6,6,275.8,278.88,3.08,2.0,"Something like that to give you like to feel the music, yeah."
34391,PS6,6,279.36,279.48,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34391,PS6,6,279.96,291.12,11.16,4.0,"We used to have it in back home in Pakistan in terms of there would be fountains and the the national anthem would play and then if it's like a high note, the shower, the fountains would go high or."
34391,PS6,6,292.12,292.72,0.6,2.0,Something like that.
34391,PS6,6,292.72,293.2,0.48,4.0,That's so cool.
34391,PS6,6,296.88,305.08,8.2,2.0,"But but yeah, it will just, I think to, I think enhance the experience so that people engage more."
34391,PS6,6,305.76,318.56,12.8,3.0,"Yeah, I'm trying to think of another way of, you know, do we need for people that might not be able to buy a new shower, The Spotify thing that you said is 1."
34391,PS6,6,321.56,327.6,6.04,3.0,What else?
34391,PS6,6,328.48,339.24,10.76,4.0,"Would it be like can we do like shower karaoke, like some projector that you can read the lyrics on on your wall?"
34391,PS6,6,341.28,344.24,2.96,4.0,"Instead of justice an audio experience, you also have a visual experience."
34391,PS6,6,344.76,349.72,4.96,3.0,"Yeah, like in the in the, you know, the glass doors that showers have."
34391,PS6,6,350.12,351.56,1.44,3.0,And you can see the lyrics there.
34391,PS6,6,351.56,352.2,0.64,4.0,Yeah.
34391,PS6,6,353.6,357.72,4.12,2.0,"Also, you will need to increase the adoption of Shower because it's I."
34391,PS6,6,357.88,358.88,1.0,2.0,I don't know if I understand.
34391,PS6,6,359.12,362.4,3.28,2.0,Is it only for shower if you're bathing in your bathtub?
34391,PS6,6,363.08,363.48,0.4,5.0,It doesn't.
34391,PS6,6,363.48,366.56,3.08,5.0,"I think it's like, no, it's like taking a shower, essentially being in yourself."
34391,PS6,6,367.84,368.16,0.32,2.0,"OK, I."
34391,PS6,6,369.36,370.24,0.88,1.0,Have a question?
34391,PS6,6,371.16,372.72,1.56,1.0,Do you know what to sing?
34391,PS6,6,372.72,385.4,12.68,1.0,"If you if I ask you to sing 20 minutes when you shower every day, do you know what what, what songs you want to sing for 20 minutes every day?"
34391,PS6,6,386.24,387.92,1.68,3.0,Which songs I would like to sing?
34391,PS6,6,388.08,390.08,2.0,6.0,I think that depends on what I listen to.
34391,PS6,6,391.04,393.56,2.52,1.0,"Or just as a normal person, do you know?"

34570,PS1,3,756.0,763.36,7.36,2.0,So like the amount of plastic in the oceans has to reduce and you have to have a newer version of plastic.
34570,PS1,3,763.36,765.12,1.76,2.0,Like both of them have to happen parallel.
34570,PS1,3,765.12,766.32,1.2,2.0,It can't be just one thing.

34570,PS1,3,849.88,854.68,4.8,3.0,"So to try to curb the use, we could just like deter people."
34570,PS1,3,855.6,858.8,3.2,3.0,"Like if it's already created, yeah, we can deter people from that, you know?"
34570,PS1,3,858.8,860.56,1.76,3.0,"So like, we can tax it."
34570,PS1,3,861.48,866.36,4.88,3.0,"Yeah, we can make, we can reprogram people to not want to buy it."
34570,PS1,3,867.44,868.04,0.6,3.0,We could.

34570,PS1,3,888.52,889.92,1.4,2.0,Finding alternatives for like.
34570,PS1,3,890.16,893.28,3.12,3.0,Social red flagging so.
34570,PS1,3,894.12,895.84,1.72,1.0,If you use that is already so good.
34570,PS1,3,896.32,896.64,0.32,3.0,You know.
34570,PS1,3,897.56,901.48,3.92,1.0,"Not so much, but like like like in India, there are no more plastic."
34570,PS1,3,901.48,901.96,0.48,2.0,"Bags allowed, yeah."
34570,PS1,3,901.96,902.84,0.88,2.0,"Supermarkets, yeah."
34570,PS1,3,905.96,909.84,3.88,3.0,"But if someone uses plastic, everyone has to just feel a shame."
34570,PS1,3,913.76,916.72,2.96,2.0,"I don't know how long that would work for, but yes, I think that sounds the."
34570,PS1,3,916.84,917.76,0.92,1.0,Streets would just be.
34570,PS1,3,918.36,918.56,0.2,2.0,Foolish.
34570,PS1,3,920.64,921.36,0.72,1.0,We need a lot of.
34570,PS1,3,921.36,922.68,1.32,2.0,People or.
34570,PS1,3,923.04,925.84,2.8,1.0,Landfills I just work for.
34570,PS1,3,928.0,928.44,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
34570,PS1,3,930.0,931.44,1.44,1.0,"Sorry, lots of ideas."

34570,PS1,3,931.72,932.84,1.12,2.0,So which one is?
34570,PS1,3,937.68,941.04,3.36,2.0,We train pigeons to pick up all the plaster from everywhere and then deposit.
34570,PS1,3,941.04,942.92,1.88,1.0,In so it's either monkeys or pigeons.
34570,PS1,3,942.92,945.56,2.64,1.0,"Pigeons have the aerial capabilities, which monkeys don't."
34570,PS1,3,945.56,947.96,2.4,1.0,"But then they can they you can tag team, right?"
34570,PS1,3,947.96,949.08,1.12,1.0,Like you have two forces.
34570,PS1,3,949.08,950.12,1.04,1.0,You have the Navy and the Yeah.
34570,PS1,3,950.92,951.08,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
34570,PS1,3,951.4,951.96,0.56,1.0,"No Navy, sorry."
34570,PS1,3,952.0,952.68,0.68,1.0,Air Force and.
34570,PS1,3,952.76,953.68,0.92,2.0,Air Force and the Yeah.

34570,PS1,3,955.96,956.32,0.36,2.0,Yes.
34570,PS1,3,956.88,959.32,2.44,2.0,"So then you can gather all of the plaster, but where does it go?"
34570,PS1,3,960.44,961.52,1.08,2.0,It goes to the spaceship.
34570,PS1,3,961.56,965.2,3.64,2.0,Like we put it in near a rocket and the rockers will fly out of India.
34570,PS1,3,971.72,975.96,4.24,1.0,They collect all this and then there's a way if you could mega compress everything.
34570,PS1,3,976.32,977.32,1.0,1.0,So like how?
34570,PS1,3,977.8,977.96,0.16,2.0,You.
34570,PS1,3,978.44,979.04,0.6,1.0,Vacuum pack.
34570,PS1,3,979.12,979.44,0.32,2.0,Things.
34570,PS1,3,979.68,981.16,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, instead of vacuum packing you."
34570,PS1,3,981.92,987.16,5.24,2.0,"Plastic vacuum, the plastic that's what they're doing for to remake shoes."
34570,PS1,3,988.04,992.2,4.16,2.0,"Yeah, they're like the making layers and layers and very, very, very thin layers of plastic."
34570,PS1,3,992.2,994.84,2.64,2.0,And then that's how they redo like there are plastic shoes now.
34570,PS1,3,995.0,995.44,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, so I'm."
34570,PS1,3,995.44,1001.0,5.56,1.0,"Thinking like if there's base the size of this room, I should be able to compress it to the size of that cupboard, yeah."
34570,PS1,3,1001.0,1002.28,1.28,2.0,Probably no less than that.
34570,PS1,3,1002.28,1003.0,0.72,2.0,"It's a cube, Yeah."
34570,PS1,3,1003.0,1004.64,1.64,2.0,"I mean, and then you go throw it on Mars."
34570,PS1,3,1005.72,1009.0,3.28,1.0,"So you know, in Bolly, have you watched Folly or you throw it in space?"
34570,PS1,3,1009.36,1011.84,2.48,2.0,You can go down and it reaches.
34570,PS1,3,1011.84,1013.8,1.96,1.0,"The black hole, it's a hazard."
34570,PS1,3,1013.8,1014.0,0.2,1.0,Why?
34570,PS1,3,1014.0,1015.36,1.36,1.0,Humans are going to do space travel.
34570,PS1,3,1015.36,1017.68,2.32,1.0,They're going to be killed by their own plastic 10 years down the line.
34570,PS1,3,1017.72,1023.36,5.64,2.0,"Well, they should learn a lesson for not being cognizant enough."
34570,PS1,3,1023.36,1023.8,0.44,2.0,"OK, so we're."
34570,PS1,3,1023.8,1025.44,1.64,1.0,"Going to create a natural, sorry."
34570,PS1,3,1026.56,1028.84,2.28,2.0,Do you train monkeys and pigeons?
34570,PS1,3,1029.12,1029.96,0.84,1.0,And under the sea.
34570,PS1,3,1031.08,1033.64,2.56,2.0,Seals so you never seals can go that deep.
34570,PS1,3,1034.48,1035.56,1.08,2.0,Dolphins are intelligent.
34570,PS1,3,1036.2,1037.76,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, you're outsourcing your."
34570,PS1,3,1038.16,1039.88,1.72,2.0,"Yeah, so you reprogram again."
34570,PS1,3,1040.0,1043.4,3.4,2.0,"Reprogram Pigeons, dolphins and monkeys White."
34570,PS1,3,1043.4,1043.84,0.44,1.0,Pigeons.
34570,PS1,3,1043.88,1045.96,2.08,1.0,Is there anyone else who's bigger and can take care of that?
34570,PS1,3,1047.2,1047.96,0.76,1.0,"Oh, but just ask."
34570,PS1,3,1047.96,1049.68,1.72,3.0,Kevin because we already train pigeons.
34570,PS1,3,1050.4,1050.76,0.36,3.0,Train them.
34570,PS1,3,1050.8,1051.76,0.96,1.0,Do we in the?
34570,PS1,3,1051.76,1059.68,7.92,3.0,"First, in the army, they train the pigeons still deliver messages or eagles or, you know."
34570,PS1,3,1059.68,1061.96,2.28,2.0,Hawks fly.
34570,PS1,3,1061.96,1062.56,0.6,2.0,More here.
34570,PS1,3,1068.76,1071.52,2.76,3.0,I trained.
34570,PS1,3,1071.52,1086.28,14.76,1.0,Dolphins to to collect around the world and develop a technology that can.
34570,PS1,3,1086.64,1089.64,3.0,2.0,Compress plastic into a cube.
34570,PS1,3,1090.08,1103.96,13.88,2.0,"Like stick large volumes, large volumes of plastic into a cube, which can then be thrown, which can then be sent to Mars or Venus."
34570,PS1,3,1103.96,1104.24,0.28,2.0,I don't know.
34570,PS1,3,1104.24,1108.36,4.12,2.0,"Wherever you wanna go, send it to Sun and burn more."
34570,PS1,3,1109.32,1111.56,2.24,1.0,"Sent to the Sun so then nobody gets injured, I mean."
34570,PS1,3,1111.56,1115.6,4.04,2.0,"Like, yeah, but it's gonna burn a lot of, like, bad chemicals and it's gonna come to hold those again."
34570,PS1,3,1116.52,1117.84,1.32,2.0,So basically digging it on Rave?
34570,PS1,3,1119.08,1119.96,0.88,2.0,"No, we like Mars."
34570,PS1,3,1119.96,1120.56,0.6,2.0,Let's do Venus.
34570,PS1,3,1120.56,1120.8,0.24,2.0,Venus.
34570,PS1,3,1121.24,1122.04,0.8,1.0,It's also very hot.
34570,PS1,3,1122.04,1123.48,1.44,1.0,It'll like probably burn there.
34570,PS1,3,1123.48,1124.68,1.2,2.0,Then you want to go back.
34570,PS1,3,1124.68,1126.04,1.36,2.0,So what's After Earth?
34570,PS1,3,1126.04,1126.2,0.16,1.0,Mars.

34570,PS1,3,1130.24,1133.68,3.44,2.0,"Jupiter has made-up of clouds anyway, so it can float in."
34570,PS1,3,1133.68,1136.2,2.52,2.0,The Jupiter ecosystem has 710 moons.
34570,PS1,3,1136.2,1137.84,1.64,2.0,I don't know how many so far.
34570,PS1,3,1138.56,1139.2,0.64,1.0,Why but?
34570,PS1,3,1139.64,1141.52,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, the time travel is going to take a toll."
34570,PS1,3,1141.52,1144.32,2.8,2.0,"We'll have more plastic by that time, So either Venus or Mars."
34570,PS1,3,1144.32,1145.44,1.12,2.0,It has to be Venus or Mars.
34570,PS1,3,1145.56,1146.6,1.04,1.0,I'll just say extra.

34570,PS1,3,1176.08,1177.72,1.64,3.0,Can use our resources.
34570,PS1,3,1177.72,1178.44,0.72,3.0,It's a gift.
34570,PS1,3,1178.8,1181.8,3.0,2.0,"Yeah, but then we could have used our own resources to build the buildings."
34570,PS1,3,1182.08,1186.28,4.2,1.0,"OK, we have one creative idea option, but I like the aliens one as well."
34570,PS1,3,1187.32,1187.44,0.12,1.0,I.
34570,PS1,3,1187.96,1188.8,0.84,2.0,Think this is good?

36449,PS2,6,20.8,28.48,7.68,1.0,Vulnerability within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
36449,PS2,6,28.64,32.84,4.2,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security supply.

36449,PS2,6,38.24,40.64,2.4,3.0,With the creative idea.
36449,PS2,6,43.96,46.52,2.56,1.0,"Say, come up with one creative idea."
36449,PS2,6,46.52,49.08,2.56,3.0,Before the best you bring your address or shoot the best.
36449,PS2,6,50.2,50.64,0.44,2.0,And you can do.
36449,PS2,6,51.2,51.56,0.36,4.0,That yes.
36449,PS2,6,52.88,53.36,0.48,3.0,That is.
36449,PS2,6,54.8,55.68,0.88,5.0,It is a loophole.
36449,PS2,6,59.88,65.4,5.52,1.0,1 is improvement in communication channels and logistics.
36449,PS2,6,66.44,69.04,2.6,4.0,So how do you improve the communication channels and logistics?
36449,PS2,6,69.88,79.03,9.15,1.0,By to improve.

36449,PS2,6,86.79,87.35,0.56,6.0,1 is.
36449,PS2,6,89.23,104.6,15.37,1.0,"Especially with well, it's actually a personalities, personnel involved, good education and this is."
36449,PS2,6,104.8,110.36,5.56,4.0,This is this is basic requirement now for you to work in supply chain app to be educated.
36449,PS2,6,110.48,112.6,2.12,6.0,"Yes, now, but some people don't know what they're doing."
36449,PS2,6,112.6,120.44,7.84,4.0,"So if you are looking for creative ideas, I think we should go with task management platforms."
36449,PS2,6,120.6,123.84,3.24,4.0,We have things just like Slack or Asana.
36449,PS2,6,125.24,128.52,3.28,4.0,"So where yes, the Slack or Asana."
36449,PS2,6,129.6,135.24,5.64,4.0,"So where some of all these, when everything can be checked, you understand."
36449,PS2,6,135.24,145.04,9.8,4.0,"So obona, Obona, if someone someone was assigned a task, once you do it, you document some Asana, all that members will see it."
36449,PS2,6,145.68,146.72,1.04,4.0,I know that this has been.
36449,PS2,6,147.6,147.72,0.12,1.0,Done.
36449,PS2,6,147.72,154.92,7.2,4.0,"Yes, if it has not been done, your team lead or manager or boss can easily see it that this has not been done."
36449,PS2,6,156.52,160.0,3.48,4.0,So someone has not done inventory and it was assigned.
36449,PS2,6,160.6,168.76,8.16,4.0,"So until it until that inventory is done and completed, it will still be flagged on Asana so someone can easily check."
36449,PS2,6,174.2,175.56,1.36,4.0,It's a personal management.
36449,PS2,6,176.2,178.52,2.32,4.0,"It's ACRM personal management suggesting, so you put."
36449,PS2,6,181.32,183.16,1.84,5.0,"It in a In a word, the way it's going."
36449,PS2,6,184.4,185.4,1.0,3.0,To write it so the use of force.
36449,PS2,6,186.76,187.72,0.96,1.0,Task management.
36449,PS2,6,188.16,190.4,2.24,4.0,"Yes, platforms like Asana use asthma."

36284,PS5,3,16.68,17.4,0.72,1.0,Pay them more.
36284,PS5,3,18.72,20.12,1.4,1.0,There's no creativity in that.
36284,PS5,3,21.4,22.48,1.08,1.0,Increase salary.

36284,PS5,3,33.4,35.92,2.52,1.0,"If you're treating them badly and therefore they leave, is that voluntary?"
36284,PS5,3,35.92,36.04,0.12,1.0,Is.
36284,PS5,3,36.04,36.92,0.88,2.0,I'm not sure that's voluntary.
36284,PS5,3,37.24,37.76,0.52,1.0,Voluntary.
36284,PS5,3,37.76,38.88,1.12,1.0,I think voluntary.

36284,PS5,3,54.72,55.76,1.04,2.0,It's fine.
36284,PS5,3,64.36,66.84,2.48,2.0,You could offer incentives to stay.
36284,PS5,3,66.88,67.68,0.8,2.0,What incentives?
36284,PS5,3,68.12,68.52,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36284,PS5,3,69.12,69.8,0.68,2.0,That's not creative.
36284,PS5,3,69.8,70.36,0.56,2.0,I don't want to say.
36284,PS5,3,78.04,81.24,3.2,1.0,"Attrition means just, you know, resigning, right?"
36284,PS5,3,81.32,81.92,0.6,2.0,Yeah.

36284,PS5,3,83.96,84.12,0.16,2.0,Just.
36284,PS5,3,106.24,124.44,18.2,1.0,"SO1 solution would be not breaking the one who resigns back, but creating another mechanism that even if employees are voluntarily resigning, there's no attrition in the workforce so there is some sort of backup."
36284,PS5,3,124.48,127.72,3.24,2.0,"Oh well, but OK."
36284,PS5,3,127.72,132.72,5.0,2.0,"But the, the, the question isn't about how to keep the the company functioning."
36284,PS5,3,132.72,135.48,2.76,2.0,"It's more about how to stop the attrition in the 1st place, right."
36284,PS5,3,135.48,139.36,3.88,1.0,"So it's not like, you know, if you you can't, you can't really solve that just by, you know, getting you make."
36284,PS5,3,139.56,147.56,8.0,3.0,Your voluntarily leave or attrition even harder if you have to finest someone to replace you.
36284,PS5,3,148.08,153.64,5.56,2.0,"Before oh, if you have to find oh, sorry, I thought you meant the company has or you have to personally find 'cause that's interesting, like if you."
36284,PS5,3,153.8,154.12,0.32,1.0,Let's say.
36284,PS5,3,154.12,154.84,0.72,1.0,What does it mean?
36284,PS5,3,154.84,155.88,1.04,1.0,Employee attrition.
36284,PS5,3,156.04,157.16,1.12,1.0,Let's define the term.
36284,PS5,3,160.56,160.96,0.4,1.0,Let's see.
36284,PS5,3,161.84,168.72,6.88,2.0,Mandate find a replacement for themselves.
36284,PS5,3,173.6,174.28,0.68,2.0,Is that a word?
36284,PS5,3,175.56,176.32,0.76,2.0,"Oh, it says it's a word."
36284,PS5,3,176.32,177.2,0.88,2.0,"It's fine, Grammarly."
36284,PS5,3,177.2,177.48,0.28,2.0,Come on.
36284,PS5,3,177.48,179.0,1.52,2.0,Come on.
36284,PS5,3,179.0,179.48,0.48,2.0,"OK, that's fine."
36284,PS5,3,180.8,181.2,0.4,1.0,A trip.
36284,PS5,3,181.6,183.12,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, I have the English."
36284,PS5,3,186.56,186.76,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36284,PS5,3,186.76,187.08,0.32,2.0,So did.
36284,PS5,3,187.08,187.84,0.76,2.0,Did you find something?
36284,PS5,3,187.92,188.44,0.52,2.0,"No, it's just."
36284,PS5,3,188.88,192.32,3.44,1.0,It says even though we cannot use Internet.
36284,PS5,3,192.32,192.92,0.6,2.0,"Oh yeah, that's true."
36284,PS5,3,192.92,193.92,1.0,2.0,Why are you using Internet?
36284,PS5,3,194.44,198.36,3.92,1.0,Voluntary attrition occurs when employees leave a company of their own volition.
36284,PS5,3,198.48,199.0,0.52,1.0,Yeah.
36284,PS5,3,199.0,202.64,3.64,1.0,Employees living voluntarily may indicate that they are problems at the company.
36284,PS5,3,202.64,202.88,0.24,1.0,Yes.
36284,PS5,3,203.16,206.72,3.56,1.0,Or it may mean that people have personal reasons for deploying the business.
36284,PS5,3,207.32,207.44,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36284,PS5,3,213.0,217.04,4.04,2.0,"I would say the 4th 1 is probably the most creative that we have so far, but I don't know, maybe we can do better than that."
36284,PS5,3,222.08,225.56,3.48,1.0,"But this is kind of no, isn't it happening?"
36284,PS5,3,225.8,226.28,0.48,2.0,Which one?
36284,PS5,3,226.8,227.64,0.84,1.0,#4.
36284,PS5,3,227.84,228.04,0.2,2.0,It.
36284,PS5,3,228.48,230.4,1.92,1.0,Depends on the terms that you've signed.
36284,PS5,3,232.68,233.12,0.44,2.0,"Wait, really?"
36284,PS5,3,233.12,235.8,2.68,2.0,Like isn't they can make you find someone to replace you?
36284,PS5,3,235.8,238.4,2.6,2.0,"Like actually, because I didn't know that would be like, good."
36284,PS5,3,242.76,258.56,15.8,1.0,"And if you find someone to replace you that is performing better than you do, you get extra like a bonus, you get a little, you know, compensation for for your good choice."
36284,PS5,3,259.16,260.56,1.4,2.0,But then wait.
36284,PS5,3,261.0,261.16,0.16,2.0,Huh?
36284,PS5,3,261.96,263.08,1.12,2.0,Would that really OK?
36284,PS5,3,263.08,271.44,8.36,2.0,"I'm not sure that would stop because the idea of this is to make it like difficult to a trip because you have to find someone and not not everyone can find any can find someone, right?"
36284,PS5,3,271.76,272.76,1.0,2.0,So then if you have to make it.
36284,PS5,3,272.88,274.28,1.4,1.0,You say they can make it too difficult.
36284,PS5,3,274.52,274.92,0.4,2.0,I'm not sure.
36284,PS5,3,274.96,275.6,0.64,2.0,I'm not well.
36284,PS5,3,278.36,283.4,5.04,2.0,"So you're making it both difficult and easy by saying like, you know, if you find someone better then we'll give you money."
36284,PS5,3,283.4,284.28,0.88,2.0,So that that makes it more.
36284,PS5,3,284.36,287.88,3.52,1.0,"First of all, yes, first of all you need to find someone, right?"
36284,PS5,3,291.0,296.76,5.76,1.0,And this is going to be part of the terms when you sign that you sign when you start working for a company.
36284,PS5,3,297.28,300.56,3.28,1.0,So like you like part of a termination clause.
36284,PS5,3,300.72,325.08,24.36,1.0,"So your contract should have a termination clause that says that if I want to leave my job voluntarily, I need to find replacement and if I find replace a replacement that is considered a high performing replacement by the company, then I am eligible for compensation."
36284,PS5,3,325.12,325.36,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36284,PS5,3,326.76,328.76,2.0,2.0,But don't we want to punish them more?
36284,PS5,3,329.16,330.76,1.6,2.0,Because in this way we want.
36284,PS5,3,330.76,332.48,1.72,1.0,To punish them or we want to encourage them.
36284,PS5,3,332.72,333.16,0.44,2.0,To like.
36284,PS5,3,333.36,335.04,1.68,1.0,Improve the workforce of our.
36284,PS5,3,335.04,335.36,0.32,2.0,Company.
36284,PS5,3,335.36,336.52,1.16,2.0,"Oh, and therefore they won't."
36284,PS5,3,337.12,338.68,1.56,2.0,But that's not they will.
36284,PS5,3,338.68,339.44,0.76,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
36284,PS5,3,339.48,339.8,0.32,2.0,"Well, yeah."
36284,PS5,3,339.92,347.24,7.32,1.0,But the outcome for the company might be OK that we got rid of of an employee and replaced him or her with a better.
36284,PS5,3,347.24,350.48,3.24,2.0,"One, OK, so you're, you're talking the the issue of the reduction of talent."
36284,PS5,3,350.56,353.08,2.52,2.0,"That's what the issue you're tackling, not the directly of the."
36284,PS5,3,353.72,355.4,1.68,1.0,"Yeah, not directly preventing."
36284,PS5,3,355.8,364.96,9.16,2.0,"Attrition aggressor Lee, do you have any alternative ideas?"
36284,PS5,3,364.96,376.0,11.04,2.0,"I don't know, but the and provide, yeah."
36284,PS5,3,376.0,376.4,0.4,1.0,I don't know.
36284,PS5,3,376.4,382.04,5.64,1.0,"Another creative idea is Oh my God, this."
36284,PS5,3,382.08,382.4,0.32,2.0,Is a.
36284,PS5,3,382.76,413.04,30.28,1.0,"This is a disaster to like for the company to strategically employ employees and their partners or their friends so that when they have to voluntarily attract, you know what I mean, they would have to separate from their partner or from."
36284,PS5,3,413.2,416.68,3.48,2.0,Oh they so they in the closet says you have to separate if you is that the OR no?
36284,PS5,3,416.72,420.4,3.68,1.0,"No, no, I'm just saying that, OK, if we are too, we are a couple, OK?"
36284,PS5,3,420.76,421.0,0.24,2.0,Right.
36284,PS5,3,421.12,421.24,0.12,1.0,Right.
36284,PS5,3,421.56,422.28,0.72,1.0,And it's.
36284,PS5,3,422.28,422.92,0.64,2.0,"Very early, but it's."
36284,PS5,3,423.4,423.52,0.12,1.0,Fine.
36284,PS5,3,423.52,424.16,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, I know."
36284,PS5,3,424.36,427.68,3.32,1.0,"And like our, our, our, yeah, I'm interested in that."
36284,PS5,3,427.68,430.64,2.96,1.0,There's a company that has an interest in me to employ me.
36284,PS5,3,431.0,432.52,1.52,1.0,They will employ you as well.
36284,PS5,3,432.6,433.64,1.04,1.0,They will employ me and you.
36284,PS5,3,434.44,438.16,3.72,1.0,"So we are together in the company, which means that it's more, more of a I don't know."
36284,PS5,3,438.2,439.24,1.04,1.0,I don't know if it's suitable.
36284,PS5,3,439.6,441.8,2.2,2.0,"'Cause I mean, I'm not sure if everyone would be put off by that."
36284,PS5,3,441.8,442.8,1.0,2.0,"I feel like it's just like, you know, if."
36284,PS5,3,442.8,443.04,0.24,2.0,Maybe.
36284,PS5,3,443.04,443.6,0.56,1.0,It's a discourse.
36284,PS5,3,443.6,446.32,2.72,1.0,"I don't know, being employed, I don't want to be with my partner, you know?"
36284,PS5,3,447.52,450.84,3.32,2.0,Is there any way to like discourage them further to like for them not to cause?

35501,PS6,3,692.4,695.48,3.08,2.0,"Have to shower head and lights hear some of the shampoo bottle, some of the bottle."
35501,PS6,3,698.24,701.08,2.84,2.0,So you can bet maybe we should have like something about AQR card.
35501,PS6,3,701.08,703.16,2.08,2.0,I don't know how you get a new song every time you use a shampoo bottle.
35501,PS6,3,703.76,709.44,5.68,2.0,Maybe like QR code on the shampoo bottle so you can actually get the music playing in the background shampoo.
35501,PS6,3,711.0,711.08,0.08,3.0,Is.
35501,PS6,3,712.0,716.6,4.6,2.0,"Mike, now we're talking, yes, that's actually, that's a really great, that's actually a good one."
35501,PS6,3,716.6,718.84,2.24,2.0,So that's a good shampoo in a microphone shade.
35217,PS1,6,2.52,2.96,0.44,1.0,How to?
35217,PS1,6,7.84,9.12,1.28,2.0,Reduce plastic pollution.
35217,PS1,6,12.12,15.12,3.0,3.0,Does anyone do like bioscience here?
35217,PS1,6,15.12,15.28,0.16,3.0,No.
35217,PS1,6,18.72,29.44,10.72,2.0,"I mean, if you're trying to reduce plastic pollution, you kind of have to replace whatever's made plastic with something else, like at least like bags and stuff, because you can't eliminate it, is what?"
35217,PS1,6,30.12,37.8,7.68,2.0,"So if you come up with a solution, let's see how we can maybe replace it or kind of get a substitute for it."
35217,PS1,6,39.56,39.96,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, just."
35217,PS1,6,39.96,40.2,0.24,1.0,Just the.
35217,PS1,6,40.2,40.4,0.2,2.0,Top.
35217,PS1,6,41.52,45.6,4.08,1.0,"Must it be like creative, like something that that hasn't been done before or?"
35217,PS1,6,46.36,46.6,0.24,2.0,OK.
35217,PS1,6,48.4,49.48,1.08,4.0,Like the general?
35217,PS1,6,49.48,50.72,1.24,3.0,Principles for reduce.
35217,PS1,6,51.24,57.2,5.96,4.0,Like waste would be like reduce reuse for cycle but like we just have to make that look creative.
35217,PS1,6,58.72,58.96,0.24,2.0,OK.
35217,PS1,6,76.04,82.0,5.96,3.0,"OK, So what already exists there's like paper paper straws like replacing."
35217,PS1,6,82.56,84.28,1.72,2.0,There's there's like clock bags.
35217,PS1,6,85.16,87.4,2.24,3.0,"Yeah, and there's charging for."
35217,PS1,6,87.4,87.96,0.56,1.0,Plastic.
35217,PS1,6,91.68,97.16,5.48,2.0,"You get paid back in certain countries, like for example in Germany, if you give your plastic bottle back."
35217,PS1,6,97.2,97.88,0.68,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,97.88,98.04,0.16,3.0,So.
35217,PS1,6,98.04,100.2,2.16,2.0,You get like .5 EUR .25.
35217,PS1,6,100.68,102.04,1.36,3.0,It's making them easier to recycle.
35217,PS1,6,102.04,106.32,4.28,3.0,"So like putting those like, you know how they attach the caps to Coke's now?"
35217,PS1,6,106.36,107.88,1.52,3.0,"Yeah, does that."
35217,PS1,6,109.04,109.36,0.32,2.0,OK.
35217,PS1,6,109.4,117.44,8.04,2.0,"So I guess, I guess from in our solution, what we can look at is if firstly, if we can replace plastic somewhere, then we should do that."
35217,PS1,6,117.44,127.56,10.12,2.0,"And if we can't replace it somewhere, then we should make sure it gets recycled or like it comes back and gets reused in some form or the other so you're not generating anymore."
35217,PS1,6,130.48,133.52,3.04,2.0,So I don't know just as you come up with a creative idea that does that.
35217,PS1,6,136.28,143.92,7.64,4.0,"I guess maybe the creative part could be how we encourage people to do that, like the incentives as you mentioned, like you get something in return."
35217,PS1,6,143.92,146.88,2.96,4.0,It's like how to get people to do it?
35217,PS1,6,147.56,147.76,0.2,2.0,OK.
35217,PS1,6,149.6,151.64,2.04,2.0,So an incentive or could be money.
35217,PS1,6,152.4,152.8,0.4,2.0,Sorry the brush.
35217,PS1,6,157.08,158.56,1.48,5.0,"Is good, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,159.72,161.08,1.36,2.0,Hands down so.
35217,PS1,6,161.36,165.88,4.52,1.0,"I was thinking like, you know, like how beach cleanups and like the way the amount of fun stuff you."
35217,PS1,6,165.92,166.24,0.32,6.0,"Would, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,166.68,168.16,1.48,1.0,You would pick up from the beach.
35217,PS1,6,168.16,169.2,1.04,2.0,And you get money proposed.
35217,PS1,6,169.24,172.72,3.48,1.0,Like any like you can set up a centre and like anyone can just like bring.
35217,PS1,6,173.2,173.48,0.28,2.0,Like.
35217,PS1,6,173.96,174.88,0.92,1.0,Plastic waste.
35217,PS1,6,175.76,175.88,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35217,PS1,6,175.88,177.08,1.2,2.0,"And any kind of waste, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,177.32,181.28,3.96,1.0,"And you can, because this is pollution."
35217,PS1,6,181.28,186.8,5.52,1.0,"So, yeah, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,186.8,187.88,1.08,2.0,That's actually a good idea.
35217,PS1,6,187.88,199.32,11.44,2.0,"Like you can kind of have these not exactly a store, but like a setup where somebody can come up with their plastic waste, like how you segregate organic and inorganic waste or something like that."
35217,PS1,6,199.72,215.64,15.92,2.0,"And then for the amount you bring in, it's weight and you get some money for and then that is sent for recycling or or if you can reuse the product and then so that I guess takes part of not producing extra plastic again and again."
35217,PS1,6,215.64,220.48,4.84,2.0,"But the problem is not, I mean reducing plastic as well."
35217,PS1,6,222.16,224.36,2.2,2.0,So how do we reduce the pollution?
35217,PS1,6,229.32,239.72,10.4,6.0,"Like the magnetic strips on the accounts to like that stop like instead of using like the plastic rings that that's just like, you know, like stuff like that."
35217,PS1,6,260.24,263.72,3.48,3.0,"There's obviously lots of solutions, but none of them were creative I."
35217,PS1,6,282.23,283.19,0.96,6.0,Feel like that AI is probably.
35217,PS1,6,285.75,286.27,0.52,2.0,"Yeah, probably."
35217,PS1,6,289.99,294.43,4.44,3.0,I feel like the like rubbish free like trend.
35217,PS1,6,299.79,310.08,10.29,3.0,"I don't know, I feel like that's quite a big thing when you see people who have just like a little like Mason jar full of like, well, they're rubbish of the year, which I think is extreme, obviously suggesting that."
35217,PS1,6,310.36,331.92,21.56,3.0,"But I think if you, if you, if you started making it be like you actually have to face your plastic consumption for the whole year at the end of it, like a like a Spotify Wrapped, but for your, like your, your load."
35217,PS1,6,332.04,350.72,18.68,2.0,"You can make it like a a social media competition kind of something that right where you can post it like how you post your Spotify that maybe something along that where you can kind of show off that you've recycled this much and you get some benefit, maybe like lesser taxes, better interest on your loan."
35217,PS1,6,350.76,352.16,1.4,2.0,I don't know something that would be.
35217,PS1,6,352.88,355.92,3.04,3.0,And then also the.
35217,PS1,6,356.44,357.04,0.6,4.0,Apparently.
35217,PS1,6,357.8,369.88,12.08,3.0,"This is a rumour I've heard they if you're if one person on the street has like wet recycling or like recycling that is like not done properly, they just like bin the whole streets recycling."
35217,PS1,6,369.88,371.0,1.12,3.0,I think that's the days in London.
35217,PS1,6,371.2,385.2,14.0,3.0,"So like you probably it might not be that every individual has to do it, but like if there could be a bigger stat about how much recycling actually isn't recycled in the UK, that would be probably quite a good information campaign."
35217,PS1,6,386.2,386.8,0.6,3.0,I don't know.
35217,PS1,6,388.12,389.12,1.0,3.0,"Again, not recreate."
35217,PS1,6,391.56,391.64,0.08,4.0,We.
35217,PS1,6,392.0,392.24,0.24,3.0,Have to.
35217,PS1,6,392.32,393.32,1.0,1.0,"I think, I think we should."
35217,PS1,6,393.48,396.84,3.36,1.0,I think we can roll with that because we might just come up with a brilliant idea.
35217,PS1,6,396.84,397.36,0.52,1.0,Let's roll with.
35217,PS1,6,401.28,402.24,0.96,5.0,That what should I tell you said.
35217,PS1,6,402.32,402.48,0.16,2.0,About.
35217,PS1,6,402.52,405.16,2.64,6.0,"Like the plastic, like your plastic waste."
35217,PS1,6,405.68,409.76,4.08,6.0,You could like make like a collar or something like that.
35217,PS1,6,409.76,410.04,0.28,6.0,Creative.
35217,PS1,6,410.88,411.12,0.24,6.0,I don't.
35217,PS1,6,413.68,418.24,4.56,5.0,Know OK so what's the idea we.
35217,PS1,6,418.96,420.44,1.48,2.0,Suppose the following solution that.
35217,PS1,6,420.76,422.68,1.92,5.0,I didn't think we need to write it.
35217,PS1,6,423.44,425.68,2.24,5.0,"Write the solution, I think not like an essay."
35217,PS1,6,428.88,429.2,0.32,5.0,Yeah.
35217,PS1,6,429.2,433.48,4.28,5.0,So like like to create some system that people.
35217,PS1,6,433.72,434.92,1.2,2.0,"Would recycle, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,435.0,441.84,6.84,2.0,We want to create a system I can that where people would resell would be incentivized to probably recycle or reuse plastic.
35217,PS1,6,442.4,447.56,5.16,2.0,So the lesser plastic they buy that gets dragged from any store.
35217,PS1,6,448.24,449.04,0.8,2.0,If that's possible.
35217,PS1,6,449.76,454.52,4.76,2.0,"Like every time you like build an item, the amount of plastic that's associated with it comes into play."
35217,PS1,6,455.68,461.04,5.36,2.0,So that will include like bags all the way to that what the item contain.
35217,PS1,6,465.56,472.2,6.64,2.0,And then you can also add more points by each time you recycle something else.
35217,PS1,6,473.4,477.36,3.96,2.0,"And this could add on to like how you have a credit score, you could have like environment score."
35217,PS1,6,478.32,478.64,0.32,1.0,OK.
35217,PS1,6,479.64,485.2,5.56,3.0,And also you could use those points to like buy multi use things.
35217,PS1,6,485.64,494.56,8.92,3.0,So like you use your points to get like a free water bottle or like a free tote bag depending on what you've got.
35217,PS1,6,495.68,497.76,2.08,1.0,So should we go with environmental score?
35217,PS1,6,498.0,500.16,2.16,2.0,"Yeah, sure, you can make like an environmental score like."
35217,PS1,6,503.32,503.56,0.24,5.0,OK.
35217,PS1,6,506.2,511.68,5.48,4.0,Might be a bit extreme but like because you've mentioned credit score but like how people sort.
35217,PS1,6,511.68,512.88,1.2,3.0,Of be penalised.
35217,PS1,6,513.56,514.32,0.76,2.0,"I mean, this one's a."
35217,PS1,6,514.76,517.84,3.08,2.0,It could affect your rate of interest in the bank as well.
35217,PS1,6,517.88,520.76,2.88,2.0,Like you cannot if you're not being environmentally friendly.
35217,PS1,6,520.88,521.76,0.88,2.0,Higher rates than.
35217,PS1,6,522.6,525.2,2.6,5.0,It absolutely it would not be popular.
35217,PS1,6,526.2,526.88,0.68,2.0,But it would.
35217,PS1,6,527.84,528.48,0.64,5.0,I would say it's.
35217,PS1,6,528.48,529.2,0.72,2.0,More smaller.
35217,PS1,6,530.04,536.64,6.6,5.0,"Yeah, I would say it's more like a, for instance, you get charged less for waste management."
35217,PS1,6,537.84,538.2,0.36,2.0,Like I mean.
35217,PS1,6,538.88,550.68,11.8,5.0,"Like based on that, like if you let's say have AI don't know 50K per year or two 100K per year, you you pay your like rubbish fee accordingly."
35217,PS1,6,551.52,561.72,10.2,2.0,"But then that's the one time which it should kind of affect your lifestyle and that should be like a more important decision, like a car or a house that actually in fact take 200 lbs."
35217,PS1,6,561.72,568.36,6.64,2.0,"Once is OK, but then if it's on something like 200,000 LB house then there's a problem."
35217,PS1,6,569.48,572.04,2.56,3.0,Then that could raise you become like discriminatory.
35217,PS1,6,572.12,573.68,1.56,2.0,But that's like credit score already.
35217,PS1,6,573.76,574.16,0.4,1.0,Yeah.
35217,PS1,6,574.36,575.32,0.96,2.0,"If it exists, fine."
35217,PS1,6,575.4,584.56,9.16,3.0,"True, but like richer families could would already have like everything, everything they might have like beeswax paper and like that kind of stuff and then like."
35217,PS1,6,585.08,585.56,0.48,2.0,"You know, yeah, fair."
35217,PS1,6,585.76,585.96,0.2,2.0,Then.
35217,PS1,6,585.96,594.8,8.84,2.0,"Then it I think it's on the government to make those things like to encourage companies to not use plastic because anyways, people stopped buying their items in the long term."
35217,PS1,6,597.08,598.6,1.52,4.0,"Yeah, we stopped the production."
35217,PS1,6,599.08,599.28,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35217,PS1,6,599.56,605.2,5.64,2.0,"So like penalized companies as well, like the the their score goes lower, so they have to pay more."
35217,PS1,6,606.48,606.6,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35217,PS1,6,606.6,607.04,0.44,2.0,And they are.
35217,PS1,6,607.08,610.56,3.48,2.0,They're incentivized to make things without blasting.
35217,PS1,6,611.16,612.0,0.84,5.0,"OK, we'll do it right I."
35217,PS1,6,615.12,615.44,0.32,4.0,Need that.
35217,PS1,6,615.44,615.8,0.36,3.0,I can.
35217,PS1,6,616.84,617.56,0.72,2.0,You want me to type?
35217,PS1,6,619.36,619.84,0.48,1.0,I mean you.
35217,PS1,6,619.84,623.36,3.52,2.0,"Can, Yeah, Come on."
35217,PS1,6,623.36,624.32,0.96,2.0,"If I want that, yeah."
35217,PS1,6,625.52,626.48,0.96,3.0,Maybe give it to Drew?
35217,PS1,6,632.08,632.64,0.56,2.0,That's a mistake.
35217,PS1,6,637.04,642.0,4.96,3.0,It also doesn't really matter about the answer because they have recorded the recording.
35217,PS1,6,642.16,643.96,1.8,3.0,"Yeah, that's what that is."
35217,PS1,6,661.48,663.96,2.48,4.0,It's hard to be creative when someone asks you to be creative.
35217,PS1,6,664.92,666.36,1.44,2.0,It's a pretty classic process.
35217,PS1,6,666.8,671.56,4.76,3.0,"And also about things that aren't like, don't really need a creative solution."
35217,PS1,6,701.8,702.32,0.52,2.0,Then what?
35249,PS5,3,3.12,3.52,0.4,1.0,Voluntary.
35249,PS5,3,3.52,3.96,0.44,2.0,Attrition we.

35249,PS5,3,9.24,10.6,1.36,3.0,There's nothing in the reduction.
35249,PS5,3,10.68,12.48,1.8,2.0,Of very talent in the whole.
35249,PS5,3,15.0,15.28,0.28,1.0,Place the.
35249,PS5,3,17.6,20.0,2.4,2.0,Voluntary and very attrition.
35249,PS5,3,21.28,23.16,1.88,3.0,Just like they live on their own.
35249,PS5,3,24.16,25.24,1.08,2.0,What is attrition?
35249,PS5,3,25.88,28.84,2.96,1.0,I will search for you attrition.
35249,PS5,3,29.24,29.8,0.56,2.0,Monetary.
35249,PS5,3,29.88,32.4,2.52,1.0,Attrition the.
35249,PS5,3,35.04,36.24,1.2,2.0,Employee decide to leave the.
35249,PS5,3,37.24,37.84,0.6,1.0,Company.
35249,PS5,3,39.48,44.96,5.48,1.0,Maybe the people leave the company.
35249,PS5,3,45.76,48.2,2.44,1.0,"Yes, people leave the company."
35249,PS5,3,48.92,49.88,0.96,2.0,Or attrition.
35249,PS5,3,50.52,50.72,0.2,3.0,Yes.
35249,PS5,3,50.8,51.72,0.92,3.0,So do you believe the?
35249,PS5,3,51.84,63.2,11.36,2.0,Company Stop voluntary employee attrition in a company.
35249,PS5,3,65.24,68.32,3.08,3.0,"So how do you convince people not to leave the company, basically?"
35249,PS5,3,70.2,72.76,2.56,1.0,It concerns about.
35249,PS5,3,73.0,74.04,1.04,2.0,Increase the salary.
35249,PS5,3,74.96,75.56,0.6,3.0,Who was?
35249,PS5,3,75.72,80.4,4.68,1.0,The employee indeed need requirement when they in the company.
35249,PS5,3,81.16,81.6,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,82.04,83.28,1.24,1.0,Why they want to leave?
35249,PS5,3,85.48,87.12,1.64,2.0,It doesn't need to be noble it.
35249,PS5,3,89.68,90.76,1.08,3.0,Has to be creative.
35249,PS5,3,91.28,93.2,1.92,1.0,So I.
35249,PS5,3,93.24,93.4,0.16,3.0,Mean.
35249,PS5,3,93.4,95.56,2.16,3.0,The obvious one is increased salary.
35249,PS5,3,95.88,97.36,1.48,1.0,Increased salary as well.
35249,PS5,3,97.76,98.64,0.88,1.0,Good idea.
35249,PS5,3,98.96,100.96,2.0,3.0,"Yeah, give additional benefits."
35249,PS5,3,101.16,109.64,8.48,1.0,"Yes, additional benefits or more authority when they are in the working system, yeah."
35249,PS5,3,111.44,113.12,1.68,3.0,Better working hours maybe?
35249,PS5,3,114.08,114.48,0.4,1.0,Yes.
35249,PS5,3,117.56,118.56,1.0,3.0,It has to be created though.
35249,PS5,3,118.64,122.08,3.44,1.0,"We need to write the words here, yeah."
35249,PS5,3,124.12,124.44,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,124.84,125.24,0.4,1.0,Maybe.
35249,PS5,3,126.04,128.52,2.48,3.0,But we need to come up with one creative idea.
35249,PS5,3,128.96,129.64,0.68,1.0,Just one.
35249,PS5,3,129.76,130.2,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,130.24,133.24,3.0,3.0,So we have to choose and it has to be creative.
35249,PS5,3,133.24,136.36,3.12,3.0,"So I I don't think anyone, anything we have said is very creative."
35249,PS5,3,144.36,148.24,3.88,2.0,"Oh, maybe increase the salary based on the working time?"
35249,PS5,3,149.48,149.8,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,150.28,150.96,0.68,1.0,But some.
35249,PS5,3,151.92,160.4,8.48,2.0,Like the the longer you stay in the company the the higher the salary the the basic salary you will get.
35249,PS5,3,161.4,165.76,4.36,1.0,But it will mix a very bad situation.
35249,PS5,3,166.48,172.16,5.68,1.0,"If it only depends on the working time, people will be hard."
35249,PS5,3,172.4,177.28,4.88,2.0,A kind of the basic salary you could have other.
35249,PS5,3,178.0,181.92,3.92,3.0,That could work because that would encourage people to not quit and work.
35249,PS5,3,182.12,184.2,2.08,1.0,"Yes, long it will be tired and it's."
35249,PS5,3,184.2,193.96,9.76,2.0,"Just a basic part, if you work hard harder than others you can get other bonus."
35249,PS5,3,194.92,196.88,1.96,1.0,How to define the bonus?
35249,PS5,3,197.16,199.12,1.96,1.0,How to evaluate the bonus?
35249,PS5,3,200.08,202.8,2.72,2.0,The bonus decided on what's.
35249,PS5,3,203.12,203.84,0.72,3.0,Experience.
35249,PS5,3,204.16,208.0,3.84,2.0,Contribution What you contribute?
35249,PS5,3,208.2,209.32,1.12,1.0,To your performance.
35249,PS5,3,209.44,216.4,6.96,2.0,"The company, but the basic salary depends on the how long you stay in the company."
35249,PS5,3,216.92,220.56,3.64,1.0,"Yes, that's a a proper idea."
35249,PS5,3,221.04,228.8,7.76,3.0,Or we can make the bonus based on the experience.
35249,PS5,3,229.48,231.28,1.8,1.0,Bonus based on the pouch.
35249,PS5,3,231.52,234.04,2.52,3.0,So the base pay is the same for everyone?
35249,PS5,3,234.44,237.68,3.24,3.0,"I mean it, it depends on the seniority level obviously."
35249,PS5,3,238.6,243.56,4.96,3.0,And then there's a extra bonus depending on how long you've worked.
35249,PS5,3,244.8,246.8,2.0,1.0,Bonus depends on how long you work.
35249,PS5,3,246.88,253.16,6.28,1.0,"Yeah, but how long is not represent the experience?"
35249,PS5,3,253.8,263.76,9.96,3.0,"Yeah, I mean in years like 10 years, 10 years, someone was stayed in a company for 10 years, they can get maybe £10,000 someone was."
35249,PS5,3,264.52,269.32,4.8,2.0,Also they they could get an additional travel a journey.
35249,PS5,3,269.72,270.28,0.56,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,270.72,274.8,4.08,2.0,Like a present to the experienced.
35249,PS5,3,275.24,283.28,8.04,1.0,"That makes they can have a chosable bonus, not only one fixed bonus."
35249,PS5,3,284.16,284.48,0.32,2.0,Maybe.
35249,PS5,3,284.64,286.28,1.64,2.0,"Maybe money, maybe a trip."
35249,PS5,3,286.56,287.04,0.48,1.0,Yes.
35249,PS5,3,287.44,290.76,3.32,3.0,"But see, if you give them money they can do they can go on a trip."
35249,PS5,3,291.2,292.4,1.2,1.0,But they don't have time.
35249,PS5,3,293.12,293.64,0.52,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,294.2,298.32,4.12,3.0,"Oh, so you mean like days off from the office?"
35249,PS5,3,299.56,300.08,0.52,3.0,That could work.
35249,PS5,3,300.08,303.48,3.4,3.0,"Yeah, but."
35249,PS5,3,305.08,306.16,1.08,2.0,We could write it.
35249,PS5,3,306.4,307.16,0.76,3.0,That very first.
35249,PS5,3,307.16,307.68,0.52,3.0,Maybe you can maybe.
35249,PS5,3,311.48,312.88,1.4,1.0,The first is a base.
35249,PS5,3,313.0,317.24,4.24,2.0,I think what you said is also helpful.
35249,PS5,3,317.24,339.44,22.2,2.0,We we we could this could be a plan combines different aspects like first first part maybe we could ask why they want to leave and offers personalized plan for for different people.
35249,PS5,3,339.52,342.76,3.24,1.0,To do more customized solution.
35249,PS5,3,342.76,346.88,4.12,2.0,"Yeah, Yeah, this is, yeah, this is the first part."
35249,PS5,3,346.88,365.2,18.32,2.0,"And on the other hand, we could also offer some bonus for the the people who stay longer in the company, like like money, like trip."
35249,PS5,3,366.12,374.16,8.04,3.0,And it could be that the bonus increases exponentially depending on the years in the company.
35249,PS5,3,375.56,384.52,8.96,1.0,The base salary is depended on their year.
35249,PS5,3,385.44,387.0,1.56,3.0,Base or bonus?
35249,PS5,3,388.6,390.2,1.6,1.0,Base are just bonus.
35249,PS5,3,390.48,393.36,2.88,3.0,I mean it doesn't really matter just you can just say salary.
35249,PS5,3,393.92,394.32,0.4,1.0,Yes.
35249,PS5,3,396.08,397.52,1.44,3.0,Like we don't have the right base.
35249,PS5,3,398.84,401.08,2.24,2.0,Maybe we could just say bonus.
35249,PS5,3,401.36,402.36,1.0,1.0,Just say bonus.
35249,PS5,3,402.44,402.8,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,405.0,406.8,1.8,1.0,And we have different.
35249,PS5,3,409.52,419.72,10.2,3.0,Addition addition bonus that increases like exponentially or not even exponentially like.
35249,PS5,3,424.16,427.64,3.48,1.0,Contains different ways.
35249,PS5,3,428.48,435.76,7.28,3.0,Making choices you can say additional bonus that depends on years in the company.
35249,PS5,3,436.2,438.48,2.28,1.0,Years working years.
35249,PS5,3,438.48,445.88,7.4,3.0,"Yeah, working years in company and this could be in the form of money, blah, blah, blah."
35249,PS5,3,449.72,449.8,0.08,2.0,You.
35249,PS5,3,450.68,451.12,0.44,1.0,Could write.
35249,PS5,3,451.24,452.24,1.0,1.0,Yes you could.
35249,PS5,3,453.44,453.56,0.12,2.0,Write.
35249,PS5,3,454.4,471.32,16.92,1.0,"Yes, or chips."
35249,PS5,3,474.72,475.44,0.72,3.0,Vacation.
35249,PS5,3,475.44,476.4,0.96,1.0,Or non cash.
35249,PS5,3,477.92,478.84,0.92,1.0,Non cash.
35249,PS5,3,480.24,486.68,6.44,3.0,"Oh yeah, So like asset trips stocks, maybe you can give stocks as?"
35249,PS5,3,488.56,489.52,0.96,1.0,Well or other.
35249,PS5,3,489.68,490.28,0.6,2.0,Vouchers or.
35249,PS5,3,491.72,491.92,0.2,1.0,Others.
35249,PS5,3,492.04,493.32,1.28,3.0,Will do that.
35249,PS5,3,493.32,494.32,1.0,3.0,Won't get a lot of money.
35249,PS5,3,496.08,500.64,4.56,3.0,"Money, stocks, Vacation days."
35249,PS5,3,501.44,502.44,1.0,1.0,Vacation days.
35249,PS5,3,503.8,504.2,0.4,1.0,That's it for.
35249,PS5,3,509.44,513.36,3.92,2.0,"Yeah, and we can, we could expand the 1st."
35249,PS5,3,515.16,515.68,0.52,3.0,Additional.
35249,PS5,3,516.12,518.6,2.48,2.0,Custom solution towards yeah.
35249,PS5,3,519.48,522.28,2.8,3.0,But the problem is we need to come up with only one query of ideas.
35249,PS5,3,522.28,523.72,1.44,3.0,We need to choose this anyway.
35249,PS5,3,524.92,525.72,0.8,2.0,This could be 1.
35249,PS5,3,525.72,528.24,2.52,2.0,I think this could be one idea.
35249,PS5,3,528.84,529.72,0.88,3.0,"All of this, Yeah."
35249,PS5,3,532.84,540.2,7.36,3.0,"OK, wait, so maybe we can incorporate this one into this?"
35249,PS5,3,540.2,540.44,0.24,1.0,Yes.
35249,PS5,3,541.44,545.8,4.36,3.0,"So whether they get money, stocks, vacation days, that will depend on what they want, yes."
35249,PS5,3,546.36,546.88,0.52,2.0,But what?
35249,PS5,3,547.88,548.76,0.88,3.0,We can combine them.
35249,PS5,3,549.6,559.8,10.2,2.0,"The reason they want to leave the company, maybe it's not because the bonus, maybe because the environment, the the opportunities they get."
35249,PS5,3,560.6,564.52,3.92,3.0,"That is true, but we can't solve anything everything with one solution."
35249,PS5,3,564.56,564.88,0.32,1.0,I think.
35249,PS5,3,565.2,565.72,0.52,2.0,It can be.
35249,PS5,3,566.36,567.4,1.04,3.0,With this one one.
35249,PS5,3,567.48,567.68,0.2,2.0,1
35249,PS5,3,568.4,572.72,4.32,1.0,Just one customized solution including additional bonus blah blah and.
35249,PS5,3,573.16,573.88,0.72,2.0,Other method.
35249,PS5,3,576.36,584.72,8.36,1.0,"Or maybe we can have a warmer atmosphere, working working atmosphere or good leader or other."
35249,PS5,3,585.12,587.8,2.68,3.0,"Yeah, but it says one creative idea, that's what's."
35249,PS5,3,587.8,590.44,2.64,1.0,"You know, OK, maybe we can just choose this one."
35249,PS5,3,590.92,591.08,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
35249,PS5,3,591.08,593.16,2.08,3.0,"I mean, we have to choose at some point because."
35249,PS5,3,594.96,598.08,3.12,2.0,I think 1 is not too specific.
35249,PS5,3,598.92,599.48,0.56,3.0,This one.
35249,PS5,3,600.12,602.16,2.04,1.0,She means 1 is not only Yeah we.
35249,PS5,3,602.2,604.0,1.8,2.0,We we could include this.
35249,PS5,3,605.48,608.88,3.4,1.0,"Yeah, a complete or more like."
35249,PS5,3,608.88,619.0,10.12,2.0,We we could set up an an an ominous advice box for the employees like.
35249,PS5,3,619.04,619.48,0.44,3.0,Feedback.
35249,PS5,3,619.6,620.16,0.56,1.0,To choose.
35249,PS5,3,621.52,634.0,12.48,2.0,"No, they they could, they could, they could say their what, what they want, what they need."
35249,PS5,3,634.0,636.16,2.16,1.0,They have a feedback channel.
35249,PS5,3,636.44,637.44,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35249,PS5,3,638.28,638.72,0.44,1.0,At any.
35249,PS5,3,638.72,639.12,0.4,2.0,Time.
35249,PS5,3,639.8,644.08,4.28,3.0,"Yeah, but that does happen and it's not very creative, is it?"
35249,PS5,3,645.68,646.68,1.0,2.0,It's not creative.
35249,PS5,3,647.64,656.76,9.12,3.0,"I mean, it's, I mean, we can come up with like a million solutions or problems, but we only need to choose one."
35249,PS5,3,657.2,659.28,2.08,1.0,We think it's the most creative.
35249,PS5,3,659.44,660.36,0.92,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35249,PS5,3,660.44,664.88,4.44,1.0,So you think the bonus is the most creative among these ideas?
35249,PS5,3,666.4,666.72,0.32,1.0,Yes.
35249,PS5,3,667.52,668.0,0.48,2.0,The bonus?
35249,PS5,3,668.04,669.2,1.16,3.0,Is among our creative.
35249,PS5,3,669.52,671.16,1.64,3.0,It's not creative at all.
35249,PS5,3,671.16,673.28,2.12,3.0,But we have not been able to come.
35249,PS5,3,673.32,673.72,0.4,2.0,We have.

35249,PS5,3,675.04,675.8,0.76,3.0,Idea of time.
35249,PS5,3,676.08,677.28,1.2,1.0,"Yes, we have no time."
35249,PS5,3,677.4,678.24,0.84,1.0,Maybe that's.
35249,PS5,3,678.64,678.88,0.24,3.0,That's.
35249,PS5,3,678.96,679.36,0.4,1.0,OK.
35249,PS5,3,680.72,683.4,2.68,2.0,We could also add you can add something.

36388,PS4,3,1.16,2.68,1.52,1.0,"But it's 12 minutes each, OK?"
36388,PS4,3,3.08,10.76,7.68,1.0,Educational inequality is the unusual distribution of academic resources to disadvantaged and marginalised groups.
36388,PS4,3,11.08,16.12,5.04,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to overcome inequality in education.
36388,PS4,3,22.08,23.88,1.8,1.0,Inequality of education.
36388,PS4,3,38.68,42.72,4.04,2.0,"Well, something in terms of like progression to university."
36388,PS4,3,43.16,50.24,7.08,2.0,"I know like in the English system, it's like you apply there are like universities of prestigious and like you applied like your favourites and stuff."
36388,PS4,3,50.24,51.0,0.76,2.0,But then so I did.
36388,PS4,3,51.0,52.2,1.2,2.0,I studied French as an undergrad.
36388,PS4,3,52.2,68.96,16.76,2.0,"The way you were born in France and how it works there is you get sent to more completely random, which I was like, oh, that's really weird because well, if you don't want to go, but also it's like less, there's less of that inequality because it's like all different like levels and like people from different places are represented and like institution."
36388,PS4,3,69.44,82.12,12.68,2.0,"So that's something it's like make it more randomized, like less sort of streaming based on ability, because a lot of that is like determined by like your family background and."
36388,PS4,3,82.6,84.24,1.64,3.0,This is a very difficult I've had.
36388,PS4,3,87.36,88.72,1.36,1.0,"No, that is a good one."
36388,PS4,3,93.32,93.48,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
36388,PS4,3,93.76,96.84,3.08,1.0,"I mean, it's just, it's like a lottery system, isn't it?"
36388,PS4,3,98.72,104.08,5.36,1.0,So I mean I can start writing like lottery.
36388,PS4,3,111.08,112.8,1.72,2.0,"Yeah, that is only like higher education."
36388,PS4,3,113.28,114.24,0.96,1.0,Like your place?
36388,PS4,3,114.32,115.32,1.0,2.0,Primary and secondary.
36388,PS4,3,118.84,125.04,6.2,1.0,Randomly into a school slash university.
36388,PS4,3,126.0,146.56,20.56,1.0,"But then what if it depends on like, and then maybe like because like I'm thinking of like logistically if you're from like New Zealand like me and with if I'm distributed to like USA or something, then I guess like the government needs to pay for you to go."
36388,PS4,3,146.56,147.92,1.36,2.0,There I feel like it only.
36388,PS4,3,147.92,148.68,0.76,1.0,You cannot.
36388,PS4,3,148.88,149.8,0.92,2.0,"No, no, exactly."
36388,PS4,3,150.28,152.4,2.12,2.0,Like maybe within the country it's easier.
36388,PS4,3,152.8,161.8,9.0,2.0,"But then there is the issue of like, yeah, if you're, if you want to stay where you are, if that's like the easiest thing for you, like literally in your city and then you get sent somewhere far away."
36388,PS4,3,161.8,162.04,0.24,2.0,That's the.
36388,PS4,3,163.04,163.32,0.28,1.0,Problem.
36388,PS4,3,163.32,179.92,16.6,1.0,"But like, yeah, but I'm thinking, you know, like US has amazing schools, so would it be fair for someone to choose they will just want to stay in the US because they've got a higher chance of more prestigious education compared to someone in New Zealand."
36388,PS4,3,180.84,190.84,10.0,1.0,"So like how, Yeah, I'm just like thinking, how can we, like, counteract that university?"
36388,PS4,3,194.52,196.48,1.96,1.0,"I mean, this doesn't have to be feasible."
36388,PS4,3,197.2,200.76,3.56,1.0,Paid for your education.
36388,PS4,3,201.36,205.88,4.52,1.0,Slash flights wherever you are.
36388,PS4,3,206.6,207.96,1.36,2.0,Placed noise.
36388,PS4,3,208.88,209.92,1.04,3.0,"Oh, that would be very nice."
36388,PS4,3,210.12,211.84,1.72,1.0,It would be if that's we.
36388,PS4,3,211.84,214.32,2.48,1.0,"If that's what you want, then."
36388,PS4,3,214.4,241.76,27.36,3.0,"Probably probably I think them encourage encourage kind of they you know, they encourage more, you know, transforming of you know, the resources to the disadvantage for groups like like you know, shell, you know, shell some connection or you know some online teaching or you know from the."
36388,PS4,3,245.08,251.4,6.32,1.0,How can we distribute resources better to marginalized groups?
36388,PS4,3,253.36,257.2,3.84,1.0,"I think 'cause I think that's where the inequality is, right?"
36388,PS4,3,257.2,262.32,5.12,1.0,"Like at least in this question, it's it's the resources they don't have what?"
36388,PS4,3,262.68,269.84,7.16,2.0,"Yeah, I guess something the government could incentivize teachers to work in like disadvantaged areas."
36388,PS4,3,269.84,276.76,6.92,2.0,So then they get like the the talent like media qualified teachers or teachers from like who have like had an education and like.
36388,PS4,3,276.84,282.24,5.4,3.0,Education probably encourage the talent teachers yeah work for the but.
36388,PS4,3,282.4,284.04,1.64,1.0,But what if it's the resources?
36388,PS4,3,284.04,287.88,3.84,1.0,Like they don't have computers or they don't have like pens and pencils?
36388,PS4,3,287.88,291.04,3.16,1.0,"It's not something the teacher can solve, even if they're."
36388,PS4,3,291.04,292.2,1.16,2.0,"Like funding, isn't it?"
36388,PS4,3,292.24,292.52,0.28,2.0,Yes.
36388,PS4,3,292.56,293.04,0.48,1.0,Exactly.
36388,PS4,3,293.04,293.16,0.12,1.0,It's.
36388,PS4,3,293.16,298.56,5.4,3.0,So probably still have the funding specific fundings for the.
36388,PS4,3,300.28,307.84,7.56,1.0,So it's like the governments need to provide more funding to those schools that don't have the resources.
36388,PS4,3,308.0,315.56,7.56,2.0,"So I guess it's like make funding for like the education department, make it like variable depending on like the area, like the post code."
36388,PS4,3,316.56,323.28,6.72,2.0,"And in disadvantaged areas, I guess the education gets more, the counselling gets more money into education and buy computers and things."
36388,PS4,3,325.32,326.48,1.16,3.0,We don't have much time now.
36388,PS4,3,326.48,327.48,1.0,1.0,6 minutes is OK.
36388,PS4,3,327.68,328.24,0.56,2.0,That's fine.
36388,PS4,3,328.4,335.16,6.76,1.0,Make funding more available to marginalised areas of net groups.
36388,PS4,3,339.04,354.0,14.96,2.0,"Also have maybe have like like partnership programs between say like high achieving, like private schools and like state schools and kind of things like students like like mentoring programs and also like universities."
36388,PS4,3,354.04,356.4,2.36,2.0,"I mean, Cambridge, not Cambridge, not actually quite good at this."
36388,PS4,3,356.4,365.84,9.44,2.0,So having people like having schools come to visit and having like staff and students like go to schools and stuff to sort of inspire students.
36388,PS4,3,370.44,394.56,24.12,3.0,"Oh, they oh, they most most capable, capable, most capable schools or or you know, like I think university have already done something like, you know, they provided the free training for the students from the disadvantage of group or something."
36388,PS4,3,394.88,395.96,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, they already done that."
36388,PS4,3,397.2,399.16,1.96,2.0,Residential programs and things that people.
36388,PS4,3,400.2,402.72,2.52,3.0,They already done that and that is a free of charge or something.
36388,PS4,3,403.68,403.92,0.24,1.0,Like that?
36388,PS4,3,404.76,405.88,1.12,3.0,Shall we just skip this one?
36388,PS4,3,405.88,406.8,0.92,3.0,Probably for this I think.
36388,PS4,3,409.44,410.8,1.36,1.0,This is pretty good.
36388,PS4,3,411.2,415.2,4.0,1.0,OK to make funding more available to marginalised areas and groups.
36388,PS4,3,415.52,422.92,7.4,1.0,Partnership programs between high achieving private schools and state schools to work together and help those who are more disadvantaged.
36388,PS4,3,424.28,429.4,5.12,3.0,"A free, free program for the more something like, you know, kind."
36388,PS4,3,429.8,434.88,5.08,2.0,"Of yeah, like university outreach programs, I guess with, with like disadvantaged areas."
36388,PS4,3,434.88,437.84,2.96,2.0,"I mean, this is a yeah, this really happens, but it is."
36388,PS4,3,438.64,439.6,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, I'm like thinking how?"
36388,PS4,3,439.6,440.24,0.64,2.0,Creative.
36388,PS4,3,440.24,441.28,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, it's not very."
36388,PS4,3,442.12,446.48,4.36,2.0,"It's like, oh, I did this once so I guess."
36388,PS4,3,447.52,451.8,4.28,3.0,"Sit up, you know, like you know, sit up, they sit up."
36388,PS4,3,451.8,467.72,15.92,3.0,They funding or or no a local system to contribute today funding to the disadvantage area or groups to to support give them more financial support or something.
36388,PS4,3,468.2,476.96,8.76,1.0,But I wonder how the government can provide more resources to marginalised groups because they marginalised for a reason.
36388,PS4,3,477.6,482.64,5.04,1.0,"So if it was like that easy for governments to just, OK, I'm going to put more funding here."
36388,PS4,3,483.4,484.44,1.04,3.0,Shall we go for the next?
36388,PS4,3,484.44,484.72,0.28,2.0,1
36388,PS4,3,485.08,485.72,0.64,1.0,We can't go.
36388,PS4,3,485.72,491.88,6.16,2.0,Fashion is the place that the government should put the money for them to become not marginalized.
36388,PS4,3,492.08,492.6,0.52,2.0,You know what I mean?
36388,PS4,3,492.92,494.28,1.36,2.0,It's like if you start with I think.
36388,PS4,3,494.28,497.68,3.4,3.0,"Funding, Funding is very important factors so."
36388,PS4,3,497.76,499.36,1.6,1.0,How can we get the funding?
36388,PS4,3,499.52,511.72,12.2,3.0,"So, so you know, the lottery company, obviously if they have some actual, you know, if they even if they already got today funding, then they can contribute a part of that."
36388,PS4,3,511.8,517.28,5.48,3.0,"So that come from the the public, public funding system of."
36388,PS4,3,517.88,519.44,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, I mean, it's not redistribution, right?"
36388,PS4,3,519.44,529.0,9.56,2.0,"Like the money's somewhere, but it's not like, rather than putting it into like richer, like 'cause it's a funding that say the government gives to like local councils."
36388,PS4,3,529.92,536.4,6.48,2.0,"So you just make sure it's, it's like not equally weighted, like the more disadvantaged areas get more money."
36388,PS4,3,537.92,539.76,1.84,1.0,"OK, we'll just, we'll just click next."
36353,PS1,6,2.12,6.96,4.84,1.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problem for our of our lifetime.
36353,PS1,6,7.24,11.76,4.52,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic.
36353,PS1,6,12.48,18.16,5.68,1.0,It has to be nowhere and new recycling is already in place.
36353,PS1,6,18.48,20.56,2.08,2.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental.
36353,PS1,6,20.88,22.96,2.08,1.0,Problem recycling is already in place.
36353,PS1,6,23.48,25.0,1.52,2.0,That is still.
36353,PS1,6,26.12,28.36,2.24,3.0,Our option I.
36353,PS1,6,29.24,45.0,15.76,1.0,Think why not we do the how in a way to compensate anybody that can actually bring certain number of or I'm just trying to place it.
36353,PS1,6,45.0,56.4,11.4,1.0,"If there should be compensation for people that when you come into their waste, their waste can, there are no plastics in it, meaning they've already moved you for recycling."
36353,PS1,6,56.44,57.84,1.4,1.0,Recycling is already in place.
36353,PS1,6,57.84,61.6,3.76,1.0,"But a way that will facilitate recycling, do you get yes."
36353,PS1,6,61.64,62.12,0.48,4.0,Right facilitate.
36353,PS1,6,62.92,69.04,6.12,1.0,"Yes, yes, to re facilitate recycling because recycling is already in place and is efficient."
36353,PS1,6,69.28,74.28,5.0,1.0,But the problem is that how many people are actually turning out the waste for recycling.
36353,PS1,6,74.28,76.32,2.04,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36353,PS1,6,76.4,77.12,0.72,4.0,I feel like maybe I.
36353,PS1,6,77.28,78.04,0.76,1.0,Think if.
36353,PS1,6,79.68,86.72,7.04,4.0,"It's creative, maybe like if we have fins that every time you put something in there you can."
36353,PS1,6,86.72,87.16,0.44,1.0,Get 20.
36353,PS1,6,87.4,88.64,1.24,4.0,"Seats back, yeah."
36353,PS1,6,88.64,92.8,4.16,4.0,"And like that money comes from the government, from from like taxes or whatever."
36353,PS1,6,92.8,93.6,0.8,4.0,So every time.
36353,PS1,6,93.6,94.96,1.36,1.0,That's we're recycling.
36353,PS1,6,95.0,96.44,1.44,4.0,"Yeah, you get some money back."
36353,PS1,6,96.96,104.08,7.12,5.0,And it's also the the problem that people put stuff in the cycling bin that shouldn't be that exactly like stuff that's like soiled and things and then it can't.
36353,PS1,6,104.08,106.6,2.52,4.0,Be so then they're going to get the money because that's the wrong thing.
36353,PS1,6,106.92,107.56,0.64,5.0,So how would it?
36353,PS1,6,107.56,108.56,1.0,5.0,How would it work?
36353,PS1,6,108.56,109.28,0.72,5.0,How would you?
36353,PS1,6,109.32,110.08,0.76,5.0,How would you get money?
36353,PS1,6,110.44,111.24,0.8,4.0,The the government.
36353,PS1,6,111.68,113.24,1.56,4.0,So then we supply all the bins.
36353,PS1,6,114.2,116.48,2.28,1.0,"And and once you put, you take your."
36353,PS1,6,116.64,116.8,0.16,5.0,Money.
36353,PS1,6,116.8,122.84,6.04,5.0,"And then if it's like you could put anything in there, it's like you could, would you still get the money even if you put something in there?"
36353,PS1,6,123.28,124.76,1.48,1.0,There must be plastics.
36353,PS1,6,126.12,126.2,0.08,3.0,How?
36353,PS1,6,126.8,127.16,0.36,5.0,Do you really?
36353,PS1,6,127.24,127.72,0.48,5.0,How do you?
36353,PS1,6,127.72,128.08,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, like."
36353,PS1,6,128.24,129.4,1.16,1.0,How do you know how much?
36353,PS1,6,129.68,131.4,1.72,6.0,Do you know exactly what they are putting in?
36353,PS1,6,131.44,132.24,0.8,3.0,"There, and who and who did?"
36353,PS1,6,132.6,134.72,2.12,1.0,"No, I think there is something in place."
36353,PS1,6,134.72,136.72,2.0,1.0,So I've seen that in NVIDIA or something.
36353,PS1,6,136.72,143.84,7.12,1.0,"Where you pack trash cans, put it in somewhere in your calculator, and then you receive the money in return."
36353,PS1,6,143.84,144.92,1.08,1.0,I think I've seen that when you're like.
36353,PS1,6,145.4,146.32,0.92,4.0,Buying something in.
36353,PS1,6,147.28,147.76,0.48,1.0,The basket.
36353,PS1,6,148.16,150.68,2.52,4.0,"Somehow they know that that's the item, yes."
36353,PS1,6,150.68,151.04,0.36,4.0,So I.
36353,PS1,6,151.12,155.56,4.44,1.0,Think they might have the system might have a detector to know that these are plastics.
36353,PS1,6,155.88,158.4,2.52,1.0,"So if they have plastics, you're not getting paid."
36353,PS1,6,158.4,168.2,9.8,1.0,"No, they they they might have sensors like when when you're buying things now you're scanning your the things you're buying."
36353,PS1,6,168.2,168.32,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36353,PS1,6,169.12,181.52,12.4,1.0,"And for you to stand them on that nylon, there are sense of all, yes, labels on it that can those things can sense that this is what you're buying for or this is what you want to."
36353,PS1,6,181.64,182.04,0.4,3.0,Pay for.
36353,PS1,6,182.04,184.68,2.64,3.0,So how do you put it in in less than 10 words?
36353,PS1,6,184.96,186.84,1.88,3.0,"OK, the word count is not."
36353,PS1,6,186.88,189.56,2.68,1.0,"Actually, OK, yeah, it's just as much as as much as it can."
36353,PS1,6,189.8,190.44,0.64,1.0,It doesn't actually.
36353,PS1,6,193.0,200.96,7.96,6.0,Just paid compensate Compensate compositional plans for plastic disposal.
36353,PS1,6,205.32,210.44,5.12,3.0,"Residence remuneration for facilitation, recycling, something like."
36353,PS1,6,211.52,215.44,3.92,2.0,"That or by the way, we have discussed about recycling."
36353,PS1,6,215.56,216.92,1.36,1.0,Plastic I.
36353,PS1,6,216.96,217.28,0.32,2.0,Think that?
36353,PS1,6,217.32,220.84,3.52,2.0,What about those who choose not to use plastic in the 1st place?
36353,PS1,6,221.04,223.8,2.76,2.0,So could we encourage that thing that you refuse?
36353,PS1,6,224.16,224.76,0.6,1.0,Your plastic.
36353,PS1,6,224.76,224.92,0.16,2.0,That's.
36353,PS1,6,226.84,226.96,0.12,1.0,Good.
36353,PS1,6,226.96,227.16,0.2,1.0,OK.
36353,PS1,6,227.16,228.2,1.04,1.0,Is it showing because?
36353,PS1,6,228.2,233.28,5.08,2.0,"Once it's in the chain, there are many ways to get hit somewhere."
36353,PS1,6,233.6,238.64,5.04,2.0,"But what if we don't use plastic, or at least minimize the use of plastic in the first place?"
36353,PS1,6,240.04,243.8,3.76,3.0,What are the alternatives if you refuse to use a air plastic?
36353,PS1,6,243.96,244.96,1.0,1.0,What are the alternatives?
36353,PS1,6,244.96,248.0,3.04,2.0,Not there unlike before industrial regulation.
36353,PS1,6,248.24,256.96,8.72,2.0,"So what we used to do that time that I products were less durable or compatible, but I think our entries are always there."
36353,PS1,6,257.72,274.48,16.76,2.0,So there are two ideas from one is we incentivize those who refuse plastic use and 2nd as you suggested that incentivize those as well who recycle plastic I think can put together and make it.
36353,PS1,6,277.2,277.96,0.76,6.0,"OK, now."
36353,PS1,6,278.68,279.84,1.16,3.0,Now considering that what?
36353,PS1,6,279.92,280.6,0.68,2.0,Prices for.
36353,PS1,6,281.04,281.96,0.92,3.0,Aspire pay anything in.
36353,PS1,6,283.4,287.48,4.08,6.0,"Anything, yeah, we should be more expensive than than the others."
36353,PS1,6,287.48,291.76,4.28,6.0,"So that means they have to, we have to have system in place, alternatives in place."
36353,PS1,6,292.96,298.96,6.0,3.0,So but then I think since the whole idea of this research is to compare our views to those of.
36353,PS1,6,299.88,303.48,3.6,1.0,AI and they have to be nowhere useful something you can.
36353,PS1,6,303.52,310.76,7.24,3.0,"Certainly should be one of our points then, since incentivization will also be another point for residents that participate in recycling."
36353,PS1,6,311.04,312.6,1.56,1.0,The government policy.
36353,PS1,6,313.48,314.64,1.16,1.0,"Government policy, too."
36353,PS1,6,314.92,317.36,2.44,3.0,But come up with one creative.
36353,PS1,6,317.52,318.8,1.28,1.0,This one creative idea.
36353,PS1,6,319.08,322.04,2.96,1.0,I think government policy would also.
36353,PS1,6,323.6,327.28,3.68,3.0,Which which we sent down the centralization government police will not.
36353,PS1,6,327.44,345.28,17.84,1.0,Only maybe the companies that the companies that actually produce this products with plastic in it should be mandated to find a way of ensuring there is adequate recycling of those.
36353,PS1,6,346.76,347.56,0.8,5.0,"I'd rather not, sorry."
36353,PS1,6,347.6,347.72,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36353,PS1,6,348.8,349.32,0.52,2.0,You made it.
36353,PS1,6,349.64,350.4,0.76,5.0,"No, I'd rather not."
36353,PS1,6,350.4,351.32,0.92,5.0,"It sounds like the menace, OK?"
36353,PS1,6,353.0,369.72,16.72,3.0,"But I think it will be a bit difficult for companies to regret the use of plastics because if products are sent from companies, just like for example, Coca-Cola, companies cannot go round no, to recycle their plastics themselves alone."
36353,PS1,6,370.24,373.32,3.08,3.0,"But residents can participate in recycling, you understand?"
36353,PS1,6,373.6,377.28,3.68,1.0,"I remember Toby, there is this thing Coca-Cola does in Nigeria does this."
36353,PS1,6,377.96,390.48,12.52,1.0,"If you want to buy a product Coke in a bottle, you bring a bottle in exchange, an empty bottle to collect a bottle that is, that has Coke content in it."
36353,PS1,6,390.84,402.52,11.68,1.0,"So for you to buy 1 bottle of Pepsi with a plastic, you return the one you've used before, you return that, you return that."
36353,PS1,6,402.52,403.76,1.24,1.0,What do you think about that?
36353,PS1,6,404.4,405.96,1.56,1.0,You return the one you've used.
36353,PS1,6,405.96,408.96,3.0,1.0,That will be the policy that the Government will ensure.
36353,PS1,6,408.96,409.12,0.16,6.0,What?
36353,PS1,6,411.88,414.68,2.8,1.0,"If you haven't used that, then if you're buying, if you buy, if you're buying, if you'd rather."
36353,PS1,6,414.68,418.84,4.16,6.0,"Be that if you'd rather, be that if you are if you are returning a."
36353,PS1,6,418.84,419.4,0.56,3.0,Plastic.
36353,PS1,6,419.76,421.88,2.12,6.0,"Yeah, there should be a drop in price for you."
36353,PS1,6,422.36,428.56,6.2,6.0,"Anytime you go to buy and you are returning that particular empty container, there should be a drop in price for you."
36353,PS1,6,428.64,431.36,2.72,1.0,"So the one creative that this is OK, good."
36353,PS1,6,431.56,432.84,1.28,6.0,This is better than the rest.
36353,PS1,6,433.6,435.2,1.6,1.0,"OK, So what am I typing?"
36353,PS1,6,437.04,447.44,10.4,6.0,Compensation Monetary compensation for anyone who returns a particular empty or used plastic whenever he wants 1 back.

36119,PS1,6,95.28,96.52,1.24,4.0,Introduced so it's not creative I.
36119,PS1,6,96.56,97.84,1.28,3.0,Mean I.

36119,PS1,6,122.76,124.44,1.68,6.0,The problem is there's no replacement.
36119,PS1,6,124.92,125.32,0.4,5.0,If you think.
36119,PS1,6,126.52,131.52,5.0,3.0,Yesterday we were talking about actually if we thought that it would.

36233,PS6,3,91.84,111.56,19.72,3.0,Effort and maybe just when we post the things on social media system and just point out that this has been published in some kind of yeah and that is verified by scientists to show that this is actually good for your health so.
36233,PS6,3,111.6,112.28,0.68,1.0,Randomised.
36233,PS6,3,112.28,112.44,0.16,3.0,Can.

36233,PS6,3,186.56,188.76,2.2,1.0,Release your Unleash your.
34420,PS6,6,5.92,7.2,1.28,1.0,I can think of the typing because.
34420,PS6,6,8.8,10.6,1.8,2.0,You might want to come here and.
34420,PS6,6,11.68,33.28,21.6,1.0,"You can just tell me what the fuck this is not imagine a new research study discovers that singing in the shower for 20 minutes or more is good for health, not for neighbors."
34420,PS6,6,33.52,36.76,3.24,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to encourage people to do this.
34420,PS6,6,42.4,48.8,6.4,2.0,Make some kind of phones that are like waterproof or some cases and this exist but giving them out.
34420,PS6,6,49.52,52.36,2.84,1.0,Giving them out for free or subsidized.
34420,PS6,6,52.72,54.08,1.36,2.0,Speakers in the bathroom.
34420,PS6,6,55.76,56.88,1.12,1.0,Speakers in the bathroom.
34420,PS6,6,57.4,61.56,4.16,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, like a little shower speak like, yeah, you're the ones that like stick onto the side."

34420,PS6,6,65.0,65.72,0.72,4.0,Music coming up.
34420,PS6,6,66.36,69.72,3.36,1.0,"OK, so we have one creative idea."
34420,PS6,6,69.72,78.92,9.2,1.0,"So I I would suggest let's like take maybe 3 to 4 minutes, breaks down more ideas and then select one and then we'll just like right everything about the second one."
34420,PS6,6,79.36,87.08,7.72,5.0,"So a movie in the bathroom, when you sing, it's disappear, ghosts disappear, something like that."
34420,PS6,6,89.16,91.76,2.6,1.0,But then what if people do not believe that there are ghosts to start?
34420,PS6,6,96.72,104.52,7.8,1.0,"I was thinking perhaps that, you know, maybe I'm, I'm approaching it from a very sort of like academic perspective, but there's something called the health belief model."
34420,PS6,6,104.84,117.0,12.16,1.0,"So in order for you to convince somebody that they should do something, you should basically try, try to tell them what, what are basically the implications of not doing that."
34420,PS6,6,117.48,130.08,12.6,1.0,"And you could divide these implications into economic, health based, sociological, sort of like, you know, cultural perceptions about not doing such a thing."
34420,PS6,6,130.44,139.24,8.8,1.0,"So I was thinking, I don't know, we could, we could maybe try to say that, you know, it would make them in a better mood and that would boost their immunity."
34420,PS6,6,139.24,140.6,1.36,1.0,They would live for longer.
34420,PS6,6,140.6,146.76,6.16,1.0,"They would lead healthier lives with their they would, you know, have more sustainable relationships because they're happier to start with."
34420,PS6,6,147.04,148.24,1.2,1.0,It would be more sociable.
34420,PS6,6,148.24,152.84,4.6,1.0,"That would have a positive effect on their productivity at work, so on and so forth."
34420,PS6,6,154.6,157.08,2.48,2.0,So basically telling them about the advantages of that.
34420,PS6,6,159.4,162.12,2.72,6.0,It's about a speaker I'm thinking of a microphone in.
34420,PS6,6,171.44,171.64,0.2,4.0,It.
34420,PS6,6,178.4,180.44,2.04,1.0,Soundproof the walls and everything.
34420,PS6,6,181.72,188.44,6.72,4.0,"Honestly, I really feel like who would feel intimidated to say because I want to get rid of that worry."
34420,PS6,6,188.96,189.28,0.32,1.0,OK.
34420,PS6,6,189.28,191.52,2.24,2.0,I think that's a strong one.
34420,PS6,6,196.16,196.48,0.32,1.0,OK.
34420,PS6,6,196.68,208.84,12.16,1.0,"So we like the idea of basically sort of like providing people, if we don't want to say fully for free to just make it, you know, seem more practical, like subsidized, let's say sinking set or whatever it is."
34420,PS6,6,208.84,213.12,4.28,1.0,"That includes the speakers, microphones, and soundproofing the bathroom walls."
34420,PS6,6,213.6,215.44,1.84,1.0,"OK, this is how we're going to encourage people to do this."
34420,PS6,6,215.68,218.76,3.08,1.0,"Let's think a little bit of the devil, the devil's advocate side."
34420,PS6,6,219.36,222.36,3.0,1.0,Imagine if you're really adamant about not singing in the bathroom.
34420,PS6,6,222.88,225.04,2.16,1.0,"How would we, how would we convince you?"
34420,PS6,6,225.04,225.88,0.84,1.0,Would that convince you?
34420,PS6,6,226.4,229.84,3.44,1.0,The fact that you're going to be offered this subsidized sort of like package?
34420,PS6,6,229.84,233.88,4.04,1.0,"I mean, it's good for your health."
34420,PS6,6,233.88,237.12,3.24,1.0,"So this is on its own is a motivator, but there are a lot of things that are good for your."
34420,PS6,6,237.16,237.6,0.44,4.0,"Health, they just."
34420,PS6,6,237.6,243.72,6.12,2.0,"Encouraging people so it's not like they want, they want us to encourage them, not to convince them."
34420,PS6,6,244.24,246.4,2.16,1.0,"OK, see you're playing now."
34420,PS6,6,248.72,248.96,0.24,1.0,OK dear.
34420,PS6,6,249.68,252.4,2.72,1.0,So we we we stick to that idea.

34420,PS6,6,258.16,259.8,1.64,4.0,Just to sorry.
34420,PS6,6,261.4,262.52,1.12,1.0,Say 8 minutes.
34420,PS6,6,262.52,264.4,1.88,4.0,Is for this question right now.
34420,PS6,6,265.0,265.24,0.24,1.0,Yes.
34420,PS6,6,265.24,271.84,6.6,2.0,She said tell me somewhere in the emails that people sometimes finish much earlier than two hours.
34420,PS6,6,289.4,297.68,8.28,1.0,"Should we also include anything that has to do with like, you know, Internet access so that they could like, you know, and without ads."
34420,PS6,6,297.72,300.04,2.32,1.0,"I hate YouTube yes, thank you."
34420,PS6,6,300.04,300.56,0.52,1.0,"OK, OK."

34420,PS6,6,315.56,319.08,3.52,4.0,I think offline playlist is probably easier to make happen than Yeah OK.
34420,PS6,6,319.56,320.4,0.84,1.0,"OK, OK."
34420,PS6,6,320.6,324.44,3.84,1.0,"And offline ad free, Yeah, yeah."
34420,PS6,6,325.72,325.84,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34420,PS6,6,326.36,326.52,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
34420,PS6,6,328.84,333.64,4.8,4.0,"I was thinking, because if we're going to do subsidized, it's like we could just kind of collaborate with these."
34420,PS6,6,334.92,336.2,1.28,1.0,Sponsors that provide.
34420,PS6,6,336.2,338.44,2.24,4.0,These things so that it's exposure for.
34420,PS6,6,340.0,347.64,7.64,1.0,"Them yeah, about the sound soundproofing the walls, are we going to like offer the service or how do you want me to phrase it?"
34420,PS6,6,349.92,354.48,4.56,2.0,"I mean what you just said, no collaborations."
34420,PS6,6,355.88,356.16,0.28,1.0,OK.
34420,PS6,6,359.72,359.92,0.2,1.0,OK.
34420,PS6,6,359.92,362.12,2.2,1.0,So we could collaborate.
34420,PS6,6,362.32,362.68,0.36,3.0,With.
34420,PS6,6,363.24,363.88,0.64,1.0,What are they called?
34420,PS6,6,363.88,366.04,2.16,1.0,Like music companies.
34420,PS6,6,366.28,366.92,0.64,1.0,What do we call them?
34420,PS6,6,369.44,369.96,0.52,1.0,I don't know.
34420,PS6,6,370.88,373.12,2.24,6.0,Reconstruction family because they can do like.
34420,PS6,6,375.8,378.88,3.08,1.0,"Construction and like, you know, music, I think."
34420,PS6,6,379.6,384.0,4.4,4.0,You could get like those panels like.
34420,PS6,6,384.6,384.72,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34420,PS6,6,384.72,386.72,2.0,3.0,"Oh yeah, rather than getting someone to like new."
34420,PS6,6,396.76,397.24,0.48,1.0,Technology.
34420,PS6,6,399.56,399.84,0.28,4.0,You just.
34420,PS6,6,405.12,405.44,0.32,1.0,Need to be.
34420,PS6,6,405.48,405.96,0.48,4.0,Creative.
34420,PS6,6,406.24,410.48,4.24,4.0,I don't know.
34420,PS6,6,410.48,412.2,1.72,1.0,"Their housemates, that's."
34420,PS6,6,412.44,412.96,0.52,4.0,About two hours.
34420,PS6,6,419.24,424.24,5.0,1.0,"And not be conscious about their OK, no, I'm just going to say that not be conscious about their bad boys."
34420,PS6,6,424.56,434.2,9.64,1.0,"But there's like if, if they are going to spend in the shower for 20 minutes, OK, sitting in the shower for 20 minutes or more is good for health, OK."
34420,PS6,6,434.2,443.04,8.84,1.0,"So if people are going to spend 20 minutes or more in the shower, then they're going to pay more bills for heating the water and for using more."
34420,PS6,6,443.08,443.84,0.76,2.0,"Water, yeah, but."
34420,PS6,6,447.16,447.92,0.76,1.0,"Like, you know, there's that."
34420,PS6,6,449.08,449.92,0.84,2.0,It's so bad.
34420,PS6,6,451.72,453.6,1.88,1.0,How could we do like for water?
34420,PS6,6,453.6,457.44,3.84,1.0,"Because yeah, environmentally speaking, this is going to be bad for that."
34420,PS6,6,457.44,458.88,1.44,1.0,I have a bathtub and.
34420,PS6,6,459.88,460.24,0.36,6.0,Or is it?
34420,PS6,6,460.48,461.28,0.8,4.0,Should we shower?
34420,PS6,6,462.76,464.52,1.76,1.0,Singing in the shower for 20 minutes.
34420,PS6,6,465.4,466.8,1.4,1.0,But it's it's a bit.
34420,PS6,6,467.48,467.96,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, I."
34420,PS6,6,470.72,473.52,2.8,6.0,Don't know but like 20 minutes before staying in the.
34420,PS6,6,473.56,474.32,0.76,4.0,Bathtub and.
34420,PS6,6,474.96,475.4,0.44,6.0,Just thinking.
34420,PS6,6,476.2,480.64,4.44,2.0,"But I actually don't think like, it doesn't seem like that's what they're asking us to think about as well."
34420,PS6,6,480.64,480.88,0.24,1.0,"Oh, yeah."
34420,PS6,6,480.88,492.68,11.8,1.0,"But you know, I'm just like throwing it an extra point because because that I'm thinking right now, that point really also depends on like we, you know, what's the baseline time for, for, for people in the shower."
34420,PS6,6,492.68,499.56,6.88,1.0,"Like, you know, I usually take 13 to 15 minutes maximum, you know, but some people, some people usually take more."
34420,PS6,6,499.56,500.84,1.28,1.0,So that wouldn't be a problem for them.
34420,PS6,6,500.84,503.32,2.48,1.0,"You know, I think that's a concluding."
34420,PS6,6,505.76,506.44,0.68,5.0,Problem research maybe?
34420,PS6,6,506.48,509.2,2.72,5.0,So our aim is to make some encourage them to do.
34420,PS6,6,509.32,509.44,0.12,1.0,This.
34420,PS6,6,509.56,510.36,0.8,1.0,"Oh yeah, Yeah."
34420,PS6,6,510.96,516.6,5.64,4.0,"In the worst case, what is worth, I think the benefit maybe is because of the steam and whatnot."
34420,PS6,6,516.6,520.64,4.04,4.0,So theoretically the steam doesn't go away immediately after you turn off the shower anyways.
34420,PS6,6,521.0,526.0,5.0,4.0,Like if they really want to save water or whatever then they could shower for 15 minutes which is like average showering time just.
34420,PS6,6,526.52,528.04,1.52,1.0,"Leave the steam going, close the."
34420,PS6,6,528.08,528.32,0.24,4.0,Door.
34420,PS6,6,528.68,529.0,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, just."
34420,PS6,6,529.64,536.08,6.44,4.0,"You know, and I still kind of get the benefits -5 minutes a lot."
34420,PS6,6,537.12,537.4,0.28,1.0,OK.
34420,PS6,6,538.68,539.32,0.64,4.0,But like is it?
34420,PS6,6,540.0,540.64,0.64,1.0,Satisfied.
34420,PS6,6,540.68,542.0,1.32,1.0,Want us to move to the second question?
34420,PS6,6,555.44,555.56,0.12,1.0,Yes.
34231,PS4,6,0.0,726.6,0.76,1.0,Educational.
34231,PS4,6,727.68,727.96,0.28,1.0,Oh my.
34231,PS4,6,729.52,735.32,5.8,4.0,God to overcome inequality in education.
34231,PS4,6,735.56,736.56,1.0,4.0,"Jeez, that's so hard."
34231,PS4,6,736.92,737.0,0.08,2.0,My.
34231,PS4,6,737.12,738.04,0.92,5.0,God in education.
34231,PS4,6,738.4,739.04,0.64,2.0,12 minutes.
34231,PS4,6,739.52,739.92,0.4,1.0,I mean.
34231,PS4,6,742.32,742.6,0.28,5.0,OK.
34231,PS4,6,742.84,748.4,5.56,5.0,"I mean, there's so many online resources that you can level at YouTube, you know, free resources online."
34231,PS4,6,748.64,750.8,2.16,6.0,They're probably looking at the global scale.
34231,PS4,6,750.8,755.84,5.04,6.0,"For example, people in less developed countries are not able to access the Internet like something like that."
34231,PS4,6,756.04,756.4,0.36,6.0,And it was.
34231,PS4,6,756.52,757.6,1.08,5.0,Like global everywhere.
34231,PS4,6,757.64,759.64,2.0,5.0,Anyone have a small laptop or a no not?
34231,PS4,6,760.08,760.4,0.32,2.0,Everywhere.
34231,PS4,6,761.24,761.8,0.56,6.0,Realistically.
34231,PS4,6,764.32,766.16,1.84,6.0,"Realistically, this one has never seen the Internet."
34231,PS4,6,766.84,770.24,3.4,5.0,Literally high personal have never have access realistically.
34231,PS4,6,770.28,770.68,0.4,1.0,There's yeah there.
34231,PS4,6,770.68,773.12,2.44,2.0,Was there was like news on on news?
34231,PS4,6,773.12,780.12,7.0,2.0,Like there was a tribe in the Amazon forest and they just recently they got connected to the Internet and all of the villagers.
34231,PS4,6,780.12,782.12,2.0,2.0,"Yes and yeah, yeah."
34231,PS4,6,782.12,782.2,0.08,2.0,The.
34231,PS4,6,782.88,786.04,3.16,5.0,"Other thing is in terms of these tribes and villages, do they actually?"
34231,PS4,6,787.48,790.44,2.96,5.0,"Yeah, but do they actually want to change their lifestyles?"
34231,PS4,6,790.48,791.04,0.56,5.0,A lot of.
34231,PS4,6,794.48,794.84,0.36,6.0,Education.
34231,PS4,6,796.12,802.12,6.0,6.0,"I think because education also equates to monetary well commitment, right?"
34231,PS4,6,802.28,805.76,3.48,6.0,"Because you have need to have the resources you need to have the team, anything."
34231,PS4,6,809.4,820.2,10.8,6.0,"So I think one idea would be to create a group of volunteers, professionals who are willing to take on, you know, charity work for a year or one or two years."
34231,PS4,6,820.48,827.76,7.28,6.0,We travel around the world going to these less developed charges first in the engagement with the Western.
34231,PS4,6,827.76,828.76,1.0,1.0,World what it is?
34231,PS4,6,830.0,834.64,4.64,6.0,And then teaching fundamentals of natural sciences and everything art history.
34231,PS4,6,835.16,839.36,4.2,6.0,So that would be 1 solution to have like a escort basically traveling around.
34231,PS4,6,839.56,840.4,0.84,5.0,"Yeah, this happened."
34231,PS4,6,840.4,842.24,1.84,5.0,"Yeah, they do that quite it happens."
34231,PS4,6,842.24,849.92,7.68,6.0,"Given the fact that obviously the resources are attained, otherwise there's no incentive."
34231,PS4,6,850.24,851.2,0.96,1.0,To kind of solve that issue.
34231,PS4,6,851.64,855.64,4.0,5.0,"There are websites actually that you can go, you know, go look, There are a lot of websites."
34231,PS4,6,856.36,856.76,0.4,5.0,No good.
34231,PS4,6,856.76,857.4,0.64,5.0,I'll do that.
34231,PS4,6,857.88,863.68,5.8,5.0,"Yeah, You can sign in and go, you know, travel, go in Africa and teach English, maths, for maths one month."
34231,PS4,6,865.28,865.52,0.24,5.0,"Yeah, sure."
34231,PS4,6,867.52,868.32,0.8,5.0,"Yeah, it does have to be."
34231,PS4,6,868.32,868.76,0.44,5.0,We can or.
34231,PS4,6,869.96,870.6,0.64,2.0,We can check.
34231,PS4,6,870.8,870.88,0.08,5.0,On.
34231,PS4,6,870.88,876.24,5.36,2.0,Existing like now you're just handing the CDs and then screen it and then introduce this.
34231,PS4,6,876.24,876.68,0.44,2.0,Quite typical.
34231,PS4,6,878.12,879.0,0.88,4.0,Actually wondering.
34231,PS4,6,879.16,879.52,0.36,1.0,Why?
34231,PS4,6,881.12,883.32,2.2,4.0,Why do we have any quality education?
34231,PS4,6,884.76,887.04,2.28,6.0,Barely any like money is not equal.
34231,PS4,6,889.4,903.36,13.96,1.0,"Is it not unequal to say that, oh, you are, you are disadvantaged, therefore we would, even though you, your grades are worse than someone who has advantages and he has very great because he had better experiences, but your grades are worse, but we're going to let you in because you're disadvantaged."
34231,PS4,6,903.36,905.64,2.28,1.0,"Like, isn't that unequal to the person who."
34231,PS4,6,905.96,906.96,1.0,1.0,"Yeah, of course."
34231,PS4,6,907.16,908.36,1.2,1.0,So that's like like.
34231,PS4,6,909.48,913.52,4.04,4.0,"I'm I like, I understand with college, we're like with institutions."
34231,PS4,6,913.56,921.32,7.76,4.0,"That's, that's, that's, that's almost an insolvable problem because impossible to solve because there's limited space and limited teachers."
34231,PS4,6,921.6,926.52,4.92,4.0,"But then we, we have all the online contents and all the knowledge on Internet now."
34231,PS4,6,926.84,930.76,3.92,4.0,"Why are there still inequality in education for those, for them?"
34231,PS4,6,931.4,933.48,2.08,4.0,I don't think it's simply providing Internet.
34231,PS4,6,934.16,937.88,3.72,4.0,"That's certainly not enough, so I wonder what's the roots in that?"
34231,PS4,6,937.88,940.56,2.68,4.0,Like why aren't kids learning from the Internet it?
34231,PS4,6,940.96,944.6,3.64,1.0,"Depends on how much you talk about inequality in education, right?"
34231,PS4,6,944.6,948.16,3.56,1.0,"Like inequality, you can originally from so many different aspects."
34231,PS4,6,948.16,949.32,1.16,1.0,Like there you can be.
34231,PS4,6,949.48,958.32,8.84,1.0,You can have grown up in a culture or like a area where going to school was not cool or even if I'm going to learning stuff online was not cool.
34231,PS4,6,958.32,964.04,5.72,1.0,You were you could have been exposed to grasp like been bought by graspers.
34231,PS4,6,964.04,966.52,2.48,1.0,"Parents like don't go to school, just just work."
34231,PS4,6,966.52,969.12,2.6,1.0,Just go out and make money for the family.
34231,PS4,6,970.0,973.44,3.44,1.0,Do what do find whatever methods you can to to make money right?
34231,PS4,6,973.68,980.12,6.44,1.0,Like and then that removes any educational advantage that you might ever have like so.
34231,PS4,6,980.12,990.84,10.72,6.0,"What 1 hot thing I would say is like especially for Western countries where people just what don't go to school, they are let letting less less develop well less paying wages."
34231,PS4,6,991.4,999.56,8.16,6.0,"I would say these, these countries actually do not have the issue with education inequality because the facilities there, the schools are mostly free in those countries."
34231,PS4,6,999.92,1005.36,5.44,6.0,So it's just a voluntary decision to be affected by the educational inequality.
34231,PS4,6,1005.92,1012.52,6.6,6.0,"Whereas we have to look at the scope of on a global scale where this facility is not even there, the resources are not being provided."
34231,PS4,6,1012.72,1013.12,0.4,6.0,How well?
34231,PS4,6,1013.4,1014.52,1.12,5.0,Is money the problem?
34231,PS4,6,1014.64,1015.12,0.48,5.0,The problem?
34231,PS4,6,1015.64,1016.72,1.08,5.0,My finance.
34231,PS4,6,1017.44,1018.2,0.76,6.0,Decision making.
34231,PS4,6,1018.2,1019.2,1.0,5.0,If you don't.
34231,PS4,6,1020.36,1022.6,2.24,6.0,"If you have access to the Internet, everything is there."
34231,PS4,6,1022.6,1023.16,0.56,6.0,You don't want to.
34231,PS4,6,1023.2,1023.6,0.4,5.0,The worst?
34231,PS4,6,1023.64,1025.12,1.48,5.0,"Yeah, that's a minority."
34231,PS4,6,1025.24,1025.4,0.16,6.0,Yeah.
34231,PS4,6,1025.4,1028.12,2.72,6.0,"But then there's again, there's a voluntary disclosure being."
34231,PS4,6,1029.08,1032.48,3.4,1.0,"I'm thinking, how about like, you have to create a one creative idea, right?"
34231,PS4,6,1032.76,1064.04,31.28,1.0,"So why not like, let's say the creation of a global nonprofit that wants to foster an open online university with courses provided pro bono or like by by university professors, like for example, a judge as a part of a judge's ESG obligations, they provide maybe a course or two and then every university or like every good university, maybe university, some courses there and then people can go online and learn those stuff for free."
34231,PS4,6,1064.92,1071.0,6.08,1.0,"Obviously you don't have the diploma that goes along with the certification, but you get the education and that's what matters."
34231,PS4,6,1071.8,1076.2,4.4,1.0,Like the an online global that's open to everyone to access.
34231,PS4,6,1076.4,1079.56,3.16,1.0,Like I'm thinking course Coursera but you have to pay for Coursera sometimes.

34231,PS4,6,1340.24,1341.08,0.84,6.0,Resources have to be there.
34231,PS4,6,1341.68,1345.36,3.68,1.0,"In this case, the basic resources are there, we just need to get them to to go there."
34231,PS4,6,1347.12,1348.72,1.6,4.0,"So it's awareness, not willingness."
34231,PS4,6,1349.04,1351.12,2.08,4.0,"Willingness is hard to cover, but awareness?"
34231,PS4,6,1351.16,1351.64,0.48,6.0,Awareness is.

34231,PS4,6,1459.32,1459.48,0.16,6.0,No.
35192,PS4,3,0.48,1.36,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, it's fine."
35192,PS4,3,2.96,4.68,1.72,1.0,Educational Inequality.
35192,PS4,3,16.12,18.76,2.64,2.0,"Yeah, inequality in education."
35192,PS4,3,20.28,21.44,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, equality."
35192,PS4,3,26.4,27.6,1.2,1.0,It sounds very political.
35192,PS4,3,27.8,28.36,0.56,3.0,Exactly.
35192,PS4,3,28.36,30.0,1.64,3.0,"Yeah, it's, it's quite serious."
35192,PS4,3,31.24,32.08,0.84,3.0,It's important though.
35192,PS4,3,32.08,36.32,4.24,3.0,"But yeah, yeah, it's a creative idea."
35192,PS4,3,46.0,47.76,1.76,3.0,"Well, I mean, I mean, just to start with what?"
35192,PS4,3,47.84,49.44,1.6,3.0,"Like, what are we saying?"
35192,PS4,3,49.44,51.64,2.2,3.0,Like what are the resources we're talking about here?
35192,PS4,3,51.64,54.24,2.6,3.0,"Like, is it just the good quality?"
35192,PS4,3,54.6,58.04,3.44,3.0,"Whatever teachers, facilities, you know, buildings like what?"
35192,PS4,3,58.04,58.28,0.24,3.0,What?
35192,PS4,3,58.4,59.16,0.76,3.0,What do they mean?
35192,PS4,3,59.72,61.12,1.4,1.0,I think it could be everything.
35192,PS4,3,61.24,81.24,20.0,1.0,"So coming from my context, private schools are better than public schools and private schools have better teachers and they actually attend classes and there's libraries with books, things like that."
35192,PS4,3,81.24,86.44,5.2,1.0,So and regular tests and people care whether you attend a test or you don't.
35192,PS4,3,86.44,94.8,8.36,1.0,"Classes have relatively fewer students, 20 maybe, but if you go to a public school it's like 100 in a class."
35192,PS4,3,95.44,96.92,1.48,1.0,So things like that.
35192,PS4,3,96.92,101.68,4.76,1.0,I think generally this is difficult to answer.
35192,PS4,3,102.72,111.2,8.48,2.0,"Yeah, I, I may share little information because when I live in Norway, Norway, I live in Norway for four years."
35192,PS4,3,112.28,130.92,18.64,2.0,"Norwegian government when they dispute the money or funding to the university according to the rank of the the academic performance, the rank of academic performance of the university, but they dispute more money for the last rank."
35192,PS4,3,131.44,131.96,0.52,3.0,OK.
35192,PS4,3,132.48,155.2,22.72,2.0,"University right, the first the top ranked university no money, OK, that's the Norwegian and then they agree they all agree this value because the better performance University, of course they need the support yeah, the and the top ranked university and please apply for the grant of funding from Europe by yourself."
35192,PS4,3,155.68,155.8,0.12,3.0,OK.
35192,PS4,3,156.64,157.44,0.8,2.0,And they agree.
35192,PS4,3,157.92,158.28,0.36,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS4,3,158.48,158.76,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS4,3,159.44,166.08,6.64,2.0,"And OK, so, but is this creative way it's have already be done by Norwegian people?"
35192,PS4,3,167.64,168.04,0.4,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS4,3,168.04,171.08,3.04,3.0,The problem is the creative part of it like.
35192,PS4,3,178.48,179.0,0.52,1.0,So.
35192,PS4,3,180.2,192.48,12.28,2.0,"But it's probably a creative part because in my, in my best of my knowledge, only Norway or the North Europe country have done this."
35192,PS4,3,192.68,193.76,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS4,3,193.76,200.04,6.28,2.0,"We have 1-2 hundred countries in the world, but only two, one or two countries."
35192,PS4,3,200.44,202.16,1.72,2.0,They they have done this.
35192,PS4,3,202.4,202.64,0.24,2.0,OK.
35192,PS4,3,202.76,203.0,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35192,PS4,3,203.92,204.12,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35192,PS4,3,204.12,206.84,2.72,1.0,So it is innovative.
35192,PS4,3,211.44,229.64,18.2,2.0,"So we the, the key concept is that we give the we we distribute, we assign more money to the low rank university or any educational urbanization."
35192,PS4,3,229.72,229.84,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS4,3,230.08,230.72,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS4,3,230.84,232.52,1.68,1.0,"I mean, it's yeah."
35192,PS4,3,232.6,235.24,2.64,1.0,I think it also applies to groups.
35192,PS4,3,235.6,238.16,2.56,1.0,So the low ranking university can be one group.
35192,PS4,3,238.64,250.76,12.12,1.0,"But for example, you know that for example, in some countries women have like girls are less educated going up the hierarchy."
35192,PS4,3,251.2,255.36,4.16,1.0,"So they, it's not exactly creative, but it's been done."
35192,PS4,3,256.0,263.92,7.92,1.0,"You know, you prioritize having a proportion of students being female versus being male."
35192,PS4,3,263.92,269.04,5.12,1.0,"And then up there, they just sort of later equalize or still shift."
35192,PS4,3,269.08,269.24,0.16,3.0,With.
35192,PS4,3,270.2,275.08,4.88,1.0,"Yeah, so the creative fight I think is the problem."
35192,PS4,3,275.08,276.56,1.48,3.0,"Yeah, that's why I'm having a problem."
35192,PS4,3,276.56,278.64,2.08,3.0,"Yeah, figuring out how to."
35192,PS4,3,282.2,287.0,4.8,1.0,Something that hasn't been done maybe?
35192,PS4,3,309.18,319.62,10.44,1.0,Maybe taking teachers or resources in whatever form from where they are highly concentrated to where they are not.
35192,PS4,3,321.22,357.2,35.98,3.0,"Yeah, that, yeah, like, I mean as part of their job, like a teaching job, you know, they have to, they should dedicate a certain number of hours every month or every week to teaching in, you know, in a separate, in another, I don't know, group like a after school group or or something, I don't know, something like that."
35192,PS4,3,373.02,389.46,16.44,2.0,"OK, I think a creative way like because we would like to encourage teachers move to the several very rural area very far the place far from city."
35192,PS4,3,390.22,400.88,10.66,2.0,So we will send a house as a gift for most students who like to teach in the in the in the rural area.
35192,PS4,3,401.56,401.68,0.12,2.0,Wow.
35192,PS4,3,401.68,403.92,2.24,2.0,We don't have much limitation here.
35192,PS4,3,404.08,407.24,3.16,2.0,"Yeah, we can send a house or we can give a house."
35192,PS4,3,408.2,447.6,39.4,3.0,"I mean, we can set up some sort of, you know, institute, not institute, but like, you know, some sort of facility where, you know, they can have that type of teaching or like session, you know, just like facilities scattered around the country that in the, in the rural areas that, you know, every, you know, every Saturday afternoon or every, you know, you know, every weekday at, you know, 3:30 or something that some students can go there and continue learning about things or get help with things like tutoring or whatever."
35192,PS4,3,452.44,468.16,15.72,3.0,"And to be honest, that'll help a lot of parents because childcare is an issue, you know, like, what do you do after your child finishes school or if they can go to this extra, you know, you know, social and educational session."
35192,PS4,3,469.56,470.64,1.08,2.0,I think yeah.
35192,PS4,3,470.8,482.44,11.64,2.0,And also we can send every student in the rural or in the low socio economic status area or situation student of iPad.
35192,PS4,3,482.44,484.08,1.64,3.0,And and.
35192,PS4,3,484.52,488.6,4.08,2.0,"Of course, lots of iPad because lots of iPad is a gift from government."
35192,PS4,3,488.6,496.08,7.48,2.0,So government can choose the available function because they are founded so they can ask for like like luck.
35192,PS4,3,496.08,510.0,13.92,2.0,"Several functions like function for entertainment, only the function for education are available for that iPad and they can attend every every online educational lecture."
35192,PS4,3,510.32,510.68,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35192,PS4,3,510.88,511.48,0.6,2.0,Maybe you?
35192,PS4,3,511.48,522.8,11.32,3.0,"Could just do an app, just an app that they can download onto any tablet or any phone and it'll have these whatever educational sessions, you know, whatever."
35192,PS4,3,522.96,525.88,2.92,2.0,"Oh, we are so kind that we can send an iPad for them that."
35192,PS4,3,526.16,527.24,1.08,3.0,"'D be nice too, I."
35192,PS4,3,529.12,529.92,0.8,2.0,Guess then they have a.
35192,PS4,3,530.6,531.36,0.76,3.0,Let me create it.
35192,PS4,3,532.04,537.92,5.88,2.0,This is a quality issue if we just have an app same one student.
35192,PS4,3,537.92,538.4,0.48,3.0,"Today, yeah."
35192,PS4,3,538.44,540.24,1.8,3.0,"Then anybody else can do it too, I mean."
35192,PS4,3,540.92,545.92,5.0,2.0,The people who have already get to the phone can attend the lecture.
35192,PS4,3,546.08,547.12,1.04,2.0,That is another equality.
35192,PS4,3,547.12,547.56,0.44,2.0,"True, true."
35192,PS4,3,547.68,548.0,0.32,3.0,True I.
35192,PS4,3,548.08,551.36,3.28,2.0,Guess the equality is every student on the best size.
35192,PS4,3,551.44,556.36,4.92,2.0,"I have nothing, then I can attend the very high quality lecture."
35192,PS4,3,557.04,565.56,8.52,2.0,"Of course we send you, we give you iPad because we are not sure whether you have such a high high quality equipment."
35192,PS4,3,565.76,566.12,0.36,2.0,"Sure, sure."
35192,PS4,3,566.72,571.4,4.68,2.0,Probably your phone is quite very old.
35192,PS4,3,571.6,575.28,3.68,2.0,Phone cannot have a high quality video.
35192,PS4,3,577.16,578.48,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, that's that's fair."
35192,PS4,3,580.16,580.48,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS4,3,605.72,611.72,6.0,2.0,Actually this idea in my knowledge is have been done by several government.
35192,PS4,3,612.04,612.44,0.4,2.0,Which one?
35192,PS4,3,613.88,614.52,0.64,1.0,The app.
35192,PS4,3,615.56,616.56,1.0,2.0,The iPad.
35192,PS4,3,619.68,628.28,8.6,1.0,"Well, yeah, I mean, it would be difficult, I think."
35192,PS4,3,628.28,629.16,0.88,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS4,3,629.64,642.76,13.12,1.0,"To provide, I mean to provide an iPad just for studies, while people need phones to communicate and they don't have that one or yeah, or they just have one for the whole house."
35192,PS4,3,643.52,649.44,5.92,3.0,And the thing about the iPads is that they would need to connect to Wi-Fi or whatever.
35192,PS4,3,649.48,651.04,1.56,2.0,"Oh yeah, it's so it's."
35192,PS4,3,651.92,656.68,4.76,3.0,"Yeah, if they're already underserved or, you know, maybe you know, low income."
35192,PS4,3,656.68,657.16,0.48,2.0,Status.
35192,PS4,3,657.52,657.96,0.44,2.0,They might not.
35192,PS4,3,657.96,660.96,3.0,3.0,Have broadband at least.
35192,PS4,3,660.96,664.04,3.08,3.0,"They might have mobile data, but maybe not broadband."
35192,PS4,3,666.52,667.08,0.56,2.0,So the the.
35192,PS4,3,667.48,668.04,0.56,3.0,"No, no, no."
35192,PS4,3,668.04,669.6,1.56,3.0,"I mean, I don't know."
35192,PS4,3,669.6,669.76,0.16,3.0,We.
35192,PS4,3,671.52,671.96,0.44,1.0,Like.
35192,PS4,3,675.68,677.52,1.84,3.0,"It's part of our whole overall idea, so."
35192,PS4,3,677.52,679.04,1.52,2.0,We create the Internet.
35192,PS4,3,679.64,681.44,1.8,2.0,We create the Internet for that area.
35192,PS4,3,682.28,683.88,1.6,2.0,We don't have a budget limitation.
35192,PS4,3,685.08,690.28,5.2,3.0,But that's what isn't Elon Musk wanted to do the Starlink in Africa or somewhere.
35192,PS4,3,691.52,695.96,4.44,3.0,"They want the Internet anywhere, you know, based on the satellite or whatever."
35192,PS4,3,695.96,696.32,0.36,3.0,"Yes, yes."
35192,PS4,3,697.08,701.32,4.24,2.0,"So, so yeah, it's still I think available or feasible."
35192,PS4,3,704.72,707.36,2.64,3.0,"OK, well, we have 15 seconds, so I think this is good enough."
35192,PS4,3,707.36,707.56,0.2,3.0,Is it?
36225,PS1,6,1.0,2.32,1.32,1.0,I'm trigger happy OK is.
36225,PS1,6,2.32,3.24,0.92,2.0,One of the biggest?
36225,PS1,6,8.28,11.12,2.84,3.0,I constantly see like creative ideas.
36225,PS1,6,11.84,12.52,0.68,1.0,On same it's.
36225,PS1,6,13.08,15.68,2.6,3.0,Like crazy things in the water going down.
36225,PS1,6,15.96,19.24,3.28,2.0,Same Are we talking about big plastics or micro?
36225,PS1,6,19.24,20.52,1.28,1.0,"Plastic, I don't think it matters."
36225,PS1,6,20.52,22.2,1.68,1.0,I think plastic is general here.
36225,PS1,6,22.56,27.48,4.92,1.0,"I've seen people and I think they're also location specific, at least in my head."
36225,PS1,6,27.48,37.44,9.96,1.0,"The types of pollution that congregate in certain areas of the world, in Africa in particular, there's a lot of like plastic in terms of like bigger plastic things."
36225,PS1,6,37.44,44.72,7.28,1.0,So I've seen organizations make houses and build as a means to also fight.
36225,PS1,6,44.88,45.72,0.84,1.0,Fight is the wrong word.
36225,PS1,6,45.72,48.72,3.0,1.0,But to Co whatever drowning.
36225,PS1,6,49.6,56.88,7.28,1.0,"So there are floatable devices and their houses basically made out of plastic that float as well to combat flooding areas and blah, blah, blah."
36225,PS1,6,56.88,57.68,0.8,1.0,Should that happen.
36225,PS1,6,57.92,75.84,17.92,1.0,"So I think there's a clear, I think my my inclination towards pollution in particular is always one that is in collaboration with the arts because I think there's a there's a, there's a clear emphasis on turning something into something."
36225,PS1,6,75.84,81.72,5.88,1.0,"So that to me reads artistically and that requires innovation in, I would hope, artistic ways."
36225,PS1,6,81.72,83.68,1.96,1.0,So that for me is something that turns out.
36225,PS1,6,83.68,83.96,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, let's."
36225,PS1,6,84.88,85.08,0.2,2.0,Do that.
36225,PS1,6,85.12,86.96,1.84,2.0,So it's a great plastic art.
36225,PS1,6,87.88,88.24,0.36,4.0,Is that right?
36225,PS1,6,89.08,89.72,0.64,1.0,I.
36225,PS1,6,89.72,90.56,0.84,5.0,Would say.
36225,PS1,6,91.6,93.56,1.96,1.0,Find Autistic.
36225,PS1,6,95.76,96.8,1.04,6.0,Inspiration from plastic are.
36225,PS1,6,98.16,105.76,7.6,3.0,"We can I ask a question, are we trying to touch this the things that are we wanting to deal with plastic mission at the kind of source or?"
36225,PS1,6,106.4,106.76,0.36,1.0,We want.
36225,PS1,6,107.04,111.16,4.12,3.0,"To deal with already polluted, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,111.48,111.68,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36225,PS1,6,111.72,131.64,19.92,4.0,"Because if we want to like, for example, like if we want to address it at the source that you'd have to like, you'd have to go for like maybe like behavioural solutions as well, like, for example, disincentivizing people to like buy plastic or like, I don't know, maybe talking about like the like social political implications."
36225,PS1,6,131.64,132.24,0.6,2.0,Of like.
36225,PS1,6,132.6,135.04,2.44,3.0,Or just like banning single use plastic?
36225,PS1,6,135.52,142.72,7.2,2.0,I have a creative idea that is increase the plastic cost because right now doing people doing that is because plastic.
36225,PS1,6,142.72,142.96,0.24,1.0,Bottles.
36225,PS1,6,142.96,143.52,0.56,1.0,It's cheap.
36225,PS1,6,143.8,144.2,0.4,1.0,It's cheap.
36225,PS1,6,144.2,152.36,8.16,2.0,"If you make it so expensive people find alternatives that I can't afford it, I'm going to why do I I'm not loyal or crazy love it in plastic."
36225,PS1,6,152.4,154.12,1.72,2.0,I just because buy it because it's cheap.
36225,PS1,6,154.12,158.92,4.8,2.0,"It's everywhere it's available and shops and packagings and using it because again, it's cheap."
36225,PS1,6,159.4,165.04,5.64,2.0,"The competitiveness, the market will bring alternatives in which because you know, I can't afford afford it anymore."
36225,PS1,6,165.52,166.04,0.52,4.0,So just.
36225,PS1,6,166.04,167.96,1.92,2.0,Increase the plastic cost?
36225,PS1,6,170.72,173.12,2.4,2.0,"No, just make the production more expensive."
36225,PS1,6,173.32,174.84,1.52,4.0,How can the production be?
36225,PS1,6,174.84,175.36,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,175.56,175.64,0.08,1.0,So.
36225,PS1,6,176.36,181.16,4.8,2.0,"Yeah, taxing a tax is one thing, but but bottom line is increase the cost of any."
36225,PS1,6,181.24,181.84,0.6,3.0,"Plastic, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,183.04,185.52,2.48,2.0,"Yeah, easiest way is is a tax."
36225,PS1,6,186.88,189.52,2.64,1.0,Sorry it just got dark and it's really missing with me.
36225,PS1,6,191.44,194.0,2.56,2.0,Tax plastic source material Plastic.
36225,PS1,6,194.32,194.76,0.44,4.0,"Material, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,194.84,197.72,2.88,4.0,"And like, what would be the alternative to like?"
36225,PS1,6,197.76,203.28,5.52,4.0,"For example, if you do succeed in like like making plastic more expensive, what would be the?"
36225,PS1,6,203.32,207.2,3.88,2.0,"Alternative, there's plenty of alternatives like our grandparents age, there's no plastic."
36225,PS1,6,207.24,211.12,3.88,2.0,"You go to the shop with a basket, we put everything in it and that's it."
36225,PS1,6,211.24,217.0,5.76,2.0,Or instead of plastic bags and you use paper bags and then dissolvable paper bags.
36225,PS1,6,217.0,222.64,5.64,2.0,And you know at some point those alternatives will be more will be cheaper than plastics.
36225,PS1,6,222.68,223.92,1.24,2.0,And then that's sorted.
36225,PS1,6,224.16,229.56,5.4,2.0,"And then the production side, which is looking at whatever it's more, more competitive."
36225,PS1,6,230.88,234.52,3.64,1.0,So tax plastic material increase.
36225,PS1,6,234.92,236.44,1.52,2.0,Cost at the source like.
36225,PS1,6,237.0,237.92,0.92,6.0,"Two, increase the cost, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,241.44,242.04,0.6,3.0,That's something.
36225,PS1,6,242.76,249.76,7.0,2.0,Maybe do you have like?

36225,PS1,6,255.88,256.32,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
36225,PS1,6,256.52,257.96,1.44,1.0,Tax plastic material.
36225,PS1,6,262.96,263.32,0.36,2.0,Day.
36225,PS1,6,265.68,266.76,1.08,3.0,"To day, is it part of the same idea?"
36225,PS1,6,266.76,268.96,2.2,3.0,Isn't by making plastic more expensive?
36225,PS1,6,269.68,270.24,0.56,1.0,Sure.
36225,PS1,6,271.36,276.36,5.0,1.0,"So are we, should we just go with tax plastic material to increase cost of plastic basically?"
36225,PS1,6,284.4,285.0,0.6,1.0,I'm so I thought.
36225,PS1,6,286.64,288.68,2.04,3.0,You meant are we going with that idea and then elaborate?
36225,PS1,6,288.72,289.68,0.96,1.0,"Oh, sorry, we can mix I."
36225,PS1,6,289.68,293.88,4.2,3.0,"Think there's more, but there's in like, I mean on the text there's in those are two different ideas, right?"
36225,PS1,6,294.08,294.76,0.68,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,294.76,295.88,1.12,5.0,So I can I can go but then.
36225,PS1,6,295.88,297.24,1.36,3.0,We could probably elaborate on it a bit more.
36225,PS1,6,298.12,298.52,0.4,1.0,OK.
36225,PS1,6,305.04,311.72,6.68,3.0,So and then which would also incentivize like innovation analysis or like any pro change?
36225,PS1,6,313.4,315.68,2.28,1.0,How do I spell incentivize again?
36225,PS1,6,316.6,318.36,1.76,1.0,Incentivize.
36225,PS1,6,318.36,322.36,4.0,1.0,Can someone please check that to incentivize?
36225,PS1,6,322.36,323.64,1.28,1.0,What alternatives like?
36225,PS1,6,323.88,324.28,0.4,3.0,Innovation.
36225,PS1,6,325.72,326.04,0.32,2.0,Incentive.
36225,PS1,6,326.2,328.16,1.96,3.0,Alternative packaging.
36225,PS1,6,336.16,336.92,0.76,1.0,There's an IMS.
36225,PS1,6,336.92,338.36,1.44,1.0,"No, I'm not going to look at it."
36225,PS1,6,342.48,343.16,0.68,1.0,Is that what you said?
36225,PS1,6,343.16,343.48,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36225,PS1,6,344.6,346.32,1.72,1.0,"Impact, influence or influence?"
36225,PS1,6,346.32,346.44,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36225,PS1,6,347.44,348.92,1.48,3.0,That's not what I like.
36225,PS1,6,350.44,353.28,2.84,1.0,"Sorry, I maybe should not be described."
36225,PS1,6,353.4,364.16,10.76,2.0,"This trend is in the way it's already happening because the very original material of making plastic is crude oil, and oil prices going up a lot compared with 20 years ago."
36225,PS1,6,364.92,374.72,9.8,2.0,"Yeah, that's why, you know, people are, you know, used to be paper packaging is more expensive, the plastic, the plastic is more durable and now it's almost the same."
36225,PS1,6,374.72,383.76,9.04,2.0,"So and that, that that encourages less manufacturing, manufacturing plastics and more people use it less."
36225,PS1,6,385.24,385.8,0.56,1.0,Are we done here?
34813,PS2,3,0.0,631.8,11.0,3.0,"OK, I'm I'm OK with that for abilities with the supply chip lean, uncontrolled costume efficiency schedules, please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security."
34813,PS2,3,631.96,633.08,1.12,3.0,"OK, OK."
34813,PS2,3,644.0,644.68,0.68,1.0,It's a tough problem.
34813,PS2,3,644.68,644.96,0.28,1.0,Well.
34813,PS2,3,645.2,646.32,1.12,3.0,It's not easy to do that.
34813,PS2,3,647.52,653.04,5.52,3.0,"People who do it PhDs on like, yeah, you know what is optimal?"
34813,PS2,3,655.0,658.92,3.92,3.0,"IO, operations, research, all that stuff."
34813,PS2,3,671.52,674.72,3.2,3.0,Chop off their tongues and any bottleneck in the chain.
34813,PS2,3,676.28,682.72,6.44,2.0,Create like a social credit for each individual and anything that they're involved in effect caused a delay to something.
34813,PS2,3,683.08,686.04,2.96,2.0,"Their social credit gets reduced, which means that they can't buy food anymore."
34813,PS2,3,686.28,686.76,0.48,3.0,I like that.
34813,PS2,3,686.76,688.44,1.68,3.0,I like the North Korean approach.
34813,PS2,3,688.44,689.0,0.56,3.0,You know it's.
34813,PS2,3,689.64,692.28,2.64,2.0,"Yeah, totally totalitarian."
34813,PS2,3,693.24,693.48,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34813,PS2,3,693.48,697.48,4.0,3.0,"I think, I think, I think it's, it's one way."
34813,PS2,3,697.52,699.24,1.72,3.0,"Yeah, I kind of like that."
34813,PS2,3,699.24,715.52,16.28,3.0,"Yeah, it was incentivized maybe like kick it up a notch and say like your family's hostage and, you know, every time you make a mistake, you know, when you're what you have a family member loses like a finger or something, you know?"
34813,PS2,3,717.44,719.96,2.52,2.0,Just remove the entire monetary system in the entire world.
34813,PS2,3,719.96,722.04,2.08,2.0,Therefore costs can be controlled.
34813,PS2,3,722.12,723.24,1.12,2.0,That removes that element.
34813,PS2,3,723.24,723.36,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34813,PS2,3,723.36,725.2,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, collapse the world."
34813,PS2,3,733.64,743.04,9.4,3.0,"And it seems to be like a common sort of strategy is just remove shipping like, you know, remove the need for a supply chain, you know, annihilate all humans, you know."
34813,PS2,3,743.76,744.92,1.16,2.0,Change the question always.
34813,PS2,3,745.52,746.08,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34813,PS2,3,747.12,748.12,1.0,3.0,That would be scary to see.
34813,PS2,3,748.12,758.36,10.24,3.0,"Like if judging these that sort of these things, you know, it's like that sort of, you know, it's like is this is this going to be a problem in a few in a few 100 years, you know, things like that already."
34813,PS2,3,760.84,763.0,2.16,1.0,"OK, that's one."
34813,PS2,3,763.04,765.6,2.56,3.0,"Creative idea, yeah."
34813,PS2,3,765.6,771.52,5.92,3.0,"The social credit thing, I think is it's not so bad, yeah."
34813,PS2,3,771.52,772.2,0.68,2.0,Let's do that.
34813,PS2,3,807.36,812.68,5.32,3.0,So with this social credit that we tied to the workers that are responsible for the supply chain or.
34813,PS2,3,813.52,813.76,0.24,1.0,But.
34813,PS2,3,814.68,821.32,6.64,2.0,"But anyone and everything so in any part, because you could almost say every single system has some sort of supply chain related to it."
34813,PS2,3,865.04,865.16,0.12,1.0,None.
34813,PS2,3,877.88,899.04,21.16,3.0,"I guess you sort of see a form of that with like current delivery services where not not like this, but I mean like when one, I guess the textbook way of dealing with this problem is really like you have like you order something, you get it free if it's like late or something, you know."
34813,PS2,3,899.04,899.72,0.68,2.0,So I think.
34813,PS2,3,900.48,903.8,3.32,3.0,"It's a type one, one of the words a purchase of items."
35414,PS5,3,8.92,12.92,4.0,1.0,"Pay them more, be a nicer boss, get them more holiday."
35414,PS5,3,14.56,14.84,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35414,PS5,3,15.96,17.76,1.8,1.0,"Like, at least in terms of legal things."
35414,PS5,3,22.04,28.44,6.4,3.0,I guess like I'd like find out like why that employee's leaving actively work.
35414,PS5,3,29.0,30.32,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, conditions."
35414,PS5,3,30.76,32.12,1.36,2.0,"Yeah, I agree."
35414,PS5,3,35.4,38.88,3.48,1.0,"Yeah, I guess ask them why and then do something to counter that."
35414,PS5,3,39.4,41.96,2.56,2.0,"Yeah, exactly like maybe we should."
35414,PS5,3,42.08,42.48,0.4,1.0,We should.
35414,PS5,3,44.16,47.4,3.24,2.0,I would put like bullet points of possible things that we could do.
35414,PS5,3,47.56,49.24,1.68,2.0,"So one of them, yeah."
35414,PS5,3,49.24,50.28,1.04,2.0,Ask them why they don't.
35414,PS5,3,50.28,56.0,5.72,1.0,"Have the salary of the more they find it a toxic work environment, try and make it nicer."
35414,PS5,3,56.64,70.28,13.64,2.0,"Yeah, so ask them why and based on the cancer try to problem solve."
35414,PS5,3,70.64,70.96,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
35414,PS5,3,73.2,73.6,0.4,2.0,If.

35414,PS5,3,75.0,82.16,7.16,2.0,Money pay pay issue I guess then raise.
35414,PS5,3,82.16,82.96,0.8,3.0,Salaries.
35414,PS5,3,84.56,85.2,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, if."
35414,PS5,3,85.28,89.32,4.04,1.0,It's like I've done everything I can in this place.

35414,PS5,3,96.36,98.32,1.96,2.0,"If it is, how would you put it in words?"
35414,PS5,3,98.64,106.0,7.36,2.0,"If it is, if it's oh, if."
35414,PS5,3,106.2,108.84,2.64,2.0,"If they are not growing in the environment, they."

35414,PS5,3,254.36,255.24,0.88,1.0,Ideas here I.
35414,PS5,3,255.56,265.72,10.16,3.0,Feel like I did like study similar to this a year or two ago and it was like like an employee isn't working as well as they should do.
35414,PS5,3,266.04,267.48,1.44,3.0,And like you could say what you were doing.
35414,PS5,3,267.48,272.36,4.88,3.0,"I was just like, oh, like I'd bring them in and ask them why aren't you performing well?"
35414,PS5,3,272.8,276.84,4.04,3.0,And then so then I got like a response back.
35414,PS5,3,276.84,278.8,1.96,3.0,It was either an AI generation or a person.
35414,PS5,3,278.8,287.96,9.16,3.0,"So I'm not sure which one it was, but they were just saying, oh, like I, I think I went to a way like, oh, maybe the company's to place to find out the company."
35414,PS5,3,287.96,293.0,5.04,3.0,"And I think they would think, well, maybe the employees to blame, like have they been doing bad things?"
35414,PS5,3,293.04,294.56,1.52,3.0,Like give them a warning first.
35414,PS5,3,296.08,299.16,3.08,1.0,"Yeah, that."
35414,PS5,3,299.16,300.52,1.36,2.0,Sounds like human generated.
35414,PS5,3,304.76,306.48,1.72,2.0,"OK, Should we go to the?"
35414,PS5,3,306.48,307.76,1.28,1.0,"Next, Yeah."
35414,PS5,3,308.08,311.96,3.88,2.0,"Yeah, Should I come up with?"
35414,PS5,3,312.32,313.52,1.2,3.0,One creative idea.
35414,PS5,3,315.0,315.16,0.16,2.0,Yeah.

35323,PS5,3,69.59,74.83,5.24,2.0,So what company can do is build some mental health program.

35323,PS5,3,233.44,235.48,2.04,2.0,"Yeah, cool."
34318,PS3,3,13.88,15.24,1.36,2.0,So maybe to help you could read aloud.
34318,PS3,3,15.24,20.44,5.2,1.0,"For us, please, yes, imagine a new pandemic has emerged that is transmitted by saying the word sorry."
34318,PS3,3,20.76,24.56,3.8,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to reduce its spread.
34318,PS3,3,25.88,27.96,2.08,2.0,That doesn't involve Canadian genocide.
34318,PS3,3,28.04,30.2,2.16,1.0,"Just one idea, sorry, is that could be."
34318,PS3,3,30.28,31.04,0.76,2.0,Or sorry.
34318,PS3,3,31.52,31.76,0.24,3.0,It's.
34318,PS3,3,33.36,36.2,2.84,1.0,It's an accent wise thing in every language.
34318,PS3,3,36.2,36.36,0.16,1.0,Oh yeah.
34318,PS3,3,37.72,37.96,0.24,2.0,You could.
34318,PS3,3,38.04,38.32,0.28,2.0,You could.
34318,PS3,3,38.64,40.12,1.48,1.0,You could outlaw English.
34318,PS3,3,40.24,41.28,1.04,1.0,You could outlaw English.
34318,PS3,3,42.0,44.08,2.08,2.0,But outlawing doesn't prevent it's usage.
34318,PS3,3,44.16,44.28,0.12,2.0,I'm.
34318,PS3,3,44.28,45.36,1.08,3.0,Concerning to the loose.
34318,PS3,3,47.08,47.56,0.48,1.0,"Well, both."
34318,PS3,3,47.96,49.48,1.52,2.0,"Right, like we've outlawed murder."
34318,PS3,3,49.88,50.88,1.0,2.0,Murder still occurs.
34318,PS3,3,51.28,54.96,3.68,1.0,"Yes, but it's certainly reduced relative to when you'd have otherwise pandemic, right."
34318,PS3,3,55.0,56.64,1.64,1.0,My murders tendencies of course are.
34318,PS3,3,57.52,60.92,3.4,2.0,"Sorry, is the look at me using the word already?"
34318,PS3,3,61.36,66.08,4.72,2.0,Is is the infection caused by the use of the word sorry?
34318,PS3,3,66.44,69.68,3.24,1.0,So it says is transmitted by saying the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,70.6,73.84,3.24,2.0,"So if I say sorry in your presence, I transmit the disease to."
34318,PS3,3,73.84,74.64,0.8,1.0,You I assume so.
34318,PS3,3,74.68,78.16,3.48,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, or I get the boy."
34318,PS3,3,78.44,79.56,1.12,1.0,"He didn't last long, did he?"
34318,PS3,3,79.84,80.36,0.52,2.0,"No, he didn't."
34318,PS3,3,82.48,102.4,19.92,2.0,"This is a peculiar question because saying the word sorry either do you have to hear the word sorry, which would require also scrubbing like audio and written references, And is it the meaning of the word sorry or is it literally the English word sorry?"
34318,PS3,3,102.4,105.12,2.72,1.0,"Look, I'd say we take it narrows saying the word sorry."
34318,PS3,3,105.28,107.52,2.24,1.0,So a human has to say the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,107.6,110.32,2.72,2.0,"And then they become infected, or they infect those that hurt it."
34318,PS3,3,112.36,115.68,3.32,1.0,"I assume it's transmitted, so you are already."
34318,PS3,3,116.76,118.72,1.96,1.0,"Oh yeah, you're right, you does."
34318,PS3,3,118.72,119.2,0.48,1.0,Just saying.
34318,PS3,3,119.2,120.24,1.04,2.0,Transmitted to the.
34318,PS3,3,120.64,125.84,5.2,1.0,"Vessel, I'm guessing you have to be like patient zero and the first time you say sorry, then it goes to the next who?"
34318,PS3,3,125.84,127.12,1.28,2.0,"Hears it, yes."
34318,PS3,3,127.4,128.24,0.84,1.0,That would be my guess.
34318,PS3,3,128.24,129.04,0.8,1.0,I would take that as an.
34318,PS3,3,129.04,129.4,0.36,2.0,Essential.
34318,PS3,3,129.44,131.92,2.48,2.0,I think that's a reasonable presumption.
34318,PS3,3,132.28,137.28,5.0,1.0,"Also, what if we electronically like just filter the word sorry or everybody wears your phones?"
34318,PS3,3,137.28,139.6,2.32,2.0,"Mute everyone, just cut their vocal cords."
34318,PS3,3,139.6,140.6,1.0,1.0,That would be beautiful.
34318,PS3,3,140.72,142.52,1.8,2.0,"OK, so we're going for creativity."
34318,PS3,3,142.52,145.08,2.56,1.0,"We're going for creativity, not a good solution."
34318,PS3,3,145.8,153.44,7.64,2.0,"OK, so people's use of the English language is largely instinctual, right?"
34318,PS3,3,153.44,158.4,4.96,2.0,"You don't plan your sentence in conversationally, at least as you're speaking it."
34318,PS3,3,158.4,160.04,1.64,2.0,It just facilitate.
34318,PS3,3,160.04,173.72,13.68,2.0,"So there's already hundreds of millions of English speakers who've already got sorry programmed into their and so even trying hard, you're going to have rampant usage."
34318,PS3,3,173.76,174.92,1.16,1.0,Of the word yes.
34318,PS3,3,175.96,179.72,3.76,2.0,So there's a couple.
34318,PS3,3,179.84,182.8,2.96,2.0,So let's break the function down.
34318,PS3,3,182.84,186.32,3.48,2.0,There's audio transmission of the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,186.32,189.44,3.12,2.0,"So there's like sound, there's gap, right?"
34318,PS3,3,189.44,201.76,12.32,2.0,"There's sound waves when you could stop the transmission by by distancing people, but electronic communication and shouting and things like that make that difficult."
34318,PS3,3,203.04,206.44,3.4,2.0,There's you like your actual generation of the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,206.88,216.36,9.48,2.0,"Which is problematic as well, because people are going to do it even if you heavily disincentivize the usage of the."
34318,PS3,3,216.36,216.52,0.16,1.0,Word.
34318,PS3,3,216.52,218.6,2.08,1.0,"Yes, it'll spread, Yes."
34318,PS3,3,220.08,228.0,7.92,2.0,There's the actual human emotion that generates usage of the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,228.0,234.16,6.16,2.0,"So first there's something that would cause you to use the word sorry, either regret or politeness or manners."
34318,PS3,3,234.92,240.0,5.08,2.0,"There's the actual vocalization of sorry, and there's the act of transmission of sorry."
34318,PS3,3,240.0,242.08,2.08,2.0,And then there's you hearing the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,243.36,247.32,3.96,2.0,And those are all potential points of disruption.
34318,PS3,3,247.88,248.44,0.56,1.0,Yes.
34318,PS3,3,249.08,249.44,0.36,2.0,Right.
34318,PS3,3,249.92,257.92,8.0,2.0,Like we could go around and poke sharp sticks in everybody's ears so that they just are all deaf and we can never hear the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,257.92,258.6,0.68,1.0,That will be very.
34318,PS3,3,258.64,260.32,1.68,2.0,"Easy, yes, and that."
34318,PS3,3,260.44,261.52,1.08,1.0,Would cut out everyone's tongue.
34318,PS3,3,261.56,263.92,2.36,2.0,"So, so let's let's just talk about it, OK?"
34318,PS3,3,263.92,266.36,2.44,2.0,"No, no, no, just the ears, not the tongues, OK."
34318,PS3,3,266.6,267.04,0.44,1.0,"Well, either."
34318,PS3,3,267.12,269.08,1.96,2.0,One that would be over in a generation.
34318,PS3,3,271.12,271.56,0.44,1.0,People would.
34318,PS3,3,271.56,272.96,1.4,2.0,Regain the ability to hear.
34318,PS3,3,273.04,279.08,6.04,1.0,"Yeah, if this is so bad, well, we don't know how bad the disease is, but assume the disease is bad enough, it might be worth it, right?"
34318,PS3,3,279.12,279.96,0.84,1.0,We just do that.
34318,PS3,3,280.28,284.84,4.56,2.0,"Well, we're just trying to prevent it doesn't say yeah, it's like prevent."
34318,PS3,3,284.84,285.72,0.88,1.0,"Yeah, we're trying to be creative."
34318,PS3,3,285.76,286.68,0.92,1.0,"Yeah, I agree."
34318,PS3,3,286.96,287.2,0.24,2.0,Right.
34318,PS3,3,287.2,292.68,5.48,2.0,"So you can disrupt at several points in that chain of events, right?"
34318,PS3,3,292.72,293.6,0.88,2.0,You can.
34318,PS3,3,295.88,302.12,6.24,2.0,"You can forbid, you know, legally or health authorities or whatever the use of the words are."
34318,PS3,3,302.12,304.32,2.2,1.0,"That'll do some, but not enough probably."
34318,PS3,3,304.68,306.64,1.96,2.0,You can scrub usage.
34318,PS3,3,306.84,310.6,3.76,2.0,What do the Romans call it at in memoriam when they punish you?
34318,PS3,3,310.6,312.6,2.0,2.0,"Oh, obliteration or something like that."
34318,PS3,3,312.64,313.72,1.08,1.0,Or you may strike.
34318,PS3,3,313.72,314.6,0.88,2.0,Your name from every written.
34318,PS3,3,314.6,314.84,0.24,2.0,What do?
34318,PS3,3,314.84,315.92,1.08,1.0,You mean like in Soviet Russia?
34318,PS3,3,316.44,317.4,0.96,2.0,Do they do the same thing?
34318,PS3,3,317.4,319.6,2.2,1.0,"Yeah, Trotsky got painted out of pictures and stuff."
34318,PS3,3,319.8,320.88,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
34318,PS3,3,321.08,330.44,9.36,2.0,So we could we can SO11 arm of this could be to scrub usage of the word sorry or to replace.
34318,PS3,3,330.44,331.44,1.0,2.0,Probably not scrub.
34318,PS3,3,331.48,332.68,1.2,2.0,You wouldn't blank it out.
34318,PS3,3,333.12,333.48,0.36,2.0,You would.
34318,PS3,3,333.76,335.96,2.2,2.0,You would create a different word.
34318,PS3,3,336.76,340.08,3.32,1.0,"OK, well, well, how about exactly you'd have to do that?"
34318,PS3,3,341.48,343.08,1.6,1.0,"But thinking create, wouldn't it be easier?"
34318,PS3,3,343.08,350.8,7.72,1.0,"Can't we program, can't we have AI just use like noise cancelling earphones that filter only sorry, wouldn't that solve your problem?"
34318,PS3,3,351.2,351.36,0.16,1.0,So.
34318,PS3,3,351.36,356.04,4.68,2.0,"OK, let's talk to 8 billion people, 8 billion sets of noise cancelling."
34318,PS3,3,356.04,357.6,1.56,1.0,"No, you don't need 8 billion people."
34318,PS3,3,357.64,359.96,2.32,1.0,You need English speakers in various.
34318,PS3,3,359.96,361.4,1.44,2.0,"No, no, you need for the headphones."
34318,PS3,3,361.4,362.56,1.16,2.0,You need people who can.
34318,PS3,3,362.56,362.96,0.4,1.0,Hear.
34318,PS3,3,363.16,364.76,1.6,1.0,"True, but we're not talking about how."
34318,PS3,3,364.76,367.64,2.88,2.0,Likely people to hear English that's.
34318,PS3,3,368.8,369.08,0.28,1.0,We're not.
34318,PS3,3,369.16,370.36,1.2,1.0,We're trying to be creative here.
34318,PS3,3,370.36,372.04,1.68,1.0,We're not actually trying to solve the problem.
34318,PS3,3,372.04,372.96,0.92,1.0,"You realize that, right?"
34318,PS3,3,373.92,376.04,2.12,2.0,We're trying to be creative in solving the problem.
34318,PS3,3,376.04,377.56,1.52,3.0,We have to solve the problem in the best way.
34318,PS3,3,377.6,378.12,0.52,3.0,"No, we don't."
34318,PS3,3,378.36,379.0,0.64,1.0,That's not what it says.
34318,PS3,3,379.12,379.68,0.56,1.0,Be creative.
34318,PS3,3,380.52,387.84,7.32,2.0,"So OK, noise cancelling, headphones poking eardrums out, substituting a different word for the word sorry."
34318,PS3,3,388.0,388.32,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
34318,PS3,3,391.84,400.24,8.4,2.0,"There's also another potential leg of this which is like, is it the phonetic vocalization of the word sorry, or is in the intent to say?"
34318,PS3,3,400.24,400.84,0.6,1.0,The word that.
34318,PS3,3,400.84,403.0,2.16,1.0,That's what I was asked because I was wondering before.
34318,PS3,3,403.24,408.16,4.92,2.0,I named my dog Saw like SAWRH EE.
34318,PS3,3,408.28,409.72,1.44,1.0,"Oh, like in all of Japan now?"
34318,PS3,3,409.72,410.2,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, like."
34318,PS3,3,414.08,420.56,6.48,2.0,"But so like you have to both there's transmission, vocalization and reception and those are all potential."
34318,PS3,3,420.56,423.12,2.56,1.0,Points where you and that's where we could like block basically so.
34318,PS3,3,423.28,429.08,5.8,2.0,"I don't know how you you'd reduce transmission once the sound is produced, before it's heard."
34318,PS3,3,429.08,430.12,1.04,2.0,I don't know how you destroy it.
34318,PS3,3,430.24,432.88,2.64,2.0,You just set off explosions constantly.
34318,PS3,3,432.88,433.28,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34318,PS3,3,433.52,435.64,2.12,1.0,I was thinking of that like you'd white noise on.
34318,PS3,3,436.6,437.76,1.16,2.0,Speak loud speakers.
34318,PS3,3,438.44,439.48,1.04,1.0,Everywhere if this.
34318,PS3,3,439.48,440.16,0.68,3.0,Is quite serious.
34318,PS3,3,440.24,442.28,2.04,3.0,"Nice, I have a solution."
34318,PS3,3,442.88,444.88,2.0,3.0,We all get mic.
34318,PS3,3,445.24,446.8,1.56,3.0,Everyone has to have a mic 8.
34318,PS3,3,446.8,447.48,0.68,2.0,Billion people.
34318,PS3,3,447.56,447.88,0.32,1.0,I thought.
34318,PS3,3,447.88,449.24,1.36,1.0,"I thought that too, yeah."
34318,PS3,3,449.64,457.84,8.2,2.0,You just with the existing factories that produce microphones for 8 billion people constantly that people will mandatorily wear all the time.
34318,PS3,3,458.04,460.16,2.12,2.0,I think that the government's tracking them.
34318,PS3,3,460.24,460.92,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
34318,PS3,3,461.64,469.8,8.16,3.0,"And as soon as someone you use machine that oh, it's, it's easy to pick up as soon as someone says, sorry, the police is there."
34318,PS3,3,470.76,471.56,0.8,1.0,"Oh yeah, that doesn't help you."
34318,PS3,3,471.56,472.48,0.92,1.0,They're 16 billion.
34318,PS3,3,472.6,473.32,0.72,1.0,They're already infected.
34318,PS3,3,473.32,473.48,0.16,1.0,There's.
34318,PS3,3,473.48,477.44,3.96,2.0,16 billion police officers who follow around the 8 billion inhabitants of Earth.
34318,PS3,3,479.16,480.12,0.96,2.0,"OK, how about this?"
34318,PS3,3,480.12,480.24,0.12,3.0,OK.
34318,PS3,3,480.48,483.84,3.36,3.0,"I'm just saying the police is there, they lock you up so that if you do say sorry."
34318,PS3,3,484.6,487.56,2.96,2.0,Legalize murder for people who said the word sorry.
34318,PS3,3,488.2,489.12,0.92,3.0,So we outsource it.
34318,PS3,3,489.28,489.88,0.6,2.0,Is what you said.
34318,PS3,3,490.0,491.28,1.28,2.0,We just legalize murder.
34318,PS3,3,491.64,500.56,8.92,2.0,We poke everybody's eardrums out and we introduce a new word to take the place of sorry resolve.
34318,PS3,3,500.88,503.32,2.44,3.0,"No, but introducing the new word is a bit."
34318,PS3,3,503.48,504.36,0.88,2.0,"Ari, say people."
34318,PS3,3,504.6,507.04,2.44,3.0,"Be like, oh what can I say sorry for now and then."
34318,PS3,3,508.76,510.52,1.76,2.0,"No, you just make it pig Latin Ari say."

36105,PS1,6,14.12,15.88,1.76,1.0,Is it one idea that's not already happening?
36105,PS1,6,16.76,16.8,0.04,1.0,A.
36105,PS1,6,16.8,17.76,0.96,2.0,New idea or just?
36105,PS1,6,19.56,20.48,0.92,3.0,"Yeah, OK."
36105,PS1,6,20.52,22.68,2.16,3.0,So I think it must be a.
36105,PS1,6,22.68,28.8,6.12,4.0,New idea.
36105,PS1,6,31.88,32.36,0.48,3.0,What is the?
36105,PS1,6,33.64,33.68,0.04,4.0,I.
36105,PS1,6,35.04,37.68,2.64,5.0,Mean I think the the main technique.
36105,PS1,6,37.68,38.12,0.44,4.0,Is recycle.
36105,PS1,6,38.84,46.6,7.76,5.0,Recycle to different depends on what you want to channel the the waste.
36105,PS1,6,49.04,49.24,0.2,3.0,Inside.
36105,PS1,6,50.04,53.88,3.84,5.0,That you can think around.
36105,PS1,6,58.2,58.32,0.12,4.0,That.
36105,PS1,6,59.84,60.36,0.52,3.0,Poo bags.
36105,PS1,6,61.08,61.56,0.48,1.0,Paper bags.
36105,PS1,6,61.56,63.12,1.56,2.0,Or instead of just like using alternate.
36105,PS1,6,63.12,63.56,0.44,3.0,Materials.
36105,PS1,6,63.56,65.12,1.56,2.0,Instead of plastic in the first place.
36105,PS1,6,66.84,70.32,3.48,1.0,"So, but I guess that's not the other with the book, I said."
36105,PS1,6,71.92,72.56,0.64,3.0,Plastic wage.
36105,PS1,6,72.56,74.24,1.68,3.0,Why is it such a big issue?
36105,PS1,6,74.24,74.44,0.2,3.0,Because.
36105,PS1,6,76.2,79.32,3.12,5.0,It's not degradable actually.
36105,PS1,6,79.44,80.44,1.0,5.0,"Yeah, OK."
36105,PS1,6,81.52,86.8,5.28,5.0,"So rather than using that, you can use paper bags that are a little degradable."
36105,PS1,6,90.44,91.64,1.2,3.0,But is it just bad or just?
36105,PS1,6,92.16,92.44,0.28,2.0,Like for.
36105,PS1,6,92.44,92.76,0.32,1.0,Example.
36105,PS1,6,93.0,95.32,2.32,3.0,"One of the things that we use plastic, So what what?"
36105,PS1,6,95.36,96.44,1.08,3.0,What is plastic waste?
36105,PS1,6,97.36,99.4,2.04,5.0,Sorry to it includes a lot of objects.
36105,PS1,6,100.28,100.6,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,102.44,105.04,2.6,5.0,You mean the sachet?
36105,PS1,6,106.8,107.24,0.44,4.0,"Water, water."
36105,PS1,6,107.24,109.24,2.0,5.0,"Bottle, yeah."
36105,PS1,6,109.72,111.0,1.28,3.0,So it's temporary use.
36105,PS1,6,111.84,112.24,0.4,2.0,Doesn't it?
36105,PS1,6,112.4,116.56,4.16,3.0,"So it's convenience, yeah, temporary use."
36105,PS1,6,117.4,120.2,2.8,1.0,"But like you're saying about the paper bag, so it's just like removing the."
36105,PS1,6,120.2,123.36,3.16,2.0,"Production of plastic, which therefore prevents plastic pollution."
36105,PS1,6,123.36,125.8,2.44,2.0,"If you don't have it being produced, you're not going to have it as waste."
36105,PS1,6,126.36,127.08,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, so just."
36105,PS1,6,127.12,127.48,0.36,2.0,Like.
36105,PS1,6,130.24,132.2,1.96,3.0,"Yeah, so."
36105,PS1,6,133.56,135.52,1.96,1.0,Another I know this is a very coercive and it.
36105,PS1,6,135.52,136.88,1.36,2.0,"Already happens, but you have like."
36105,PS1,6,136.88,138.28,1.4,1.0,Plastic credit markets so like.
36105,PS1,6,138.28,141.56,3.28,2.0,Financial incentives to stop big companies producing but it.
36105,PS1,6,141.56,142.2,0.64,1.0,Also.
36105,PS1,6,142.52,148.12,5.6,2.0,"It's like a financial means of encouraging recycling, which therefore reduces plastic pollution."
36105,PS1,6,149.52,149.88,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,150.56,153.56,3.0,1.0,We only need to.
36105,PS1,6,153.56,154.6,1.04,2.0,Come up with one idea.
36105,PS1,6,155.28,157.52,2.24,1.0,So we just go into one of those 3.
36105,PS1,6,157.52,159.0,1.48,2.0,Things and find something creative.
36105,PS1,6,159.12,159.52,0.4,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,160.24,162.8,2.56,3.0,So do we want to stop it at the source?
36105,PS1,6,162.88,164.72,1.84,3.0,So do we want to not make it at all?
36105,PS1,6,165.08,165.28,0.2,2.0,And.
36105,PS1,6,165.28,169.72,4.44,3.0,Change the what we use or do we want the trade off for using it?
36105,PS1,6,169.72,174.88,5.16,3.0,"I don't know or to limit usage, I don't think we could completely eliminate it."
36105,PS1,6,174.88,180.88,6.0,3.0,But I guess what are the what are the biggest weight bottles is a big one bottle is huge.
36105,PS1,6,186.2,195.96,9.76,6.0,I'm looking at extending the lifespan because any single use or temporary use probably creates a much larger quantities of it.
36105,PS1,6,196.32,196.96,0.64,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,197.2,211.76,14.56,6.0,"So if you can probably think towards increasing lifespans, or if alternately, not increased lifespans but somehow think of converting that or recycling or reusing it."
36105,PS1,6,213.32,213.6,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,214.24,217.28,3.04,6.0,Multiple uses for the same piece of plastic.
36105,PS1,6,217.84,219.8,1.96,6.0,"If you can somehow think along those lines, yeah."
36105,PS1,6,220.44,221.56,1.12,3.0,I guess it's kind of a habit.
36105,PS1,6,221.68,228.88,7.2,3.0,"I think like if we didn't have reusable, if we didn't have these things, we wouldn't throw them away in the way that we do."
36105,PS1,6,228.88,236.44,7.56,3.0,"I think it's like a cultural thing where we just assume something's temporary so we throw it away, whereas if we can change that behaviour."
36105,PS1,6,237.12,240.84,3.72,6.0,If you can somehow make plastic bottles expensive.
36105,PS1,6,242.2,247.04,4.84,1.0,"If we just also doing that, we could say that though, we could say that we just tack."
36105,PS1,6,247.04,250.0,2.96,2.0,"Single use plastic, yeah."
36105,PS1,6,250.0,251.16,1.16,1.0,"Like a sugar tacks, but."
36105,PS1,6,252.36,254.48,2.12,4.0,"Actually, people don't want to use super much, you know."
36105,PS1,6,254.92,255.44,0.52,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,255.72,272.2,16.48,6.0,"So it can work too is either like buying a new bottle can be more expensive or secondly, if as an organization, as an individual, if you are generating plastic waste, the disposal costs are so high that you will be incentivized to find an alternate recycling."
36105,PS1,6,273.16,274.2,1.04,1.0,Method or you could have.
36105,PS1,6,274.2,277.12,2.92,2.0,"Like in Germany, they pay you to recycle plastic bottles."
36105,PS1,6,279.32,280.12,0.8,1.0,We've only got 7.
36105,PS1,6,280.12,280.64,0.52,2.0,Minutes.
36105,PS1,6,281.12,282.76,1.64,3.0,So it's more like the waste disposal.
36105,PS1,6,282.88,286.0,3.12,3.0,Maybe we can make so plastic waste.
36105,PS1,6,286.88,290.96,4.08,3.0,So there's waste that doesn't get processed properly and then there's waste that does get processed properly.
36105,PS1,6,291.16,293.76,2.6,3.0,"If all the waste got processed properly, would it be a problem?"
36105,PS1,6,293.76,295.36,1.6,2.0,"No, so it wouldn't be plastic pollution."
36105,PS1,6,296.16,296.92,0.76,3.0,"OK, so."
36105,PS1,6,298.24,298.4,0.16,2.0,Sorry.
36105,PS1,6,299.32,302.0,2.68,4.0,"Do we have a sudden problem, not actually a knitting problem?"
36105,PS1,6,303.64,304.08,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,304.6,306.76,2.16,4.0,So the following is is what do you get to see?
36105,PS1,6,306.76,307.88,1.12,4.0,So how do you come up?
36105,PS1,6,307.92,308.64,0.72,4.0,How do you reduce?
36105,PS1,6,308.64,311.72,3.08,4.0,It's not like it needed entirely.
36105,PS1,6,312.8,319.84,7.04,4.0,"So I think we did pay to recycle attacks and grades, I think."
36105,PS1,6,319.88,321.36,1.48,4.0,I think those two are better.
36105,PS1,6,321.8,321.92,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,322.84,332.44,9.6,4.0,"Because if everyone is more about making money when you like pack plastics and get money for it, we want to like either hold or noise at all."
36105,PS1,6,333.88,337.16,3.28,1.0,"Yeah, I think just extend it because like you know how a plastic bag used to."
36105,PS1,6,337.16,338.44,1.28,2.0,Be free and now we have to pay.
36105,PS1,6,338.44,339.4,0.96,1.0,For them just like.
36105,PS1,6,339.4,341.4,2.0,2.0,Extending that to all single use plastic.
36105,PS1,6,341.4,341.72,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,342.6,343.76,1.16,2.0,With like a common tags.
36105,PS1,6,343.96,345.44,1.48,3.0,"OK, but then what would we use as an autistic?"
36105,PS1,6,346.88,347.2,0.32,1.0,We don't.
36105,PS1,6,347.2,347.4,0.2,2.0,Have to.
36105,PS1,6,347.4,348.44,1.04,1.0,"At that point, because then."
36105,PS1,6,348.48,350.8,2.32,2.0,"You're saying that by taxing people, people are going to buy it?"
36105,PS1,6,350.8,351.04,0.24,2.0,Let's.
36105,PS1,6,352.4,353.72,1.32,4.0,Talk about people.
36105,PS1,6,354.0,354.24,0.24,1.0,"Bag, Yeah."
36105,PS1,6,355.84,356.28,0.44,5.0,"People, yeah."
36105,PS1,6,357.04,357.16,0.12,6.0,But.
36105,PS1,6,357.76,358.04,0.28,4.0,You're not?
36105,PS1,6,358.36,358.6,0.24,4.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,358.92,363.08,4.16,6.0,"Basically, you own the cloth bag, so it's like one of your possessions."
36105,PS1,6,363.08,364.04,0.96,6.0,You own it in your house.
36105,PS1,6,364.08,365.68,1.6,6.0,"Yeah, and every time steps of."
36105,PS1,6,366.72,368.0,1.28,4.0,The could we could.
36105,PS1,6,368.0,372.48,4.48,3.0,"We make other materials cheaper, so if we made cloth."
36105,PS1,6,372.72,373.04,0.32,4.0,Cheaper.
36105,PS1,6,373.24,377.28,4.04,3.0,"Yeah, and then plastic more expensive, then it's the obvious choice."
36105,PS1,6,377.56,380.68,3.12,3.0,So we need to make other options more attractive.
36105,PS1,6,380.68,382.32,1.64,4.0,"Attractive and cheaper, yeah."
36105,PS1,6,383.88,384.84,0.96,3.0,So then maybe.
36105,PS1,6,386.04,388.08,2.04,6.0,Let's try and finalise one idea.
36105,PS1,6,388.48,390.6,2.12,4.0,"OK, I think the idea of making a lot too far."
36105,PS1,6,390.84,392.44,1.6,1.0,Is better How?
36105,PS1,6,392.44,395.92,3.48,2.0,Are you going to do that because then your government would have to subsidise everything?
36105,PS1,6,396.16,396.92,0.76,2.0,"Yeah, like."
36105,PS1,6,397.24,397.92,0.68,1.0,Putting a tax.
36105,PS1,6,397.92,402.12,4.2,2.0,On plastic will naturally make the other things more attractive without having to make them cheaper.
36105,PS1,6,402.44,402.84,0.4,3.0,OK.
36105,PS1,6,403.36,403.76,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, big."
36105,PS1,6,405.2,406.32,1.12,4.0,Tax in plastic too.
36105,PS1,6,406.52,409.36,2.84,1.0,"Yeah, I."
36105,PS1,6,409.44,409.8,0.36,2.0,Think it's.
36105,PS1,6,409.8,410.32,0.52,1.0,"Fine, So what?"
36105,PS1,6,410.8,411.72,0.92,3.0,Do you want to put down?
36105,PS1,6,412.52,413.32,0.8,4.0,Tax on plastics.
36105,PS1,6,413.6,415.92,2.32,1.0,"Yeah, so like kind of mirroring the sugar tugs."
36105,PS1,6,422.12,423.72,1.6,6.0,"Yeah, we have two more minutes to think."
36105,PS1,6,426.36,426.48,0.12,6.0,Yes.
36105,PS1,6,427.52,428.6,1.08,1.0,Everyone wants to have it up.
36105,PS1,6,428.6,428.8,0.2,1.0,We need.
36105,PS1,6,429.96,430.24,0.28,5.0,To right now.
36105,PS1,6,431.04,432.48,1.44,3.0,"Yeah, yes, we just."
36105,PS1,6,432.48,433.4,0.92,1.0,Within the next 5 minutes.
36105,PS1,6,433.72,434.36,0.64,3.0,We have one crazy.
36105,PS1,6,434.68,437.0,2.32,6.0,Idea like we we have to agree on yeah.
36105,PS1,6,437.76,438.64,0.88,1.0,We all agreed on that.
36105,PS1,6,439.28,440.24,0.96,4.0,Tax in 5-6.
36105,PS1,6,440.56,442.04,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, I'm going to have that."
36105,PS1,6,442.36,443.0,0.64,1.0,Does anyone not?
36105,PS1,6,444.52,444.96,0.44,4.0,Against.
36105,PS1,6,445.16,445.68,0.52,4.0,Who's against?
36105,PS1,6,448.72,451.04,2.32,6.0,"But is it, is it innovative?"
36105,PS1,6,451.04,456.92,5.88,6.0,"Isn't like when we mentioned plastic bags, If you now want to buy them at grocery stores, you have to pay."
36105,PS1,6,457.32,460.12,2.8,6.0,"Isn't that in a way, a tax on plastic usage?"
36105,PS1,6,460.12,460.32,0.2,6.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,460.36,463.0,2.64,1.0,"But like, I think we're just saying that we're extending that idea."
36105,PS1,6,463.08,463.64,0.56,2.0,To like.
36105,PS1,6,463.92,469.12,5.2,6.0,"OK, how?"
36105,PS1,6,469.16,470.2,1.04,1.0,Many did they say that you have?
36105,PS1,6,470.2,471.08,0.88,1.0,Do you have any questions?
36105,PS1,6,472.04,473.6,1.56,6.0,3 Three such questions.
36105,PS1,6,473.6,474.6,1.0,6.0,This is the first.
36105,PS1,6,477.84,478.88,1.04,6.0,Should we elaborate?
36105,PS1,6,478.88,478.92,0.04,6.0,A.
36105,PS1,6,478.92,480.36,1.44,1.0,Little like tax.
36105,PS1,6,480.44,481.56,1.12,2.0,On single use.
36105,PS1,6,483.68,484.04,0.36,1.0,Plastic.
36105,PS1,6,491.91,495.47,3.56,4.0,Making alternative places more attractive and.
36105,PS1,6,495.87,496.23,0.36,2.0,Cheaper.
36105,PS1,6,500.47,510.76,10.29,6.0,"We can probably link it and say tax on single use plastic, which will help to subsidise the adoption of other materials."
36105,PS1,6,516.12,519.76,3.64,2.0,"When you could use the revenue that you should gain from the tax, you can."
36105,PS1,6,519.76,520.56,0.8,1.0,Invest in like.
36105,PS1,6,520.6,523.0,2.4,2.0,Further recycling facilities.
36105,PS1,6,546.04,554.48,8.44,6.0,Any other examples like we mentioned cloth bags or you have some agriculture produce like jute bags or?
36105,PS1,6,554.8,555.0,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS1,6,560.52,561.72,1.2,6.0,"Jute, paper, etcetera."
36105,PS1,6,568.6,569.36,0.76,6.0,Anything else?
36105,PS1,6,571.16,572.16,1.0,1.0,You could write something.
36105,PS1,6,572.16,574.24,2.08,2.0,About the revenue that you get from this?
36105,PS1,6,574.36,574.68,0.32,1.0,Could be.
36105,PS1,6,574.68,576.68,2.0,2.0,Invested into further recycling.
36105,PS1,6,576.68,579.04,2.36,1.0,Facilities just to make it very close.
36105,PS1,6,580.44,581.24,0.8,4.0,That's OK.
36105,PS1,6,581.24,587.84,6.6,4.0,That's that's it from it is we're using recycling.
36105,PS1,6,599.32,601.2,1.88,6.0,Recycling facilities for plastic.
36105,PS1,6,620.52,621.24,0.72,6.0,"Yeah, we can."
36105,PS1,6,622.08,623.92,1.84,6.0,We can finish it off if we are OK with this.
36105,PS1,6,627.04,628.32,1.28,6.0,Anything else or should we move?
34348,PS1,3,0.0,901.16,8.72,3.0,"Oh grammily, plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime."
34348,PS1,3,901.68,906.0,4.32,3.0,Please come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic pollution.
34348,PS1,3,906.2,906.76,0.56,2.0,Ban it.
34348,PS1,3,907.72,916.2,8.48,1.0,"So this is actually this I heard from somebody who actually works in this, yes, their GCP with Patagonia and now is like with climate something."
34348,PS1,3,917.24,927.2,9.96,1.0,"So what he looked at was specifically like the plastic bags that come with packaging, like shipping materials."
34348,PS1,3,927.48,933.72,6.24,1.0,"He goes, you need these to keep these clean, keep these fresh, efficient, protected, yada yada."
34348,PS1,3,934.0,941.44,7.44,1.0,"He goes, the part where we lose control of the plot is when we distribute those shipping those things within."
34348,PS1,3,942.4,950.36,7.96,1.0,"Because for example, if we go from like, I don't know, like let's say a cotton mill, then it has to send material, raw materials to like the factory, the factory that has to go send it to."
34348,PS1,3,950.68,954.72,4.04,1.0,They're sending classic bags all throughout between themselves internally.
34348,PS1,3,955.04,959.32,4.28,1.0,"He goes, So what it is is like we have to make sure it stays within our control."
34348,PS1,3,960.0,961.08,1.08,1.0,That's our best bet.
34348,PS1,3,961.44,965.4,3.96,1.0,So we use plastic only internally within the company to ship those materials.
34348,PS1,3,965.68,972.6,6.92,1.0,"Then before it gets distributed, we switch it for paper, for cardboard, for no nothing at all."
34348,PS1,3,972.6,976.44,3.84,1.0,"Just like the box, a nice box itself and go get in, get out."
34348,PS1,3,976.76,980.72,3.96,3.0,"Wait, doesn't mean that it's it's messed up because like when?"
34348,PS1,3,980.92,981.76,0.84,3.0,During the cycle.
34348,PS1,3,981.92,983.24,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, and also during the production."
34348,PS1,3,983.32,994.96,11.64,3.0,"Oh, So what that person is saying that during the production process it's OK to use plastic because it's properly recycled industrially, but in consumer the end phase they don't?"
34348,PS1,3,994.96,1002.64,7.68,1.0,Know that's how it leads to pollution yes that's how it leads to waste OK because otherwise they can easily recycle it melt it down and then it's a really bad and.
34348,PS1,3,1002.72,1008.44,5.72,2.0,Like then like every plastic you put you will get paid back this much amount so.
34348,PS1,3,1009.28,1010.12,0.84,1.0,That's true.
34348,PS1,3,1010.64,1012.44,1.8,1.0,"That's that's what I do, yeah."
34348,PS1,3,1013.04,1014.6,1.56,2.0,Go and like dump it somewhere.
34348,PS1,3,1014.84,1015.4,0.56,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS1,3,1015.4,1032.52,17.12,1.0,"I think it's like, like, think about the way that plastic cans, for example, what they said was the plastic product that for years was the most like recycled disposable cameras because in order to get it developed, you have to return it and then they recycle it for you."
34348,PS1,3,1033.0,1034.16,1.16,1.0,So it's I guess.
34348,PS1,3,1036.08,1036.6,0.52,1.0,"Oh, wow."
34348,PS1,3,1037.04,1037.44,0.4,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS1,3,1037.44,1040.56,3.12,2.0,Like you cannot buy the next thing if you don't return the previous thing.
34348,PS1,3,1040.92,1053.52,12.6,1.0,"Because, and maybe it's like if you can, if, if mail men were able to like, if you like, I'll stuff it in my mailbox and then when they drop off my mail next time they pick it up and."
34348,PS1,3,1054.44,1063.8,9.36,3.0,It's kind of like you attach a service to the end of the product's life cycle with the milk can and milk bottle and with the.
34348,PS1,3,1063.88,1064.08,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS1,3,1064.4,1067.68,3.28,3.0,"The the disposal camera, it's like this, yeah."
34348,PS1,3,1067.68,1076.8,9.12,3.0,"But for example, what, how, what can we do to attach like a service to like every single type of plastic waste?"
34348,PS1,3,1079.12,1087.12,8.0,2.0,"Like you would not get, you will not be able to buy anything unless you give like like now they have those stores right where they store everything in glass containers."
34348,PS1,3,1087.12,1087.44,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
34348,PS1,3,1087.44,1099.48,12.04,2.0,"So you have to bring your own whatever jar and then they will whatever amount you want of any liquids or anything or shampoo or anything, they will store it in your container."
34348,PS1,3,1099.72,1101.92,2.2,2.0,But they're not like selling plastic out.
34348,PS1,3,1102.6,1106.64,4.04,2.0,So like they have like a whole containers of products that they store.
34348,PS1,3,1107.24,1108.64,1.4,2.0,But like you have to bring your own stuff.
34348,PS1,3,1108.64,1112.8,4.16,2.0,Like you cannot like have like a plastic bottle with like multiple things.
34348,PS1,3,1113.88,1118.72,4.84,2.0,"So it becomes it becomes it's a tedious process, but you have to bring your own containers."
34348,PS1,3,1118.72,1120.76,2.04,2.0,You have to bring your own glass jars and everything.
34348,PS1,3,1120.76,1121.44,0.68,3.0,It is.
34348,PS1,3,1123.64,1128.04,4.4,1.0,I think how can we make that even easier?
34348,PS1,3,1128.04,1133.64,5.6,1.0,"Because like think about it like, I don't know if you guys have this, but we have A to recycle cans, you can get $0.05."
34348,PS1,3,1133.64,1140.44,6.8,1.0,"So you go to the supermarket usually and you go and like people will just collect them by the bags and then go and go all, I'll go all in."
34348,PS1,3,1140.72,1145.88,5.16,1.0,"So I think attaching money to it is, is, is an idea where you're like, OK, now go to the supermarket."
34348,PS1,3,1145.88,1148.12,2.24,1.0,"If you recycle this, like you'll also get $0.05."
34348,PS1,3,1148.52,1150.4,1.88,1.0,So I feel like that's been pretty good.
34348,PS1,3,1153.04,1157.92,4.88,3.0,"I feel like cans, I I think that aluminium is like the most recycled material as well."
34348,PS1,3,1158.6,1161.6,3.0,3.0,"What's hard, it's the plastic, especially if it's food packaging."
34348,PS1,3,1161.6,1164.76,3.16,3.0,It has all the like dirty stuff like dripping around it.
34348,PS1,3,1164.96,1166.0,1.04,3.0,That's when it gets hard.
34348,PS1,3,1166.6,1185.48,18.88,1.0,So I think we'd say we we'll start off by saying minimize plastic distribution and then any plastic that does get distributed offer either an incentive whether that's a positive or negative.
34348,PS1,3,1185.84,1192.36,6.52,2.0,"Like maybe during the production phase, every piece of plastic that you use is taxed upon in every industry."
34348,PS1,3,1192.64,1198.2,5.56,2.0,"When it comes to consumer phase, every plastic that you get turned back is something that you get money on."
34348,PS1,3,1199.04,1200.44,1.4,3.0,So that would be considered.
34348,PS1,3,1200.44,1202.96,2.52,2.0,The production at and at the consumer stage.
34348,PS1,3,1203.04,1208.72,5.68,3.0,"So basically like we incentivize the the, the the the companies."
34348,PS1,3,1209.24,1214.6,5.36,2.0,"Because the company, it's the only way they will get incentivize if they have to pay on something so they don't want to pay anyways."
34348,PS1,3,1214.6,1216.24,1.64,2.0,Consumer will be if you're getting money.
34348,PS1,3,1216.6,1222.52,5.92,1.0,"My fear is that if they get taxed on it, it won't stop them so much as it will just increase the price of the product."
34348,PS1,3,1222.64,1223.72,1.08,2.0,Or maybe we have a cap.
34348,PS1,3,1223.92,1225.32,1.4,2.0,This is your size of the company.
34348,PS1,3,1225.32,1226.48,1.16,2.0,You can only use this much.
34348,PS1,3,1227.04,1238.16,11.12,1.0,"Because if you think about it, then it's like they because I think they will have to use depending on like let's say it's clothes, like they'll have they'll I mean, maybe I'm just being limited by my own imagination."
34348,PS1,3,1238.16,1238.2,0.04,1.0,I.
34348,PS1,3,1239.0,1239.32,0.32,2.0,Don't know.

36473,PS5,3,214.68,215.76,1.08,3.0,"Works hard, works."
36473,PS5,3,216.88,217.16,0.28,2.0,Oh.

36473,PS5,3,226.04,232.8,6.76,1.0,When your attention so do you her clarity change the wording I should change in addition to as.
36473,PS5,3,235.12,235.48,0.36,2.0,"Well, as."
36473,PS5,3,239.2,240.4,1.2,1.0,This I should not use AIU.
36473,PS5,3,240.4,247.56,7.16,1.0,Why is AI not coming to talk to me as well as?
36473,PS5,3,250.28,250.36,0.08,2.0,As.
36473,PS5,3,250.68,252.2,1.52,1.0,"OK, that space, that's why."
36473,PS5,3,252.2,253.32,1.12,1.0,"No, not even the space."
36473,PS5,3,253.64,260.2,6.56,1.0,"As well as giving incentives, underlining, taking them, you know that something's wrong."
36143,PS4,3,1.32,2.36,1.04,1.0,Educational.
36143,PS4,3,7.08,8.64,1.56,2.0,Overcoming cooling education.
36143,PS4,3,15.36,18.12,2.76,1.0,"I get it, feels like the same strategy almost."
36143,PS4,3,18.28,18.6,0.32,1.0,What?
36143,PS4,3,18.6,26.36,7.76,1.0,What are the specific causes of different groups and it will be like different to different people?
36143,PS4,3,27.04,29.28,2.24,2.0,What's the rules of the equality?
36143,PS4,3,29.52,30.56,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, you could think about that."
36143,PS4,3,30.56,31.32,0.76,2.0,What's the rules?
36143,PS4,3,32.32,35.32,3.0,1.0,"The the rules, yeah, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,35.52,36.36,0.84,2.0,Also the economy.
36143,PS4,3,36.76,38.32,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,40.36,47.56,7.2,2.0,"Like the Singapore, they're Asian, they say Asian are like traded disrespectful and and or in unequal in the education system."
36143,PS4,3,48.08,55.16,7.08,2.0,"But the sorry, the country like Singapore, they got really very excellent experiences in the audition."
36143,PS4,3,55.16,59.52,4.36,1.0,So it doesn't matter what's the the race is is I think it's matter what's the economy.
36143,PS4,3,60.0,61.76,1.76,1.0,"Right, I see."
36143,PS4,3,63.76,74.16,10.4,1.0,"Yeah, I guess I, but I guess like if you're, if you're part of like this sort of working class or like that, that can also be considered like a marginalized group, I guess."
36143,PS4,3,74.4,87.76,13.36,1.0,"So it might not be like a, it might not be a race or gender in some cases, it might just, it might be more, yeah, a matter of economy."
36143,PS4,3,88.68,91.16,2.48,2.0,How do you guys define the the marginalized group?
36143,PS4,3,91.52,92.64,1.12,1.0,I guess I don't know.
36143,PS4,3,92.72,108.72,16.0,1.0,"I, I, I guess any group that doesn't have access to the same power or resources compared to another and that can be a long race or income or health lines it deserved, it could be, could be lots of different things."
36143,PS4,3,109.2,114.32,5.12,1.0,"Again, it's it's the same as the previous question, like we don't know the specific causes distribute."
36143,PS4,3,114.44,132.28,17.84,3.0,"More resources to the marginalized group and say if if we are going to offering them several like offers for missions for colleges, maybe we can say, OK, we need to have this portion of this."
36143,PS4,3,134.16,135.28,1.12,1.0,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,135.28,138.8,3.52,1.0,"So like is that what would, what do they call that?"
36143,PS4,3,140.72,145.28,4.56,1.0,"I guess, I guess that's the sort of diversity infusion like schemes for."
36143,PS4,3,148.36,149.08,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, I guess."
36143,PS4,3,149.08,150.2,1.12,1.0,I guess it's like.
36143,PS4,3,151.0,152.56,1.56,2.0,"Just just, I'm not sure."
36143,PS4,3,152.56,153.96,1.4,2.0,Do you need education reform?
36143,PS4,3,154.4,171.52,17.12,1.0,"Yeah, just like this reminds me of like, like the schools and scholarships that they have a Cambridge specifically for black people to come here to study because like they historically very underrepresented here."
36143,PS4,3,171.52,180.6,9.08,1.0,"So, but like, it might be, yeah, when we're talking about education, we're talking about like university or schools or this is too, this is too broad."
36143,PS4,3,183.12,184.36,1.24,2.0,If we only see one.
36143,PS4,3,184.56,189.16,4.6,1.0,I know maybe we just pick one specific way to solve it.
36143,PS4,3,189.16,194.08,4.92,1.0,"I don't know if it's going to be judged on like the creativity, I guess."
36143,PS4,3,194.08,194.72,0.64,1.0,So we need a.
36143,PS4,3,195.88,197.72,1.84,3.0,"Yeah, which one is the most creative?"
36143,PS4,3,198.6,201.52,2.92,1.0,"Cause yeah, I can think of something new I guess I."
36143,PS4,3,201.56,206.12,4.56,2.0,Got one proposal 'cause we can often online class resource.
36143,PS4,3,206.32,209.84,3.52,2.0,It's a free and it's available if you've got an Internet computer.
36143,PS4,3,210.24,211.12,0.88,1.0,"That's a good idea, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,212.56,213.72,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, it's AI that watch."
36143,PS4,3,215.44,215.92,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,215.92,219.24,3.32,1.0,"I mean, yeah, AI might be able to help with."
36143,PS4,3,219.84,223.0,3.16,3.0,IT economics can also be an influencing factor.
36143,PS4,3,223.04,227.12,4.08,3.0,"Like the really undeveloped areas, they might not have the access."
36143,PS4,3,227.76,227.88,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36143,PS4,3,229.08,229.64,0.56,3.0,Electric device.
36143,PS4,3,230.32,240.76,10.44,1.0,I do so that just remind me that there is a a scheme in the UK which is basically online tutoring for maths for disadvantaged students.
36143,PS4,3,241.56,242.96,1.4,1.0,And that's been really successful.
36143,PS4,3,242.96,244.8,1.84,1.0,So like maybe selling some.
36143,PS4,3,244.92,254.16,9.24,1.0,"Yeah, I like the idea of offering like some free classes or because it's."
36143,PS4,3,255.68,263.28,7.6,1.0,"Yeah, maybe by making it free it it sort of makes it open to everyone, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,263.44,269.88,6.44,2.0,About offering the the there's some like the iPad to the to the Public Library or something.
36143,PS4,3,270.16,271.16,1.0,1.0,"Yeah, maybe."
36143,PS4,3,271.24,282.16,10.92,1.0,"I guess it's always tricky because like, if you make it free to everyone, the people who have the most resources going to take the most advantage of it anyway because, you know, they have the time to do that."
36143,PS4,3,284.2,286.92,2.72,1.0,"But yeah, I don't know."
36143,PS4,3,287.12,304.72,17.6,1.0,"This is hard, but, but yeah, the, the, the specific one, it, it was because it was online, it meant that anyone could access it from anywhere, which which is really good, even even like on your phone."
36143,PS4,3,304.72,310.88,6.16,1.0,"Like I, I, I know that in, depending where you are in the world, that might still not be valid."
36143,PS4,3,310.88,316.08,5.2,1.0,"But if we're thinking like the UK specifically, I think that still could be a good, good option."
36143,PS4,3,316.08,318.6,2.52,1.0,"So yeah, I don't know."
36143,PS4,3,319.84,327.96,8.12,3.0,So maybe we can offer them some electric electronic devices solely for education.
36143,PS4,3,328.28,344.16,15.88,1.0,"I feel like they have those like in the UK there's at least like I feel like everyone either has a smartphone or is like there's a lot of you know, Chromebooks and things like that that are kind of just given to the whole class."
36143,PS4,3,344.16,351.92,7.76,1.0,"So like, I don't know if that like my brother had that at like a state school."
36143,PS4,3,351.92,364.08,12.16,1.0,"So at least in Scotland, I don't know if it's university, but at least for like the online tutoring, if if we just offer that, that's it doesn't matter where they access it from."
36143,PS4,3,364.08,370.24,6.16,1.0,It could be the school computer or like their phone or sort of the thing I guess.
36143,PS4,3,371.92,374.12,2.2,3.0,So we can focus on the online courses.
36143,PS4,3,374.56,375.36,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, with the."
36143,PS4,3,375.52,376.64,1.12,3.0,Systems of the AI.
36143,PS4,3,377.24,377.72,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, what?"
36143,PS4,3,377.8,379.0,1.2,1.0,What would the AI do?
36143,PS4,3,379.2,379.84,0.64,1.0,Like what?
36143,PS4,3,379.84,380.84,1.0,1.0,How would that if we.
36143,PS4,3,380.84,383.64,2.8,3.0,Only have online courses like videos.
36143,PS4,3,383.64,391.72,8.08,3.0,"The students might not be motivated to learn all of this and some knowledge are important to them, some might not be."
36143,PS4,3,392.08,400.48,8.4,3.0,So with the system AI maybe it can analyse the students needs and then show comes what they need to work more on.
36143,PS4,3,402.4,421.44,19.04,1.0,"Offer free online passes or tutoring to all students accessible from a device, computer, lap, phone, etcetera."
36143,PS4,3,424.2,427.44,3.24,1.0,Oh this would obviously be a massive like this would have to be AI.
36143,PS4,3,428.12,430.44,2.32,1.0,"Don't know if a school itself could do that, but they could."
36143,PS4,3,430.6,441.0,10.4,1.0,"They could certainly purchase a subscription to like a free thing to like again, like is are we talking about like, is this the government deciding this or is it one school?"
36143,PS4,3,441.4,444.0,2.6,1.0,I mean like the questions are not the the the.
36143,PS4,3,444.48,453.08,8.6,1.0,"We don't have the specific like context I guess to really answer the question properly, but."
36143,PS4,3,453.64,454.92,1.28,2.0,"It's OK, We're just going to mention it."
36143,PS4,3,455.04,455.2,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
36143,PS4,3,455.6,455.8,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36143,PS4,3,455.88,458.32,2.44,2.0,Because it don't need the laptop to the Public Library.
36143,PS4,3,459.12,459.72,0.6,2.0,It's don't need some.
36143,PS4,3,460.8,461.6,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, I guess."
36143,PS4,3,461.6,475.92,14.32,1.0,"But like, you know, if a kid has to like, you know, look for them, look after them after school, they're not going to go to the library to like, you know, at least with this, like, they can use it from any sort of."
36143,PS4,3,478.28,479.24,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,479.52,480.96,1.44,2.0,Because it was this marginalized group.
36143,PS4,3,481.76,488.76,7.0,2.0,"I'm more about like if so much noise group, they don't got a laptop or any phones, probably they probably all all the people have phone nowadays."
36143,PS4,3,489.2,493.6,4.4,2.0,"But unworriedly, if they do have not have any like yeah, device where, where they're going."
36143,PS4,3,493.72,497.48,3.76,1.0,"For yeah, I guess schools already have those like laptops and stuff."
36143,PS4,3,497.52,506.04,8.52,1.0,"So like, I don't know, I just think we've bought it for, you know, ratio of how much money do we have to solve this problem as well."
36143,PS4,3,506.52,507.2,0.68,1.0,"It's like, do we?"
36143,PS4,3,507.84,513.04,5.2,1.0,"Because if we do have loads of money, yeah, we could add the laptops and stuff to the school, but."
36143,PS4,3,513.16,516.52,3.36,2.0,"Sure, add advertisement like we need a lot of people."
36143,PS4,3,516.52,518.68,2.16,2.0,Now we get all this kind of resource I'd like to put it down on.
36143,PS4,3,518.84,545.16,26.32,1.0,That yeah that's and and Oh yeah add AI surface maybe advertise it specific to these marginalise because they might not think you know they might not put themselves and I had to be of like academic if they don't see themselves like in the advertising a.
36143,PS4,3,546.6,549.08,2.48,2.0,Little bit similar to to the Khan Academy.
36143,PS4,3,549.6,551.6,2.0,1.0,"Yes, Khan Academy's great."
36143,PS4,3,553.04,561.2,8.16,1.0,These classes could be supported by AIAI marking or something like that.
36143,PS4,3,562.96,586.2,23.24,1.0,"Or suggestion plans to tailor the learning to the individual and then because of that, because it's like targeted towards spam, that might help with the balancing of the sort of marginalisation to the end."
36143,PS4,3,591.2,594.92,3.72,1.0,"I think it's just like, again, we we only could do one thing."
36143,PS4,3,594.92,596.24,1.32,1.0,So I think this is a good.
36143,PS4,3,597.56,598.36,0.8,1.0,Do you have any quite a?
36143,PS4,3,599.32,599.84,0.52,3.0,Completed one.
36143,PS4,3,600.44,604.6,4.16,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36143,PS4,3,604.6,607.36,2.76,1.0,"Think, think we're good to go to the next one."
36143,PS4,3,607.36,608.28,0.92,1.0,Are you happy with that I?
36143,PS4,3,608.56,609.24,0.68,2.0,Think that's perfect?
36143,PS4,3,609.4,609.6,0.2,2.0,I think.
36143,PS4,3,609.6,610.76,1.16,2.0,I think they'll learn more.
36143,PS4,3,610.88,611.12,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35764,PS4,6,32.43,35.91,3.48,1.0,"Yeah, we think of usual answers of non creative ones."
35764,PS4,6,36.19,38.07,1.88,2.0,And what are what are the the usual answers?
35764,PS4,6,38.71,45.27,6.56,1.0,"Like what people have been doing like online courses to be tablets, everyone videos but that's not creative."
35764,PS4,6,51.75,53.23,1.48,2.0,"I mean, I mean, that's one thing."
35764,PS4,6,53.23,56.92,3.69,2.0,"Access to, Easier access to."
35764,PS4,6,71.74,80.82,9.08,1.0,"The bigger scope of within a nation, for example just within the UK, then I can think of many methods, but if it's about internationally then it's actually a very big issue."
35764,PS4,6,81.66,84.5,2.84,2.0,"Yeah, like some people can't even don't even have like, internets."
35764,PS4,6,84.62,100.16,15.54,1.0,"If it's only in the UK, then for the British citizens, I think they can the creative idea like I think of just to make a ballot system for for those who can't get good a level into universities even though, even though they they don't."
35764,PS4,6,102.44,103.24,0.8,3.0,Have the grades for.
35764,PS4,6,103.68,103.76,0.08,1.0,You.
35764,PS4,6,103.76,106.32,2.56,1.0,"Yeah, well, even though they wouldn't normally be accepted."
35764,PS4,6,106.84,108.36,1.52,2.0,"They're already doing that, I think."
35764,PS4,6,109.0,109.48,0.48,3.0,They're already.
35764,PS4,6,109.48,109.88,0.4,1.0,Doing that.
35764,PS4,6,110.52,116.28,5.76,3.0,"Well, the creative have you seen that documentary where the state school kids get swallowed with the private school kids?"
35764,PS4,6,116.28,129.36,13.08,3.0,"So if we, you know, make that a law and 100% one where if you you're from richer communities, you have to attend the state school and you're from, you know, marginalized communities, you have to attend a private school."
35764,PS4,6,130.24,130.6,0.36,4.0,If that's.
35764,PS4,6,130.92,131.76,0.84,3.0,The quality.
35764,PS4,6,132.4,133.48,1.08,4.0,What about the tuition?
35764,PS4,6,134.44,135.96,1.52,2.0,"And also like transportation, I was."
35764,PS4,6,136.28,137.84,1.56,5.0,Going to say how about attendance?
35764,PS4,6,138.04,139.04,1.0,1.0,Forced rotation.
35764,PS4,6,139.04,143.44,4.4,1.0,"So this year they are in private, next year they must be in state, and then next year they must be."
35764,PS4,6,144.0,144.32,0.32,2.0,Oh my God.
35764,PS4,6,144.52,144.8,0.28,2.0,Rotation.
35764,PS4,6,145.04,145.72,0.68,1.0,Every single year.
35764,PS4,6,146.48,147.76,1.28,1.0,It's creative and practical.
35764,PS4,6,150.24,156.0,5.76,4.0,What about the robot teachers with building like Professor ChatGPT I think.
35764,PS4,6,156.36,157.8,1.44,2.0,Professor chat so definitely ask for.
35764,PS4,6,157.84,158.56,0.72,4.0,That better than?
35764,PS4,6,159.16,159.68,0.52,3.0,A lot of.
35764,PS4,6,160.2,160.68,0.48,4.0,Teachers.
35764,PS4,6,160.96,161.8,0.84,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35764,PS4,6,163.6,165.56,1.96,1.0,Also rotational teachers I think.
35764,PS4,6,165.8,167.48,1.68,1.0,"I mean, you could have already been done in some."
35764,PS4,6,168.36,175.76,7.4,6.0,Cases like if it's school you could have budget swap that's like for one month when you get the product the whatever.
35764,PS4,6,176.8,177.16,0.36,4.0,The school.
35764,PS4,6,177.16,177.92,0.76,6.0,With a bigger budget.
35764,PS4,6,178.4,182.68,4.28,2.0,I feel like a bureaucratic nightmare involving like.
35764,PS4,6,183.08,183.24,0.16,1.0,A lot.
35764,PS4,6,188.12,197.32,9.2,5.0,A lot of the problem of getting disadvantaged and marginalized groups that people access to education is actually getting them there.
35764,PS4,6,199.56,210.6,11.04,5.0,And there is a lot more school refusal of pupils that attend state schools then attend private schools.
35764,PS4,6,211.2,223.68,12.48,5.0,"So maybe there is some sort of incentive or even a transport system that takes children from some of the poorest areas, actually delivers them to school."
35764,PS4,6,224.76,236.92,12.16,5.0,"I mean, it would be, it would cost an absolute fortune, but we're asked to come up with a creative idea and part of getting the part of getting the children their education is getting them into the schools."
35764,PS4,6,244.96,252.84,7.88,4.0,"And actually what happens in China to solve this is that children now when they enter primary school, they don't take exams."
35764,PS4,6,253.68,260.68,7.0,4.0,"Instead, they take lotteries, and only the ones who get the win, the lotteries will enter those private schools."
35764,PS4,6,260.68,262.76,2.08,2.0,So it's like a like a random system.
35764,PS4,6,262.76,262.96,0.2,3.0,Who pays?
35764,PS4,6,262.96,263.32,0.36,3.0,Who pays?
35764,PS4,6,264.44,274.52,10.08,4.0,"The actually, most families can pay for a tuition, but there are a lot of children who cannot get score because of their lack of educational resources."
35764,PS4,6,275.04,282.72,7.68,4.0,"But the tuition is not a huge burden, but instead all those preparations for preparing for the exam is a huge."
35764,PS4,6,282.72,284.36,1.64,1.0,Burden for the families.
35764,PS4,6,284.68,285.52,0.84,3.0,"OK, Yeah."
35764,PS4,6,286.24,287.76,1.52,4.0,That's that's why here comes.
35764,PS4,6,287.84,290.2,2.36,3.0,"Well, so you're punishing like smarter kids."
35764,PS4,6,290.32,291.04,0.72,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35764,PS4,6,291.08,291.88,0.8,4.0,"Actually, it is."
35764,PS4,6,291.92,292.88,0.96,3.0,Working hard.
35764,PS4,6,293.4,300.68,7.28,1.0,"And also they another thing they did is that they nationalized all the private schools for, for the primary and secondary ones."
35764,PS4,6,302.2,313.48,11.28,1.0,"So none of the, I mean, it's not, it's not really nationalizing, but all the private schools don't have their own rights to, to, to, to decide which students they will have."
35764,PS4,6,314.28,321.2,6.92,1.0,"So all the private schools will be, will, will enter the same system of, you know, admissions as the state schools."
35764,PS4,6,321.44,327.44,6.0,1.0,So the government will decide what kind of students are going to which kind of given private or state schools.
35764,PS4,6,328.2,341.28,13.08,4.0,And for my high school now it has like 50% of the students that it can control and 50% are from the government programme that they they will decide who which kids will enter a school.
35764,PS4,6,341.28,341.52,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
35764,PS4,6,342.08,345.2,3.12,6.0,What's what's the difference between a state school and a private school like?
35764,PS4,6,345.84,347.2,1.36,4.0,Usually private schools have.
35764,PS4,6,347.64,347.92,0.28,4.0,Oh yeah.
35764,PS4,6,348.08,350.56,2.48,1.0,"So usually that you know, you say the state school is actually a but."
35764,PS4,6,350.8,360.64,9.84,6.0,"Is it like if, if the students just get allocated and like, you know, I guess the funding, would there be any difference in funding if it's just random students go away?"
35764,PS4,6,361.52,362.44,0.92,1.0,I mean in China or in the.
35764,PS4,6,362.44,362.84,0.4,6.0,In China.
35764,PS4,6,364.68,366.08,1.4,1.0,"Well, they, they certainly will."
35764,PS4,6,366.64,372.0,5.36,1.0,"The tuition fee will be slightly different, but it's compared to it's, it's not really that high so."
35764,PS4,6,372.08,380.24,8.16,6.0,What like what would be the difference between going to for a student going to a state school in front one if they're just if all the students abandoned?
35764,PS4,6,380.36,389.96,9.6,4.0,"At least in my hometown, the private schools have better teachers so that's the main reason why many families want their kids to go to."
35764,PS4,6,390.16,390.6,0.44,1.0,Private.
35764,PS4,6,390.6,397.76,7.16,4.0,School Another reason in the past why why they want the kids to go to primary school is that they think primary school has better kids.
35764,PS4,6,398.32,402.2,3.88,4.0,"But with the random, do I agree that that long change goes away?"
35764,PS4,6,404.2,406.4,2.2,6.0,"I'm interested, I'll ask later if you run out of time."
35764,PS4,6,408.48,408.72,0.24,6.0,Is that?
35764,PS4,6,409.52,411.92,2.4,1.0,And and the teachable attention thing is already happening.
35764,PS4,6,412.32,419.36,7.04,1.0,"So once the teacher have been in private school for long enough, then they they are asked to go to another state school or another one school."
35764,PS4,6,419.6,420.96,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, in my in my home city, actually."
35764,PS4,6,421.2,426.72,5.52,3.0,"That's a good, that's actually a good way to facilitate because as long as you can pay more."
35764,PS4,6,427.48,427.72,0.24,1.0,Teachers.
35764,PS4,6,431.68,437.52,5.84,1.0,But then it's the teacher is unhappy about it because they have to travel much for a much longer distance.
35764,PS4,6,438.24,442.12,3.88,1.0,"Or in many cases, the teachers usually go to the same school as their children, right?"
35764,PS4,6,442.36,446.44,4.08,1.0,But when the teachers are rotated away then they they create burden for the teachers.
35764,PS4,6,446.52,449.4,2.88,3.0,"Because private schools are not distributed geographically, right?"
35764,PS4,6,449.52,452.64,3.12,3.0,"They're just, you know, they're not region based or."
35764,PS4,6,454.28,454.52,0.24,6.0,Anything.
35764,PS4,6,454.6,455.24,0.64,6.0,What what?
35764,PS4,6,455.4,459.6,4.2,6.0,Why did the like private schools get the better teachers?
35764,PS4,6,459.76,460.92,1.16,1.0,Because they can't pay.
35764,PS4,6,460.96,461.96,1.0,4.0,Higher to.
35764,PS4,6,462.28,463.2,0.92,1.0,Recruit better teachers.
35764,PS4,6,463.4,463.76,0.36,5.0,Pay more.
35764,PS4,6,464.28,468.72,4.44,6.0,But then where does the actual money come from for the private ones like?
35764,PS4,6,469.72,469.84,0.12,4.0,It's.
35764,PS4,6,472.84,474.56,1.72,1.0,"Just a positive circulation, right?"
35764,PS4,6,474.56,476.76,2.2,1.0,So they that's how primary schools work.
35764,PS4,6,479.16,479.56,0.4,6.0,"Yeah, the."
35764,PS4,6,479.68,485.48,5.8,3.0,"Lottery things, They're not exactly accepting students with lesser money, but they're accepting students with lesser grades."
35764,PS4,6,485.76,486.44,0.68,6.0,"That's what they're, yeah."
35764,PS4,6,487.88,488.56,0.68,4.0,So it's that.
35764,PS4,6,488.6,489.16,0.56,1.0,Kind of.
35764,PS4,6,489.2,489.56,0.36,3.0,Education.
35764,PS4,6,489.56,490.04,0.48,3.0,That's right.
35764,PS4,6,490.04,491.32,1.28,3.0,So technically doesn't.
35764,PS4,6,493.48,493.8,0.32,3.0,It's not.
35764,PS4,6,493.8,495.12,1.32,6.0,This point that makes more sense.
35764,PS4,6,498.44,499.12,0.68,3.0,But that's worse.
35764,PS4,6,499.6,500.04,0.44,3.0,You can't.
35764,PS4,6,500.2,505.04,4.84,5.0,Staff rotations so that educators are required to swap between.
35764,PS4,6,506.04,507.08,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, they could."
35764,PS4,6,507.08,507.72,0.64,1.0,That's that's the point.
35764,PS4,6,507.72,512.36,4.64,1.0,So just make the good schools as bad as as bad schools and then they are equal.
35764,PS4,6,513.28,514.88,1.6,1.0,"Yeah, that's the."
35764,PS4,6,515.04,515.48,0.44,2.0,Same.
35764,PS4,6,515.48,516.04,0.56,1.0,As projects.
35764,PS4,6,518.76,520.68,1.92,5.0,So that the the teachers themselves don't.
35764,PS4,6,521.52,521.72,0.2,3.0,Have to.
35764,PS4,6,521.84,522.96,1.12,5.0,Stop themselves that point of private.
35764,PS4,6,525.88,536.12,10.24,4.0,"School teachers go to school, Yeah, Still brings a little bit benefit for teachers because I know for most private students, teachers have very, very low pensions."
35764,PS4,6,536.8,539.0,2.2,4.0,But in state schools they have much higher pensions.
35764,PS4,6,539.12,549.16,10.04,4.0,"So maybe after they teach 20 years, taking the salary from primary school and then they go to state school, teach for 10 years and then retire winning a high pension."
35764,PS4,6,549.28,549.6,0.32,1.0,Also.
35764,PS4,6,550.04,550.64,0.6,4.0,I think feels good.
35764,PS4,6,550.64,551.0,0.36,4.0,"Yeah, between."
35764,PS4,6,552.16,552.64,0.48,6.0,The public and.
35764,PS4,6,552.68,553.2,0.52,5.0,Private OH.
35764,PS4,6,555.0,555.12,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35764,PS4,6,564.44,568.6,4.16,1.0,"The medical is the same price, so not everyone gets equal chance of getting the bad doctors."
35764,PS4,6,571.16,572.6,1.44,1.0,Everyone gets the same bad doctor.
35764,PS4,6,573.4,573.8,0.4,2.0,Did I miss?
35764,PS4,6,573.84,574.28,0.44,1.0,Anything.
35764,PS4,6,574.44,576.92,2.48,1.0,"It's about inequality, not about the average quality."
35764,PS4,6,576.92,578.52,1.6,1.0,It's just inequality.
35764,PS4,6,580.24,581.24,1.0,1.0,All the doctors are bad.
35764,PS4,6,600.32,608.96,8.64,1.0,"And internationally speaking, there are even lots of places where they the kids are supporting wars or poverty or, you know, starvation."
35764,PS4,6,609.04,613.0,3.96,1.0,"So that's even, that's even a more difficult issue to solve."
35764,PS4,6,614.08,615.24,1.16,1.0,It's actually a very big question.
35764,PS4,6,615.56,616.96,1.4,1.0,I don't think we can finish in one minute.
35764,PS4,6,620.48,620.52,0.04,3.0,I.
35764,PS4,6,621.44,621.84,0.4,5.0,Think so.
35764,PS4,6,622.76,629.52,6.76,6.0,So that so the lottery system we've written down so it says everyone gets a chance to get into a better funded school.
35764,PS4,6,631.56,638.44,6.88,6.0,"So, but is this lottery again just for people who would be able to pay that anyway, you know, for the."
35764,PS4,6,639.0,643.76,4.76,3.0,"No, I think it's for the disadvantaged and marginalized group in this case."
35764,PS4,6,649.8,652.6,2.8,1.0,I think that it's similar to the housing scheme in the UK.
35764,PS4,6,652.6,655.88,3.28,1.0,"So for example the Addington Park, there are lots of shared housing."
35764,PS4,6,656.8,674.64,17.84,1.0,"So there is a governmental, you know, threshold of shared ownership stuff so that those with marginalised disadvantage group can have the same resource of the advantage ones, just for example 20% of them."
35764,PS4,6,675.88,677.32,1.44,2.0,"OK, last 44 seconds."
35764,PS4,6,678.64,678.96,0.32,3.0,OK.
35932,PS2,6,10.83,26.62,15.79,1.0,"Oh well, I don't know if anyone has an idea or wants to."
35932,PS2,6,26.62,27.22,0.6,2.0,Start.
35932,PS2,6,32.22,39.84,7.62,3.0,Maybe like introduce AI tracking system to because it it mentions inefficient schedules.
35932,PS2,6,39.84,47.84,8.0,3.0,So I guess it's it's the the humans that are not able to arrange schedules efficiently.
35932,PS2,6,48.08,56.36,8.28,3.0,"So, so maybe, maybe a computer system introduce embedded AI system into the company system?"
35932,PS2,6,57.32,57.52,0.2,3.0,I don't.
35932,PS2,6,57.52,60.16,2.64,1.0,Know no definitely put more.
35932,PS2,6,60.16,61.32,1.16,2.0,Trackers throughout.
35932,PS2,6,61.32,64.28,2.96,1.0,The supply chain so you can kind of control.
35932,PS2,6,64.44,67.28,2.84,2.0,Really pinpoint where there is problem within.
35932,PS2,6,67.28,69.16,1.88,1.0,The the the supply.
35932,PS2,6,69.16,72.12,2.96,2.0,Chain more effectively and I do agree on the fact.
35932,PS2,6,72.12,78.0,5.88,1.0,That it's but amazing kind of like that control would be nice through AI would be.
35932,PS2,6,78.2,79.52,1.32,2.0,At least more effective than.
35932,PS2,6,80.08,83.24,3.16,1.0,The humans 'cause I guess uncontrolled costs can also.
35932,PS2,6,83.24,85.12,1.88,2.0,Come from the human.
35932,PS2,6,85.12,87.16,2.04,1.0,Interactions like within the supply.
35932,PS2,6,87.16,88.48,1.32,2.0,Chain if there are like small.
35932,PS2,6,88.48,89.56,1.08,1.0,Changes the human.
35932,PS2,6,89.56,91.12,1.56,3.0,"My mistakes, yes."
35932,PS2,6,91.12,91.44,0.32,3.0,Make.
35932,PS2,6,91.44,91.8,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,93.56,94.16,0.6,4.0,Like won't be.
35932,PS2,6,94.16,94.6,0.44,1.0,Possible.
35932,PS2,6,94.6,100.24,5.64,4.0,"With the AI, humans can be can do the more mistakes than the AI thing."
35932,PS2,6,100.24,102.16,1.92,4.0,So because it's computer generated.
35932,PS2,6,102.64,104.52,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, and I think they could be."
35932,PS2,6,104.76,106.6,1.84,2.0,Super effective to rather than.
35932,PS2,6,106.92,111.0,4.08,1.0,Ask the human to see the problems and then introduce them into a system.
35932,PS2,6,111.0,111.24,0.24,1.0,It's.
35932,PS2,6,111.24,117.76,6.52,2.0,Better to have an AI that it's kind of sends like messages whenever there is a problem and then.
35932,PS2,6,117.76,119.4,1.64,1.0,We have a human go through them.
35932,PS2,6,119.6,123.52,3.92,2.0,And then sort out where like it's actually there is something.
35932,PS2,6,123.76,124.96,1.2,1.0,That should be fixed.
35932,PS2,6,125.72,125.84,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,128.44,128.56,0.12,5.0,Right.
35932,PS2,6,128.56,136.08,7.52,5.0,And maybe we can increase the diversity of the supply chain so that we can easily like replace the suppliers.
35932,PS2,6,136.36,137.6,1.24,3.0,To reduce.
35932,PS2,6,137.6,139.36,1.76,5.0,The vulnerabilities.
35932,PS2,6,140.76,142.12,1.36,1.0,"Yeah, actually I."
35932,PS2,6,143.0,143.68,0.68,6.0,I do have a.
35932,PS2,6,144.08,145.2,1.12,1.0,Like question about.
35932,PS2,6,145.2,145.64,0.44,6.0,What?
35932,PS2,6,145.64,146.24,0.6,6.0,What?
35932,PS2,6,146.72,148.72,2.0,1.0,Could like vulnerabilities.
35932,PS2,6,148.72,149.24,0.52,2.0,Within a.
35932,PS2,6,149.24,155.44,6.2,1.0,Supply chain mean specifically Good question.
35932,PS2,6,158.08,158.92,0.84,4.0,Because I don't know.
35932,PS2,6,158.92,159.76,0.84,1.0,Much about supply.
35932,PS2,6,159.76,160.4,0.64,3.0,Chain so.
35932,PS2,6,160.92,161.56,0.64,1.0,I don't know.
35932,PS2,6,161.56,162.84,1.28,2.0,"Much either, but I would."
35932,PS2,6,162.84,163.36,0.52,1.0,Guess.
35932,PS2,6,163.36,164.56,1.2,1.0,Assume at least that.
35932,PS2,6,164.88,166.8,1.92,2.0,The number of teas are kind of.
35932,PS2,6,166.8,167.32,0.52,1.0,Pinpoints.
35932,PS2,6,167.32,168.44,1.12,2.0,Where there is.
35932,PS2,6,168.48,169.2,0.72,1.0,A probability.
35932,PS2,6,169.2,170.88,1.68,2.0,That some error could be.
35932,PS2,6,170.96,171.28,0.32,1.0,Made.
35932,PS2,6,171.28,173.28,2.0,1.0,It's like the weakest element in the supply chain.
35932,PS2,6,174.52,175.6,1.08,2.0,"For instance, I would say if."
35932,PS2,6,175.6,175.76,0.16,1.0,It's.
35932,PS2,6,175.76,180.64,4.88,2.0,Like a delivery system like assuming going back to the schedules.
35932,PS2,6,180.96,184.52,3.56,1.0,"I would say that if it's a human who fixes the schedule, it might be like."
35932,PS2,6,184.96,189.12,4.16,2.0,"More likely that there is a mistake rather than if it's everything, it's through a computer and."
35932,PS2,6,189.12,189.84,0.72,1.0,People just.
35932,PS2,6,190.6,190.84,0.24,3.0,"Yeah, and."
35932,PS2,6,193.2,199.92,6.72,5.0,"I will do it in a more macro way because I'm studying the climate, climate risks."
35932,PS2,6,200.28,210.12,9.84,5.0,"So maybe in the global supply chain, maybe there's some geopolitical risks or some extreme weather events which will disturb the supply chain."
35932,PS2,6,210.32,212.64,2.32,5.0,"That's more macro perspective, yeah."
35932,PS2,6,213.36,213.72,0.36,2.0,That should.
35932,PS2,6,213.96,217.64,3.68,1.0,And I think that that could be linked also with the idea of uncontrolled costs the.
35932,PS2,6,217.8,218.8,1.0,2.0,The fact that if there is.
35932,PS2,6,219.28,220.2,0.92,1.0,Any slight change?
35932,PS2,6,220.2,222.76,2.56,2.0,In the world it might affect like the price of the.
35932,PS2,6,222.76,223.48,0.72,1.0,Other things that.
35932,PS2,6,223.52,227.84,4.32,2.0,"Come into your supply chains, whether it's like the material or even."
35932,PS2,6,227.84,228.76,0.92,1.0,The human if there are.
35932,PS2,6,228.76,231.04,2.28,2.0,Difference in salaries or whatever for.
35932,PS2,6,232.08,233.28,1.2,6.0,How would you tackle that though?
35932,PS2,6,233.32,233.48,0.16,6.0,What?
35932,PS2,6,234.08,234.16,0.08,3.0,Do.
35932,PS2,6,234.2,245.44,11.24,6.0,"You think because it says come up with an idea to tackle that, How would you tackle whether I don't know, is that a bit out of our control or?"
35932,PS2,6,246.04,250.8,4.76,1.0,"I would guess that with AI, the interesting thing would be kind of like to put."
35932,PS2,6,251.04,252.08,1.04,2.0,Check up points.
35932,PS2,6,252.76,260.28,7.52,1.0,In place at all the vulnerability spots in supply chain if you identify them and then kind of implement like try to put AI.
35932,PS2,6,260.28,261.36,1.08,2.0,Into it whether it's like.
35932,PS2,6,262.56,265.28,2.72,1.0,"Yeah, I don't know like kind of model the probability of cost."
35932,PS2,6,265.28,266.92,1.64,2.0,Going up or down and kind of.
35932,PS2,6,267.12,270.64,3.52,1.0,Then try and and and see like OK if.
35932,PS2,6,270.64,271.96,1.32,2.0,Costs are likely to.
35932,PS2,6,271.96,272.36,0.4,1.0,Go up.
35932,PS2,6,272.48,274.48,2.0,1.0,How can we like try to navigate?
35932,PS2,6,274.48,275.64,1.16,2.0,This so we prevent.
35932,PS2,6,275.84,276.6,0.76,1.0,Any problems?
35932,PS2,6,277.04,277.44,0.4,2.0,Kind of.
35932,PS2,6,277.56,278.04,0.48,1.0,I think.
35932,PS2,6,278.28,283.72,5.44,3.0,So like AAI monitoring system that tracks every step of the supply chain process?
35932,PS2,6,283.88,284.16,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,284.16,288.8,4.64,3.0,And gives feedback to people who are managing the AI basically.
35932,PS2,6,288.8,298.76,9.96,3.0,"So the so the people themselves don't need to track every step, but the AI, it's AI provide feedback to the humans and humans just verify what AI has done."
35932,PS2,6,300.28,303.72,3.44,2.0,I think I really resonate with the monitoring word that you use and.
35932,PS2,6,303.72,305.2,1.48,1.0,The fact that it's like AI is.
35932,PS2,6,305.28,305.48,0.2,2.0,Built.
35932,PS2,6,305.56,307.32,1.76,2.0,It's really used as a tool then to.
35932,PS2,6,307.32,308.96,1.64,1.0,Kind of have checker points throughout the.
35932,PS2,6,309.0,309.72,0.72,3.0,Supply chain.
35932,PS2,6,310.12,311.12,1.0,1.0,And model how it?
35932,PS2,6,311.12,312.36,1.24,2.0,Could go wrong somehow.
35932,PS2,6,312.36,315.92,3.56,1.0,And then have that interaction.
35932,PS2,6,315.92,316.52,0.6,2.0,With humans.
35932,PS2,6,316.52,320.8,4.28,1.0,Who can actually like then try to to know navigate what to do from?
35932,PS2,6,320.96,324.08,3.12,2.0,From there and see whether there really is a risk or a problem.
35932,PS2,6,326.76,327.64,0.88,3.0,Should we put that down?
35932,PS2,6,328.92,329.48,0.56,2.0,Or yeah.
35932,PS2,6,331.8,334.64,2.84,3.0,"So, yeah, maybe so."
35932,PS2,6,334.64,335.0,0.36,1.0,So what?
35932,PS2,6,335.0,335.24,0.24,3.0,Was the.
35932,PS2,6,335.28,335.8,0.52,3.0,What was the?
35932,PS2,6,335.88,336.56,0.68,2.0,Idea so.
35932,PS2,6,336.96,344.08,7.12,3.0,Introduce an AI system embedded into the existing company system and what was it?
35932,PS2,6,344.96,348.92,3.96,3.0,Step wait AI monitoring in each step of the supply.
35932,PS2,6,349.2,354.8,5.6,4.0,Starting from the first point and then point of the delivery starting from the first one.
35932,PS2,6,354.8,370.6,15.8,4.0,"I think just the incoming of the goods from the source, from source to the goods are delivered to the customer or the third party, whatever the school system should be the AI generators for that."
35932,PS2,6,371.2,373.52,2.32,1.0,And I would also try.
35932,PS2,6,373.52,374.76,1.24,2.0,And use first of all the.
35932,PS2,6,374.96,376.56,1.6,1.0,AI to kind of.
35932,PS2,6,376.56,378.8,2.24,2.0,Track where are the vulnerabilities.
35932,PS2,6,379.16,379.72,0.56,1.0,Vulnerabilities.
35932,PS2,6,380.76,380.96,0.2,3.0,In the.
35932,PS2,6,381.0,384.84,3.84,1.0,"Supply chain, because that's what's then causing the the problem."
35932,PS2,6,384.84,386.32,1.48,2.0,So if you can.
35932,PS2,6,386.32,387.4,1.08,1.0,Kind of pinpoint.
35932,PS2,6,387.8,388.84,1.04,2.0,To AI where?
35932,PS2,6,388.84,392.2,3.36,1.0,You have the most I would say situation within this.
35932,PS2,6,392.2,392.72,0.52,6.0,Fighting.
35932,PS2,6,393.24,393.8,0.56,1.0,Deficiency.
35932,PS2,6,394.44,394.88,0.44,2.0,And try to.
35932,PS2,6,394.88,395.72,0.84,1.0,Work on these.
35932,PS2,6,400.12,413.26,13.14,6.0,And report to the people managing the system.
35932,PS2,6,417.76,422.6,4.84,3.0,"And you mentioned the model, building the model to track costs, whether it's efficient."
35932,PS2,6,422.92,425.04,2.12,1.0,"Yeah, I would say to track that in fluctuation."
35932,PS2,6,425.04,426.36,1.32,3.0,"Fluctuations, yeah, that's."
35932,PS2,6,428.84,428.96,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,428.96,433.68,4.72,5.0,"And apart from the real time monitoring, maybe we can also make some predictions."
35932,PS2,6,434.28,435.04,0.76,3.0,"For prediction, yeah."
35932,PS2,6,435.28,439.08,3.8,5.0,"Yeah, we can like predict the demand or some."
35932,PS2,6,439.68,440.36,0.68,3.0,Fluctuations.
35932,PS2,6,440.72,445.76,5.04,5.0,"Maybe probably happen in the future, so then we can increase the stock or something."
35932,PS2,6,446.32,446.56,0.24,1.0,Like that?
35932,PS2,6,446.56,446.76,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,448.84,450.04,1.2,3.0,Make creations of demand.
35932,PS2,6,450.56,457.32,6.76,6.0,To adjust supply.
35932,PS2,6,459.84,461.4,1.56,4.0,Comparing the demand and supply.
35932,PS2,6,467.68,469.52,1.84,3.0,To adjust supply and delivery maybe?
35932,PS2,6,469.88,470.12,0.24,5.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,474.6,474.92,0.32,1.0,So.
35932,PS2,6,474.92,479.76,4.84,3.0,"Like each, each step of the supply chain has one system?"
35932,PS2,6,479.84,483.2,3.36,3.0,"Or is it like a unified system, maybe like checkpoints?"
35932,PS2,6,483.72,485.32,1.6,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35932,PS2,6,486.04,494.88,8.84,1.0,"I think that the little bit actually both of the have another system, but as you mentioned that has checkpoints and that kind of goes through all the steps."
35932,PS2,6,495.08,498.12,3.04,3.0,"Yeah, should be."
35932,PS2,6,506.96,509.12,2.16,6.0,Individually as separate.
35932,PS2,6,509.12,509.84,0.72,3.0,Checkpoints.
35932,PS2,6,510.08,511.48,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35932,PS2,6,515.24,516.56,1.32,6.0,Everything where I'm writing is really bad.
35932,PS2,6,516.56,518.08,1.52,6.0,"Told me I'll change it, no."
35932,PS2,6,519.08,520.0,0.92,2.0,It's actually pretty good.
35932,PS2,6,520.08,522.08,2.0,2.0,It's like the most stressful way.
35932,PS2,6,522.12,526.12,4.0,2.0,I think you can write this with like 500 people.
35932,PS2,6,536.4,539.84,3.44,3.0,Maybe like auto scheduling for the delivery schedule thing?
35932,PS2,6,540.2,547.56,7.36,3.0,"Yeah, the I would assume it's the final step of the supply chain like schedule delivery, like auto scheduling tool."
35932,PS2,6,549.08,553.04,3.96,1.0,"Yeah, I would say that most things in the in the change."
35932,PS2,6,553.36,553.84,0.48,2.0,Are.
35932,PS2,6,554.56,555.04,0.48,1.0,Controlled.
35932,PS2,6,555.04,556.52,1.48,2.0,By computers and more.
35932,PS2,6,556.52,561.6,5.08,1.0,Data the AI has like to analyse and then I think the the feedback.
35932,PS2,6,561.6,564.24,2.64,2.0,They can give you is even more precise.
35932,PS2,6,565.32,565.72,0.4,1.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,566.24,570.76,4.52,3.0,"So yeah, yeah, that's good."
35932,PS2,6,575.04,576.84,1.8,3.0,Should we click next or?
35932,PS2,6,576.84,577.2,0.36,1.0,Is there?
35932,PS2,6,577.2,577.48,0.28,3.0,Any.
35932,PS2,6,577.68,581.68,4.0,6.0,Are we should get with a lot or should we write OK?
35932,PS2,6,581.76,582.12,0.36,6.0,Yeah.
35932,PS2,6,583.4,584.92,1.52,2.0,"Yeah, I I would advise, Yeah, yeah."
35932,PS2,6,585.76,586.48,0.72,6.0,"Yeah, that good."
35932,PS2,6,586.8,587.76,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, I think it's good."
35932,PS2,6,588.04,588.96,0.92,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35914,PS2,6,1.28,6.0,4.72,1.0,Vulnerabilities within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
35914,PS2,6,6.0,8.96,2.96,1.0,Come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security.
35914,PS2,6,13.56,15.24,1.68,2.0,Ban international trade.
35914,PS2,6,20.36,22.56,2.2,3.0,I feel like these questions are very economics oriented.
35914,PS2,6,23.8,24.84,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, I can see the."
35914,PS2,6,24.84,25.92,1.08,4.0,Economics coming out of it.
35914,PS2,6,25.92,26.52,0.6,4.0,I see a supply.
35914,PS2,6,26.52,27.0,0.48,1.0,Chain I go.
35914,PS2,6,28.92,29.68,0.76,3.0,"For this minute, it's."
35914,PS2,6,36.12,40.72,4.6,2.0,"Security, well, if you don't have supply chains, there's no supply chain security issues."
35914,PS2,6,42.08,44.64,2.56,2.0,So span international trade.
35914,PS2,6,44.64,48.72,4.08,2.0,"Or like do what Trump is doing, raise 25% tariff on everyone."
35914,PS2,6,54.24,54.6,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,54.6,62.88,8.28,3.0,"I mean, or go the other way and ensure collaboration or agreements more sort of like, I don't know, incentives for everyone to participate in a collaborative way."
35914,PS2,6,65.28,65.52,0.24,5.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,65.52,66.4,0.88,5.0,"I mean, maybe there could."
35914,PS2,6,66.4,67.12,0.72,6.0,Be like.
35914,PS2,6,67.84,77.12,9.28,5.0,"Economic advantages to ensuring supply chain security, but then everything would be more expensive, so."
35914,PS2,6,77.52,78.0,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, like."
35914,PS2,6,78.84,84.96,6.12,5.0,"It's I guess it's a trade off thing, like the more security you want probably the more expensive it's going to be."
35914,PS2,6,84.96,89.8,4.84,2.0,Exactly because you have to give premium to the risk like that people are taking.
35914,PS2,6,90.52,101.88,11.36,2.0,"So I don't think there's a way in which you can just like have the cake and eat it too, in that sense."
35914,PS2,6,104.04,104.16,0.12,4.0,But.
35914,PS2,6,104.16,108.12,3.96,3.0,What about creating interdependencies between the parties that are part of the supply chain?
35914,PS2,6,108.32,111.96,3.64,2.0,"But the more interdependencies you create, the more vulnerable people actually are."
35914,PS2,6,113.28,117.88,4.6,3.0,"Yeah, but if they're vulnerable to each other, then presumably they have an incentive not to default, right?"
35914,PS2,6,119.52,122.04,2.52,2.0,Typically they already have a lot of incentives not to.
35914,PS2,6,122.08,126.88,4.8,2.0,I mean like the biggest like global supply chain issue like during COVID was not really.
35914,PS2,6,126.88,127.48,0.6,4.0,Because like.
35914,PS2,6,127.48,136.2,8.72,2.0,"People had an incentive to fall or like what Trump is doing, but mostly just because they were like hardcore physical like constraints in reality that prevented things from happening."
35914,PS2,6,136.4,146.88,10.48,2.0,"So I think the more complicated you make a system, the more prone it is to like failures or minor like discomforts that needs fixing."
35914,PS2,6,147.28,159.8,12.52,2.0,"So if you simplify the supply chain into something that's, you know, much more linear, much more direct, then it's going to be like easy."
35914,PS2,6,161.16,164.68,3.52,5.0,"Yeah, and that's where things like AI potentially could come in."
35914,PS2,6,166.4,166.88,0.48,2.0,The odd sense.
35914,PS2,6,168.08,179.8,11.72,5.0,"Yeah, if there's, if there are a lot of like middle men or, you know, parties in the in the middle, like reducing the number of actors."
35914,PS2,6,182.2,183.88,1.68,2.0,"IE banned international trade, yeah."
35914,PS2,6,185.88,188.84,2.96,3.0,I was going to ask what does that mean in practice in terms of making it more linear and?
35914,PS2,6,189.08,190.4,1.32,2.0,"You know, yeah, exactly."
35914,PS2,6,190.4,205.32,14.92,2.0,"And in that sense, it's basically amounting to saying, well, we're going to actually reduce the party that are involved in this, which obviously necessitates that, OK, previous parties that are involved now needs to be kicked out once in a while just to make sure that it's more leaner."
35914,PS2,6,205.32,207.12,1.8,2.0,"Obviously, the cost is probably going to go up."
35914,PS2,6,207.28,213.84,6.56,2.0,"You're probably going to be relying more on local producers rather than international ones so that you don't have to think about shipping companies, for example."
35914,PS2,6,214.16,229.04,14.88,2.0,"Or you're going to learn more towards buying, you know, more like final products rather than the intermediaries during which you then have to rely on maybe another party to like manufacture into the final product that you then maybe retail."
35914,PS2,6,229.36,252.16,22.8,2.0,"So in that case, we're probably looking at a world where it's going to be dominated by local monopolies that basically holds sort of like a regional control, almost like a cartel thing, but that don't necessarily have like as strong of a competitive like capacity internationally."
35914,PS2,6,252.56,266.4,13.84,3.0,"But surely that's not good for the consumer, because those local monopolies can sit in a way we're disadvantaging the more fragmented part of the population, which are the tumors, which are maybe should be more protected they have, because they have less power in the first place in my world."
35914,PS2,6,267.68,267.72,0.04,2.0,I.
35914,PS2,6,268.28,271.72,3.44,3.0,Don't know about your world but.
35914,PS2,6,272.84,272.96,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,274.4,274.8,0.4,4.0,Surely.
35914,PS2,6,274.8,275.0,0.2,2.0,If he.
35914,PS2,6,275.0,275.6,0.6,4.0,Did ban.
35914,PS2,6,275.6,286.0,10.4,1.0,"International trade though, wouldn't a lot of countries start trying to reform an empire so they can be like, Oh yeah the US has not taken over China so we can use all their materials?"
35914,PS2,6,286.96,287.12,0.16,5.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,287.4,288.56,1.16,4.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35914,PS2,6,288.84,296.92,8.08,3.0,Like I feel like the incentives when you eliminate the collaboration element end up being each for their own in terms of countries.
35914,PS2,6,297.08,300.92,3.84,3.0,So then you get things like these where which you know are not fair anyway.
35914,PS2,6,300.92,301.6,0.68,3.0,So typically like.
35914,PS2,6,302.0,304.64,2.64,2.0,I guess not so creative way for this.
35914,PS2,6,304.64,317.36,12.72,2.0,"It's just basically to increase competitive level in the market such that you have a diversified portfolio that you then can like sort of mitigate your risk on so, so."
35914,PS2,6,317.84,318.2,0.36,1.0,How?
35914,PS2,6,318.2,318.96,0.76,1.0,How do you do that?
35914,PS2,6,319.96,333.32,13.36,2.0,"That would look like, for example, having multiple like basically if you as a company would want to like increase like strength of your supply chain, then you would be basically investing in multiple locations."
35914,PS2,6,333.32,340.4,7.08,2.0,"For example, we built up different factories in different countries so that if one country goes into a pandemic or something like, the other countries are still fine, right?"
35914,PS2,6,341.52,347.44,5.92,2.0,So diversify your investment and production portfolio or also like your sourcing portfolio.
35914,PS2,6,347.44,360.24,12.8,2.0,"So instead of from buying like I guess your raw material from this one single village or this one single factory, you then basically try to source them from like 4-5, six different countries, right?"
35914,PS2,6,360.96,361.4,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,361.68,361.84,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,361.84,363.72,1.88,3.0,"No, I think that would that would be good and that would make sense."
35914,PS2,6,363.72,372.04,8.32,3.0,"But also perhaps identifying what are some of the key points in your supply chain process that you might want to keep locally because they're crucial to whatever it is that you're doing, right?"
35914,PS2,6,372.24,378.44,6.2,3.0,"Because then those points, I guess I don't know, yeah, are more important than the the rest, assuming the world is an old burned down."
35914,PS2,6,380.6,383.28,2.68,2.0,"But I mean, people don't do them for economic reasons as well."
35914,PS2,6,383.28,384.24,0.96,2.0,Precisely right.
35914,PS2,6,389.4,390.36,0.96,1.0,So we can with.
35914,PS2,6,390.84,392.56,1.72,2.0,Portfolio diversity.
35914,PS2,6,393.2,400.12,6.92,5.0,"I mean, it's, I guess it's not the most creative, but it's very practical."
35914,PS2,6,400.2,401.44,1.24,5.0,It's a practical solution.
35914,PS2,6,406.56,409.08,2.52,1.0,Diversified portfolio through competitive did.
35914,PS2,6,409.08,425.0,15.92,2.0,"You say like increased level of competitive, like increased level of competition inside the market so that there are basically multiple producers for the same item and multiple suppliers for the same item allowing."
35914,PS2,6,425.04,425.52,0.48,4.0,You to.
35914,PS2,6,425.68,430.68,5.0,2.0,Basically substitute better in terms of I guess.
35914,PS2,6,432.92,448.52,15.6,5.0,"I guess in a way you'd have to for certain things you'd have to almost hype up like whatever that product is in a way, like to actually make lots of people want to produce it, right?"
35914,PS2,6,450.96,459.8,8.84,5.0,"Like if if you just said to people, oh, start making, you know, plastic bricks, Like, where's the incentive relief to to."
35914,PS2,6,459.8,460.24,0.44,2.0,Do that.
35914,PS2,6,460.28,461.36,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, exactly so."
35914,PS2,6,461.72,468.4,6.68,2.0,"I mean, companies wants to divest from China to invest into like what what India or like surrounding countries, but they lack a lot of like."
35914,PS2,6,468.44,469.36,0.92,4.0,Basic infrastructures.
35914,PS2,6,469.92,470.72,0.8,2.0,"Right, so."
35914,PS2,6,470.72,471.0,0.28,3.0,In that.
35914,PS2,6,471.0,477.92,6.92,2.0,Case like obviously International Development for these countries before they can actually become integrated into the market is also quite relevant.
35914,PS2,6,479.6,499.16,19.56,2.0,"So pursuing developmental programs to encourage, I guess the incorporation of more members into the so the network, yeah, so that you have like sort of a supply web instead of a supply chain."
35914,PS2,6,500.2,500.36,0.16,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,501.92,502.36,0.44,6.0,That makes sense.
35914,PS2,6,502.36,503.68,1.32,6.0,So we're we're competing with creative.
35914,PS2,6,503.92,505.0,1.08,6.0,"Creative was AI, right?"
35914,PS2,6,505.44,507.84,2.4,6.0,I guess AI would never say like ban international trade.
35914,PS2,6,509.08,511.72,2.64,3.0,We go I could delete all this and go back to banning some trade you're.
35914,PS2,6,512.92,513.56,0.64,5.0,More creative.
35914,PS2,6,517.4,519.56,2.16,1.0,"So what I've written down, it's basically what you said."
35914,PS2,6,519.72,520.88,1.16,1.0,I just typed your word for word.
35914,PS2,6,521.24,526.52,5.28,1.0,"The 1st 5 portfolio through increased competition within the market, meaning there are multiple producers and suppliers for the same item."
35914,PS2,6,526.52,531.08,4.56,1.0,We need to increase the value of individual products to inspire more producers and suppliers to manufacture it.
35914,PS2,6,531.32,537.8,6.48,1.0,"Pursue developmental programs to encourage incorporation of more members into the supply network, creating supply web instead of supply chain."
35914,PS2,6,538.28,550.44,12.16,2.0,"I think we can like sort of nicely incorporate that ban international trade answer into this by basically using Trump's 25% tariff as a threat for firms that do not want to integrate, OK."
35914,PS2,6,563.36,563.96,0.6,1.0,Anything else?
35914,PS2,6,565.08,565.28,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,565.28,579.8,14.52,2.0,"So, so in that sense, like sort of building on to that idea, you can probably like sort of come up with most likely legislative measures to quote UN quote, encourage firms in diversifying their portfolio by literally just be like, I'm going to slash you with 20% tax if you don't."
35914,PS2,6,583.96,594.72,10.76,2.0,"But obviously that cost is going to eventually come to the consumer, not that it's economically sound, but for secure like supply chain security, it probably like is ideal."
35914,PS2,6,595.08,611.44,16.36,2.0,"And if we're looking at resources that are more pertinent to say, national security purposes like food that a country might most likely want to be self reliant on, then it's probably actually ideal that you do do some form of like policy intervention."
35914,PS2,6,613.24,616.56,3.32,3.0,"Yeah, I guess I don't know if we're increasing cost on the consumer."
35914,PS2,6,616.56,619.8,3.24,3.0,"And the way I would see it is at least if we do it, let's do it for a good reason, right?"
35914,PS2,6,620.16,628.84,8.68,3.0,"So I guess, you know, ensuring supply chain security by basically slashing companies that don't want to comply with it is one way."
35914,PS2,6,629.08,641.68,12.6,3.0,"On the other hand, I think 1 interesting thought would be maybe let's help countries that provide raw materials actually be able to exploit their resources themselves instead of us, you know, just going there, making use of their resources in our supply chains."
35914,PS2,6,642.2,650.92,8.72,3.0,"So obviously that would maybe increase cost in the consumer as well, because as they develop, they start putting more of their own resources and then they grow their own sort of like capacity, industry and so on."
35914,PS2,6,651.24,654.92,3.68,3.0,"And then that would pass on cost to the consumer, but at least it would be for good reason."
35914,PS2,6,655.2,655.44,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35914,PS2,6,655.56,655.68,0.12,2.0,Yeah.

35914,PS2,6,659.04,662.64,3.6,3.0,"So I don't know, Yeah, framing it more that way, I think, think about."
35914,PS2,6,662.64,666.76,4.12,2.0,It like domestic supply chain for that good might actually improve because of that precise.
35914,PS2,6,666.76,667.08,0.32,4.0,Reason.
35914,PS2,6,668.56,669.08,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35914,PS2,6,669.12,675.8,6.68,3.0,"And in a way, maybe it would actually be even more secure because then you actually have members in your network rather than just so it feeds."
35914,PS2,6,675.8,676.12,0.32,2.0,Back to.
35914,PS2,6,676.2,676.56,0.36,3.0,The same.
35914,PS2,6,676.72,681.28,4.56,2.0,Idea of like International Development being helpful to increase competition.
35914,PS2,6,688.28,688.44,0.16,2.0,Cool.
35914,PS2,6,688.44,688.56,0.12,2.0,Well.

36321,PS2,6,46.92,49.52,2.6,1.0,Seems like something will happen during the COVID.
36321,PS2,6,53.0,54.88,1.88,1.0,This Russian in supply train.
36321,PS2,6,61.16,61.8,0.64,1.0,What kind of?
36321,PS2,6,61.8,62.72,0.92,2.0,Vulnerabilities.
36321,PS2,6,63.96,65.84,1.88,3.0,"Yeah, they should have been more specific."
36321,PS2,6,65.84,66.24,0.4,4.0,Yeah.
36321,PS2,6,66.64,69.36,2.72,3.0,"I mean, if you know the problem then we can find a solution, right?"
36321,PS2,6,69.36,69.64,0.28,3.0,Like.
36321,PS2,6,69.92,71.12,1.2,5.0,Or maybe we can like.
36321,PS2,6,71.24,72.56,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, we can assume something."
36321,PS2,6,72.56,72.88,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, assume."
36321,PS2,6,72.96,76.2,3.24,4.0,"Something happens, Yeah, it is more like supplicing security."
36321,PS2,6,76.4,78.4,2.0,4.0,So it's like a security problem.
36321,PS2,6,79.52,79.96,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
36321,PS2,6,82.84,83.72,0.88,3.0,I think that's not.
36321,PS2,6,83.76,84.36,0.6,3.0,I think no.
36321,PS2,6,84.64,86.08,1.44,3.0,I think in general it just means.
36321,PS2,6,90.16,100.76,10.6,1.0,Maybe you can just kind of some general ideas I is it.
36321,PS2,6,103.56,115.16,11.6,5.0,Kind of like have more label to like support the it's a plenty like more people work on or have the kind of like backup peoples.
36321,PS2,6,115.28,116.0,0.72,2.0,And that's what I was.
36321,PS2,6,116.0,116.6,0.6,5.0,Thinking.
36321,PS2,6,116.84,118.72,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, we can have backup plan."
36321,PS2,6,119.04,127.76,8.72,4.0,But also more automation because for example in the face and deliver schedules it it is a problem that could be resolved if there was more automation.
36321,PS2,6,129.36,129.72,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
36321,PS2,6,129.96,135.68,5.72,4.0,Like best better schedule arrangements and this could be automated.
36321,PS2,6,136.68,136.76,0.08,1.0,You.
36321,PS2,6,137.12,137.88,0.76,6.0,Mean you mean.
36321,PS2,6,138.28,139.48,1.2,1.0,Optimize the schedule.
36321,PS2,6,140.4,141.88,1.48,6.0,And doing a network.
36321,PS2,6,142.76,147.64,4.88,4.0,And no like to to cover is automate automated systems like.
36321,PS2,6,147.72,148.12,0.4,6.0,AI.
36321,PS2,6,148.8,150.04,1.24,5.0,To because.
36321,PS2,6,150.04,151.64,1.6,4.0,These are like technical tasks.
36321,PS2,6,152.64,161.96,9.32,4.0,The cost and the driver schedules are like technical tasks that could basically be done by AI or something like that.
36321,PS2,6,162.44,164.56,2.12,4.0,"And good micro process, more effacing."
36321,PS2,6,165.12,176.76,11.64,3.0,"In general, more automation like, you know, let's say, basically replacing a lot of labour intensive steps with AI with sorry, with automation like let's say packing because how much?"
36321,PS2,6,176.76,187.0,10.24,3.0,"Because when we say, because I was thinking about labour like you or but how much, let's say whatever backup we have that will only increase cost, but automation doesn't matter."
36321,PS2,6,187.8,187.92,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
36321,PS2,6,192.28,193.24,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
36321,PS2,6,193.28,195.68,2.4,2.0,You can just try automation of various.
36321,PS2,6,196.76,201.24,4.48,1.0,Prior automation system or?
36321,PS2,6,202.36,205.28,2.92,4.0,To improve systems efficiency.
36321,PS2,6,211.48,211.84,0.36,1.0,Efficiency.
36321,PS2,6,215.6,216.76,1.16,6.0,So we like expand.

36321,PS2,6,219.92,220.64,0.72,6.0,Think maybe?
36321,PS2,6,220.64,225.8,5.16,6.0,We can use more robots to replace the human mistakes.
36321,PS2,6,226.92,227.2,0.28,4.0,Yes.
36321,PS2,6,238.8,240.4,1.6,2.0,You can write replace.

34326,PS2,3,105.88,106.36,0.48,2.0,This.
34326,PS2,3,123.92,125.88,1.96,2.0,"OK, this is an interesting."
34326,PS2,3,126.6,126.84,0.24,1.0,Ready.
34326,PS2,3,126.84,128.8,1.96,1.0,Let's see the topic Chewy.
34326,PS2,3,129.32,131.2,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, let's go with topic #1."
34326,PS2,3,152.52,156.64,4.12,1.0,"OK, OK, so I'll just."
34326,PS2,3,157.2,157.4,0.2,2.0,Since.
34326,PS2,3,157.4,159.92,2.52,1.0,"There's no, no, no work within there."
34326,PS2,3,160.96,163.24,2.28,1.0,I'll just throw up some crazy.
34326,PS2,3,163.32,163.48,0.16,3.0,Idea.
34326,PS2,3,163.48,169.08,5.6,3.0,"Actually for this, I think Derek will have a good idea because he deals the supply chain and he does the cost."
34326,PS2,3,170.04,173.16,3.12,3.0,I'm not quite sure whether he can do the delivery schedules.
34326,PS2,3,176.4,177.12,0.72,3.0,"So first, I'm sorry."
34326,PS2,3,179.0,179.92,0.92,1.0,"Don't, don't look in my."
34326,PS2,3,180.32,181.88,1.56,3.0,Supply chain security.
34326,PS2,3,182.04,183.76,1.72,3.0,So what the supply chain security means?
34326,PS2,3,184.28,189.36,5.08,2.0,"I think when we talk about supply chain security, think about COVID as an example."
34326,PS2,3,189.44,189.96,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, right."
34326,PS2,3,190.08,190.24,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
34326,PS2,3,191.32,191.52,0.2,2.0,You.
34326,PS2,3,191.6,202.44,10.84,2.0,"You have for you have worldwide supply chain centres for certain product, let's say for example, semiconductor product."
34326,PS2,3,202.8,211.28,8.48,2.0,"Taiwan and I don't know, South Korea are the main, are the are the main countries to deliver this product, correct."
34326,PS2,3,211.8,222.72,10.92,2.0,"During COVID, because of the workforce shortage, those countries were not able to produce semiconductors and due to that the price of semiconductor went up crazily."
34326,PS2,3,223.16,226.24,3.08,1.0,"Yeah, and you could not buy the PS-5."
34326,PS2,3,226.48,227.2,0.72,2.0,Exactly.
34326,PS2,3,227.2,229.32,2.12,1.0,Because because there's a shop supply.
34326,PS2,3,230.96,244.76,13.8,2.0,Chips and even cars if you are like in car car manufacturing you you buy a car they say no there is no AC car there there is no ACC system because there were no chips available to inbuilt it right.
34326,PS2,3,244.76,255.56,10.8,2.0,"So this is what we call supply chain security due to due to some unforeseeable events, right?"
34326,PS2,3,255.96,265.52,9.56,2.0,"It, it creates supply chain shortage that do not allow you to meet the demand of the product that you usually supply."
34326,PS2,3,265.84,281.0,15.16,2.0,These are the vulnerability one of the approach that's so many because this is my industry and I've seen that a lot of company have now ceased to supply to have not ceased to source product from supply.
34326,PS2,3,281.16,287.8,6.64,2.0,"Supply chain centres like China, South Korea, Thailand, they try to be closer to those centres, so those."
34326,PS2,3,288.56,288.96,0.4,1.0,Centres.
34326,PS2,3,290.04,290.88,0.84,2.0,Means near shoring.
34326,PS2,3,291.76,292.4,0.64,1.0,Near shore.
34326,PS2,3,292.6,296.76,4.16,2.0,Near shoring so so you can take it as a keywords.
34326,PS2,3,297.32,308.28,10.96,2.0,So near shoring is one of the aspect that could help to reduce the shop the the supply chain near showing.
34326,PS2,3,308.28,309.4,1.12,2.0,"It's one word, by the way."
34326,PS2,3,310.32,310.6,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, near."
34326,PS2,3,310.72,310.92,0.2,2.0,Sharing.
34326,PS2,3,311.32,313.96,2.64,1.0,"Yeah, near sharing your source of supply being."
34326,PS2,3,313.96,316.44,2.48,2.0,"Close to your yeah, to your source of supply, but."
34326,PS2,3,316.8,321.44,4.64,1.0,What if your market is in US but you have been getting a supply from China?
34326,PS2,3,321.44,321.84,0.4,1.0,How to?
34326,PS2,3,322.4,325.6,3.2,2.0,Near sharing simply means produce from Mexico.
34326,PS2,3,325.6,327.96,2.36,2.0,Because Mexico is as cheap as the US.
34326,PS2,3,328.08,328.36,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
34326,PS2,3,329.84,331.04,1.2,1.0,It's close to the US.
34326,PS2,3,331.12,332.44,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, OK, that's one of my."
34326,PS2,3,332.44,334.48,2.04,1.0,But we need some creativity here.
34326,PS2,3,335.12,339.4,4.28,1.0,"So yeah, there's something happening in future."
34326,PS2,3,339.4,341.32,1.92,1.0,I'm sure that AI knows about this.
34326,PS2,3,341.32,343.4,2.08,2.0,"Right, right, right, right."
34326,PS2,3,343.4,343.48,0.08,2.0,So.
34326,PS2,3,345.96,355.84,9.88,1.0,"We need to think of something which has not been happening in reality yet, but sounds feasible or practical."
34326,PS2,3,355.84,357.96,2.12,2.0,"Yeah, surely has never happened in reality."
34326,PS2,3,358.84,359.24,0.4,1.0,Why?
34326,PS2,3,359.84,366.52,6.68,2.0,"Because pretty much in the world at the moment, every single one was focusing on sourcing."
34326,PS2,3,366.52,371.56,5.04,1.0,"Where it is cheap, still OK, still they still haven't learned the full lesson of COVID."
34326,PS2,3,371.76,372.44,0.68,2.0,Exactly.
34326,PS2,3,372.76,383.08,10.32,2.0,So COVID where COVID was a revelation that we are going to run out of tissue paper just because we are sourcing all our tissue paper from China.
34326,PS2,3,383.24,385.88,2.64,2.0,"OK, you you get what I mean Will."
34326,PS2,3,386.56,387.0,0.44,3.0,"Yeah, I know."
34326,PS2,3,387.16,390.68,3.52,3.0,"But OK, that force within this one of the vulnerable."
34326,PS2,3,390.68,394.0,3.32,2.0,"Vulnerability and, she said, create ideas."
34326,PS2,3,394.24,405.68,11.44,3.0,"But this sentence to Taco supply chain security, so you've got to link your vulner, the one exact vulnerability that you're trying to solve that is part of this."
34326,PS2,3,405.68,411.68,6.0,3.0,And then that's a creative idea or #2 supply chain security as a whole.
34326,PS2,3,413.04,414.64,1.6,3.0,And then what idea to tackle this?
34326,PS2,3,414.92,419.96,5.04,2.0,"Yeah, I think one of the vulnerabilities is political instabilities."
34326,PS2,3,420.16,422.96,2.8,2.0,"Yes, political instabilities from one country to the other."
34326,PS2,3,422.96,424.36,1.4,2.0,Look at Ukraine today.
34326,PS2,3,424.96,428.48,3.52,2.0,You can used to be one of the major supplier of steel manufacturing.
34326,PS2,3,429.52,429.8,0.28,1.0,Right.
34326,PS2,3,430.28,437.0,6.72,2.0,"And due to the fact that there is war in Ukraine right now, the price of or the the price of steel went up crazily."
34326,PS2,3,437.52,445.84,8.32,2.0,"Similarly, Russia, Russia is one of the main manufacturer of of gas product due to the war in Ukraine, right?"
34326,PS2,3,446.12,453.8,7.68,2.0,Almost multiple countries in the EU decided not to source gas from Russia anymore.
34326,PS2,3,454.16,458.28,4.12,2.0,Therefore it creates this supply chain of vulnerability.
34326,PS2,3,458.76,465.52,6.76,2.0,"But how do you tackle that, the ideas that we are sort of transforming right now?"
34326,PS2,3,467.88,469.28,1.4,1.0,I don't know why it's not projecting to a.
34326,PS2,3,469.28,471.92,2.64,1.0,Basically everybody can look at it.
34326,PS2,3,471.96,474.4,2.44,1.0,"Sorry, I don't know why the signal doesn't comes back."
34326,PS2,3,476.84,484.88,8.04,3.0,"So unless I thought our sustainability frameworks would be useful here, the scenario analysis would be very useful here."
34326,PS2,3,486.44,487.8,1.36,3.0,"Actually, we have 5 more minutes."
34326,PS2,3,491.36,494.04,2.68,2.0,How to tackle political instability?
34326,PS2,3,496.84,500.88,4.04,2.0,What What would be one of the most creative approach of tribal political instability?
34326,PS2,3,506.84,520.12,13.28,3.0,"Why you do what Apple do you diversify your supply chain to geographically from China, You diversify to Vietnam because the cost in China is going up and then the cost was further driven up by COVID."
34326,PS2,3,520.12,520.44,0.32,3.0,I want the.
34326,PS2,3,521.52,525.0,3.48,1.0,"I want the question to be yes, yes, very good."
34326,PS2,3,525.56,530.84,5.28,1.0,"I mean, I mean, humankind rely on division of labour to produce what we need every day."
34326,PS2,3,530.96,545.56,14.6,1.0,"Yeah, If we need to perfectly, perfectly tackled to supply chain security, it means that we have to make everything we need by ourselves."
34326,PS2,3,546.24,556.52,10.28,1.0,"If I mean as long as there is an exchange of goods and service even between two persons, there is a reliability of supply chain."
34326,PS2,3,557.08,569.6,12.52,1.0,"If I want Derek to teach me something Subject A, or he relies on me to teach him subject B, there is a risk that if he's sick or he's been feeling unwell, then I lost my teacher, right?"
34326,PS2,3,569.6,570.76,1.16,1.0,"Yeah, so."
34326,PS2,3,570.8,571.04,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34326,PS2,3,571.04,572.32,1.28,3.0,So therefore Joran.
34326,PS2,3,572.56,572.68,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
34326,PS2,3,572.68,574.92,2.24,3.0,So therefore you just rely on Derek.
34326,PS2,3,575.4,576.96,1.56,3.0,You also need to be friend.
34326,PS2,3,576.96,577.28,0.32,3.0,I don't know.
34326,PS2,3,577.4,579.08,1.68,1.0,"JP Yeah, that's the reality."
34326,PS2,3,579.28,579.6,0.32,3.0,Jordan.
34326,PS2,3,580.08,581.72,1.64,1.0,"Yeah, so get rid of this."
34326,PS2,3,581.88,582.96,1.08,2.0,Kind of simple approach.
34326,PS2,3,583.2,584.16,0.96,1.0,I still I just.
34326,PS2,3,584.16,589.36,5.2,2.0,Putting all your the simple approach could be not to put all your eggs.
34326,PS2,3,590.64,591.88,1.24,1.0,In one bag.
34326,PS2,3,592.16,592.56,0.4,3.0,In one bag.
34326,PS2,3,593.12,594.16,1.04,2.0,Try to diversify.
34326,PS2,3,594.32,596.28,1.96,1.0,Diversify your source of supply.
34326,PS2,3,596.52,605.92,9.4,2.0,"Diversify your Yeah, but this is also again a response that AI would give you right away."
34326,PS2,3,606.04,606.28,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34326,PS2,3,606.28,608.32,2.04,2.0,So we are requested to be.
34326,PS2,3,609.24,611.0,1.76,2.0,We are requested here to be creative.
34326,PS2,3,611.52,613.56,2.04,3.0,"Actually, the part is the creative part, the."
34326,PS2,3,613.56,615.16,1.6,2.0,Creativity part is what mattered.
34326,PS2,3,615.76,619.6,3.84,2.0,I would rather say we start to write because we have only three minutes.
34326,PS2,3,620.6,620.8,0.2,2.0,Yes.
34326,PS2,3,620.8,627.76,6.96,2.0,So near shoring has one of the two ideas and you can write what near shoring means in a sense.
34326,PS2,3,629.76,631.28,1.52,2.0,Sourcing closer.
34326,PS2,3,631.72,634.56,2.84,2.0,"Sourcing close, yeah."
34326,PS2,3,635.16,637.36,2.2,1.0,Means sourcing.
34326,PS2,3,637.36,637.92,0.56,2.0,Closer to.
34326,PS2,3,637.92,643.68,5.76,1.0,Home run close geographical location.
34326,PS2,3,643.72,644.16,0.44,2.0,Yes.
34326,PS2,3,645.76,646.24,0.48,1.0,Geographical.
34326,PS2,3,646.48,651.12,4.64,2.0,Location to wish you have better control over.
34326,PS2,3,651.36,657.08,5.72,1.0,Better accessibility and control over.
34326,PS2,3,657.8,661.96,4.16,2.0,"Over your supply chain, upstream, upstream and downstream."
34326,PS2,3,661.96,662.4,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, downstream."
34326,PS2,3,663.2,670.04,6.84,1.0,"And downstream suppliers, yeah."
34326,PS2,3,670.68,676.92,6.24,2.0,"The other, the other aspect is again, geopolitical conflicts."
34326,PS2,3,677.88,678.96,1.08,2.0,How do we address that?
34326,PS2,3,678.96,681.76,2.8,2.0,"No, no, you go to the next next."
34326,PS2,3,682.6,682.92,0.32,1.0,Parallel.
34326,PS2,3,683.12,687.72,4.6,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, maybe 1 just."
34326,PS2,3,688.08,695.2,7.12,1.0,Just to consider the source 8 minutes.
34326,PS2,3,697.28,697.56,0.28,2.0,OK.
34326,PS2,3,699.4,699.76,0.36,2.0,OK.
34326,PS2,3,699.76,699.88,0.12,2.0,OK.
34326,PS2,3,699.92,704.96,5.04,2.0,"So geopolitical instability, geopolitical instability could."
34326,PS2,3,705.0,706.68,1.68,1.0,Cause can be resolved by near sourcing.
34326,PS2,3,706.68,722.88,16.2,1.0,"So if if the western country and the eastern country are going to disassociate like China government trade with Russia and US only trade with Australia, Europe and and Canada."
34326,PS2,3,723.56,727.48,3.92,1.0,"So it's also kind of new, new sourcing."
34326,PS2,3,728.0,729.04,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34326,PS2,3,729.08,737.08,8.0,2.0,"But but with geopolitical instability, I refer to how do we address the problem, right, geopolitical instability."
34326,PS2,3,737.08,738.16,1.08,1.0,We have a creative idea.
34326,PS2,3,738.32,738.6,0.28,1.0,Let's.
34326,PS2,3,738.64,739.12,0.48,2.0,Make.
34326,PS2,3,739.76,743.48,3.72,1.0,"The whole world in one country, so there will be no geopolitical conflict."
34326,PS2,3,743.76,744.24,0.48,2.0,Correct.
34326,PS2,3,744.36,745.72,1.36,2.0,That's a good creative idea.
34326,PS2,3,745.72,746.12,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
34326,PS2,3,749.32,751.76,2.44,1.0,"To tackle, I mean, I want something."
34326,PS2,3,752.08,755.48,3.4,2.0,"We need, we should, yeah, to tackle geopolitical instability."
34326,PS2,3,755.48,758.44,2.96,2.0,Tackle geopolitical instability.
34326,PS2,3,758.6,766.36,7.76,1.0,"Yeah, in supply chain insecurity."
34326,PS2,3,767.56,778.2,10.64,3.0,"I don't know actually what Singapore does is that we just have the sovereign well fund buy on the vaccines so that yeah, we have first dips on all your vaccines, but that's just one of the things."
34326,PS2,3,779.08,779.36,0.28,1.0,"Yeah, to."
34326,PS2,3,781.2,781.88,0.68,2.0,Create a global.
34326,PS2,3,782.16,785.8,3.64,1.0,A global How to say?
34326,PS2,3,786.72,788.56,1.84,2.0,A global union or a global?
34326,PS2,3,791.48,792.28,0.8,2.0,"No, No, no, no."

34250,PS2,3,542.12,546.52,4.4,1.0,"That's one, that's one digital security, you know, like last time, there's somebody better."
34250,PS2,3,546.52,553.24,6.72,1.0,This software where like this little animated figure will start eating your files if you do too slowly.
34250,PS2,3,554.04,555.84,1.8,1.0,"But it's good if you do your work too, too slowly, right?"
34250,PS2,3,555.84,556.64,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, they're slacking off."
34250,PS2,3,556.68,558.12,1.44,1.0,That person will start eating your files.
34250,PS2,3,558.48,559.52,1.04,1.0,Then you cannot access your files.
34250,PS2,3,560.16,560.92,0.76,3.0,Your files.
34250,PS2,3,561.28,563.28,2.0,1.0,"Obviously, you know, like you have icons on your computer."
34250,PS2,3,563.36,563.6,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34250,PS2,3,563.6,565.04,1.44,1.0,"So like, it's to prevent slacking."
34250,PS2,3,565.04,565.96,0.92,1.0,So you procrastinate.
34250,PS2,3,565.96,567.92,1.96,1.0,The person will start eating your files as you go.
34250,PS2,3,568.32,569.96,1.64,1.0,Then you cannot click on your files on your computer.
34250,PS2,3,569.96,570.76,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, on your computer."
34250,PS2,3,570.76,571.64,0.88,1.0,Like it's like what is?
34250,PS2,3,571.88,572.08,0.2,3.0,Files.
34250,PS2,3,572.08,572.8,0.72,3.0,"What's So you know, OK."
34250,PS2,3,572.92,576.16,3.24,1.0,"So, you know, there's shortcuts on your computer screen."
34250,PS2,3,576.16,576.4,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
34250,PS2,3,576.6,582.52,5.92,1.0,"So if you do too slowly, the person, the person will sit there and just start eating your files and then you will lose all your shortcuts."
34250,PS2,3,582.76,583.36,0.6,3.0,So you need to fast.
34250,PS2,3,583.72,586.08,2.36,1.0,"Cut before they will speed up everything and give it back to you, yeah."
34250,PS2,3,588.56,589.6,1.04,3.0,"OK, how would it be applied?"
34250,PS2,3,591.08,598.84,7.76,1.0,"Yeah, we need something similar to you, but OK, let's say vulnerabilities in supply chain, we can say like cyber security as well, we see."
34250,PS2,3,599.2,599.56,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
34250,PS2,3,599.8,600.48,0.68,1.0,"OK, then we."
34250,PS2,3,600.6,608.6,8.0,3.0,"See so there from Lebanon, we say that cyber security OK, so how to prevent, you know, hackers to access our system?"
34250,PS2,3,608.6,611.56,2.96,3.0,"OK, I'll do that."
34250,PS2,3,612.84,613.28,0.44,3.0,Create some.
34250,PS2,3,613.64,614.64,1.0,1.0,Short the interesting one.
34250,PS2,3,614.64,616.08,1.44,1.0,Do you know how is it currently being done?
34250,PS2,3,616.2,618.88,2.68,1.0,How does that I know?
34250,PS2,3,619.0,621.32,2.32,1.0,"Let's copy what's being done, Yes, How is it currently being done?"
34250,PS2,3,621.36,621.48,0.12,1.0,Right.
34250,PS2,3,621.48,624.4,2.92,1.0,The whole Internet is essentially by lava lens.
34250,PS2,3,624.76,626.32,1.56,1.0,I think it's shocking can very later.
34250,PS2,3,626.32,636.12,9.8,1.0,Do you know about this so how to determine the random and the coding of cybersecurity so they use lava lamps and then that that translates to numbers yeah.
34250,PS2,3,636.12,641.16,5.04,1.0,So we can do the same thing So let's say we can we can have like I don't know like maybe 5 hamsters.
34250,PS2,3,641.16,642.0,0.84,1.0,This is what I'm thinking.
34250,PS2,3,642.0,642.64,0.64,1.0,5 hamsters.
34250,PS2,3,642.68,649.48,6.8,1.0,"And then based on the number of times they, they should, let's say per day, yeah, you get a different code every single day."
34250,PS2,3,649.64,649.92,0.28,1.0,That way.
34250,PS2,3,650.08,653.84,3.76,1.0,"You encrypt like you, you order immersion."
34250,PS2,3,653.84,656.24,2.4,1.0,"Yes, I think more basically."
34250,PS2,3,656.24,658.72,2.48,1.0,So you know how the Germans change it every single day?
34250,PS2,3,659.28,659.72,0.44,3.0,Oh yes.
34250,PS2,3,660.8,665.36,4.56,1.0,So what what is currently happening Internet now is they use lava lamps literally.
34250,PS2,3,665.36,667.64,2.28,1.0,"So because they cannot put it, yeah, you're going to read it's true."
34250,PS2,3,668.4,670.0,1.6,3.0,Let's just like change their codes.
34250,PS2,3,670.16,675.24,5.08,1.0,"So the lava lamp, so there's a camera monitoring for the lava lens, because the lava lens is random."
34250,PS2,3,675.4,675.6,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
34250,PS2,3,675.8,677.04,1.24,1.0,So each one of them gives a model.
34250,PS2,3,677.04,677.44,0.4,3.0,Number.
34250,PS2,3,677.44,677.84,0.4,3.0,Oh my.
34250,PS2,3,678.4,679.88,1.48,2.0,"God lamps are random, are you?"
34250,PS2,3,679.92,680.64,0.72,1.0,"Sure, yes, it is."
34250,PS2,3,680.72,681.88,1.16,1.0,You can you can really it's true.
34250,PS2,3,681.88,687.4,5.52,1.0,You're going to be about lava lamp and the cyber security is legit so we can do something you just using animals like how many times they.
34250,PS2,3,688.2,688.88,0.68,3.0,"With the toilet, how?"
34250,PS2,3,688.88,692.0,3.12,1.0,"Many times they go to the toilet or how much they pee, how many seconds they pee."
34250,PS2,3,692.0,693.2,1.2,1.0,Maybe that was That's another.
34250,PS2,3,693.68,694.92,1.24,3.0,Way how many times with the cat?
34250,PS2,3,696.6,699.16,2.56,3.0,"Yeah, that sounds good."
34250,PS2,3,699.16,702.16,3.0,3.0,"Yeah, that's good idea."
34250,PS2,3,702.88,709.16,6.28,1.0,"Cyber security affecting, yeah, the supply that."
34250,PS2,3,710.24,711.08,0.84,3.0,Was difficult.
34250,PS2,3,711.24,712.88,1.64,3.0,This is strange question.
34250,PS2,3,712.88,713.84,0.96,3.0,That was just strange.
34250,PS2,3,713.84,717.96,4.12,3.0,"Yeah, the usual was much nice."
34250,PS2,3,719.32,733.56,14.24,1.0,Can be safeguarded safeguard by checking the random the random.
34250,PS2,3,734.44,735.64,1.2,2.0,Like a master cat is.
34250,PS2,3,735.84,739.32,3.48,1.0,"It yeah, the random binary is that what's the name?"
34250,PS2,3,739.32,740.4,1.08,1.0,I can't remember.
34250,PS2,3,741.12,742.04,0.92,1.0,By tracking.
34250,PS2,3,743.4,752.68,9.28,1.0,"OK, let's say by by creating notes, notes formed by by creating notes."
34250,PS2,3,753.44,754.48,1.04,1.0,Let me how how that face is.
34250,PS2,3,755.12,756.04,0.92,1.0,I think it's saying that.
34250,PS2,3,756.2,757.08,0.88,2.0,You want to create a.
34250,PS2,3,757.44,757.92,0.48,1.0,Secret code?
34250,PS2,3,758.0,758.8,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, a secret code."
34250,PS2,3,758.84,760.2,1.36,1.0,So basically like based.
34250,PS2,3,760.48,761.48,1.0,2.0,On the randomness of.
34250,PS2,3,761.8,765.0,3.2,1.0,The so how how the write is by creating secret.
34250,PS2,3,766.16,769.44,3.28,1.0,The encryption means like you need to do the action what?
34250,PS2,3,770.28,773.88,3.6,2.0,So why do you what do you mean by encryption can be safeguarded?
34250,PS2,3,773.88,775.04,1.16,2.0,Isn't the encryption?
34250,PS2,3,775.04,780.68,5.64,1.0,"Does no, because everybody is like for example, now I tell you that one equals to AB equals to 2 equals to B, right?"
34250,PS2,3,780.76,782.44,1.68,1.0,"If I give you like 123, you know it's ABC."
34250,PS2,3,782.64,787.4,4.76,2.0,You know that code encryption can save that by creating a secret code.
34250,PS2,3,788.8,789.36,0.56,1.0,Creating.
34250,PS2,3,792.6,793.96,1.36,2.0,I don't know what you're trying to say.
34250,PS2,3,794.0,797.96,3.96,1.0,"OK, so, OK, what I'm trying to say is this so like, you know, right now hackers, right?"
34250,PS2,3,797.96,802.56,4.6,1.0,"They, they look for like, so usually there'll be, let's say image a image B, right?"
34250,PS2,3,802.56,803.96,1.4,1.0,So A is traced to one.
34250,PS2,3,803.96,807.4,3.44,1.0,"Remember we did the thing as a trace to 1B, trace to 2C, trace to C, right?"
34250,PS2,3,807.92,808.44,0.52,1.0,"Three, right."
34250,PS2,3,808.44,810.92,2.48,1.0,"So now if I tell, if you know an e-mail, I don't really know my code."
34250,PS2,3,810.92,812.52,1.6,1.0,SO123 stands for ABC.
34250,PS2,3,812.52,816.84,4.32,1.0,"So you know, I'm telling Vanessa ABC, I tell Vanessa 123, you know, I'm actually telling for ABC."
34250,PS2,3,817.28,820.36,3.08,1.0,"You get what I'm trying to say because you know the answer, you can trace."
34250,PS2,3,820.92,821.76,0.84,1.0,"Yeah, Yeah."
34250,PS2,3,822.16,824.48,2.32,1.0,"But what is happening right now, they use lava lamps."
34250,PS2,3,824.48,828.44,3.96,1.0,So they take a camera to to basically take care because lava lamp is completely random.
34250,PS2,3,828.44,832.44,4.0,1.0,"So every single millisecond is different the code, so it's impossible to check."
34250,PS2,3,833.0,835.52,2.52,1.0,So now we can use animals like animals like.
34250,PS2,3,836.0,839.84,3.84,3.0,"So we tried the the cat, for example, and every time it goes to the toilet."
34250,PS2,3,842.36,842.76,0.4,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34250,PS2,3,852.92,856.28,3.36,1.0,"Creating encryptions will be OK, will be OK."
34250,PS2,3,856.36,857.92,1.56,2.0,What encryption means?
34250,PS2,3,858.2,864.16,5.96,1.0,The ream of encryptions of somebody.
34250,PS2,3,864.16,870.84,6.68,1.0,The encryption of somebody that would be modded after the monetary needs after the after the of.
34250,PS2,3,873.72,875.28,1.56,2.0,The number of times.
34250,PS2,3,875.48,884.36,8.88,1.0,"Of the number of times of times of a number of times what, 55 randomly selected cats?"
34250,PS2,3,884.36,884.52,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
34250,PS2,3,885.28,885.6,0.32,3.0,5
34250,PS2,3,886.44,894.76,8.32,1.0,"Let's do 5 or maybe more, more than that 25, maybe that's like 35 randomly like that domestic cats."
34250,PS2,3,895.64,896.6,0.96,1.0,Domestic cat.
34250,PS2,3,897.12,897.68,0.56,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
34250,PS2,3,897.68,902.72,5.04,1.0,"In the relative encryption or server data, we model, model, model, model, model, model."
34250,PS2,3,905.4,913.24,7.84,1.0,"Is it one one hour, 2 hour model after the number of times 35 randomly selected domestic cats?"
34250,PS2,3,914.28,916.08,1.8,2.0,Go to the toilet.
34250,PS2,3,916.12,921.68,5.56,1.0,Go to the order food or go to the toilet plus eat food.
34250,PS2,3,921.68,921.76,0.08,1.0,Eat.
34250,PS2,3,921.96,922.4,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, let's."
34250,PS2,3,923.08,923.2,0.12,3.0,Say.
34250,PS2,3,924.48,925.96,1.48,1.0,And consume food.
34250,PS2,3,927.88,933.16,5.28,1.0,Consume food in 4 hour.
34250,PS2,3,934.48,934.88,0.4,3.0,For that.
34250,PS2,3,935.2,936.0,0.8,1.0,4 hour.
34250,PS2,3,937.32,937.72,0.4,3.0,"OK, that's good."
34250,PS2,3,937.76,940.52,2.76,3.0,How's it going?
34250,PS2,3,940.92,941.24,0.32,3.0,"Yeah, today."
34250,PS2,3,943.12,943.56,0.44,1.0,So far.
36291,PS4,3,3.04,8.88,5.84,1.0,"Inequalities, unequal distribution of academic resources to disadvantage."
36291,PS4,3,9.28,10.88,1.6,1.0,Please come up with one treated idea.
36291,PS4,3,12.76,13.32,0.56,1.0,"Oh my God, this."
36291,PS4,3,13.32,15.32,2.0,1.0,"See, this feels like my thesis right now."
36291,PS4,3,15.32,16.6,1.28,1.0,This is what I'm working on.
36291,PS4,3,18.92,20.96,2.04,1.0,But this is exactly what I'm working on.
36291,PS4,3,20.96,26.48,5.52,1.0,"Except like, from a language perspective, well, do."
36291,PS4,3,26.72,27.6,0.88,2.0,You have any established?
36291,PS4,3,28.28,37.48,9.2,1.0,Idea of any creative ideas to overcome inequality like there are many except like politics does not let them be creative and and like I think we.
36291,PS4,3,37.48,40.4,2.92,1.0,What we should come up with is how to make politics creative.
36291,PS4,3,43.08,44.72,1.64,1.0,"Actually, let's just write that."
36291,PS4,3,44.72,48.52,3.8,1.0,"Make politics creative, make educational politics creative."
36291,PS4,3,52.16,56.84,4.68,1.0,But I don't even know if that counts as a creative idea.
36291,PS4,3,62.08,76.08,14.0,1.0,"But right now, currently, I think it's more to do with the quality of education that gets affected because of the unequal distribution of academic resources."
36291,PS4,3,76.68,83.24,6.56,1.0,And that actually also depends a lot on just English being the main language of instruction almost everywhere.
36291,PS4,3,83.24,88.36,5.12,1.0,And not everybody's language of instruction imagines their mother tongue or their native language.
36291,PS4,3,88.76,105.96,17.2,1.0,"So that causes trouble because I feel like it's not the distribution of academic resources, but the way it's looked at that kind of like becomes a problem because having English as a standard medium of instruction makes the inequality."
36291,PS4,3,107.44,107.92,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
36291,PS4,3,109.08,120.84,11.76,1.0,"But alternatively, you also don't have any other ways of like thinking about how would you then do global education Like then how will we be here speaking to each other if you're going to like promote any alternatives?"
36291,PS4,3,120.88,125.76,4.88,2.0,So like maybe would like tragedy and stuff you can like translate different resources into.
36291,PS4,3,125.88,127.04,1.16,1.0,A How about we have?
36291,PS4,3,127.52,142.6,15.08,1.0,"How about we have like translators in in like an ear device which like even though you speak in like a different language, it just automatically translated translates it for you to your native tongue but."
36291,PS4,3,143.48,145.96,2.48,2.0,Some of you like the language program is more for like.
36291,PS4,3,146.08,147.96,1.88,1.0,The academic resources.
36291,PS4,3,148.16,153.6,5.44,2.0,"I don't have access to resources overseas, but for like the most group maybe they don't even have the resource."
36291,PS4,3,153.64,156.76,3.12,1.0,"In China, like even technology is not very accessible."
36291,PS4,3,157.28,159.12,1.84,1.0,Even in Hindi technology is not accessible.
36291,PS4,3,159.92,178.96,19.04,1.0,Maybe making technology use more accessible that would that would affect that would affect how how education can become equal because if even if you can just have like a device or like anything you can have access to like resources.
36291,PS4,3,179.72,185.48,5.76,2.0,"Yeah, maybe like kind of educate people how to make use of the resources they have to get the most out of it."
36291,PS4,3,186.4,193.24,6.84,3.0,So I think we can encourage more university to upload more public courses online and this.
36291,PS4,3,193.24,193.76,0.52,2.0,Course can.
36291,PS4,3,193.8,195.84,2.04,3.0,Be real by different groups.
36291,PS4,3,196.52,197.12,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS4,3,197.12,205.56,8.44,1.0,"And if that is what I meant, like couple that with the device itself, because like not everybody has devices itself."
36291,PS4,3,205.76,208.96,3.2,1.0,"So even if you do make it online, how would they access it?"
36291,PS4,3,209.36,228.76,19.4,1.0,So maybe making technological devices available with online resources that can be accessed?
36291,PS4,3,235.92,237.32,1.4,1.0,What am I missing?
36291,PS4,3,237.68,247.44,9.76,1.0,"Technological resources available with online, Online content, educational content."
36291,PS4,3,247.44,250.16,2.72,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
36291,PS4,3,250.76,257.16,6.4,3.0,And I also have one idea and I think that it's the government duty that likes the school.
36291,PS4,3,257.16,271.96,14.8,3.0,"Each school has a certain proportion of groups and maybe, maybe in in the 110% of Chinese or 10% of India and 50%."
36291,PS4,3,271.96,272.48,0.52,1.0,More diverse?
36291,PS4,3,272.48,273.16,0.68,1.0,"Yes, diverse."
36291,PS4,3,273.8,274.16,0.36,3.0,OK.
36291,PS4,3,274.16,279.8,5.64,3.0,And it's it's it's a common policy that between different.
36291,PS4,3,280.48,290.8,10.32,1.0,"Schools, OK, Yeah, actually that makes sense because that would actually promote inclusivity and that itself would kind of standardise the inequalities."
36291,PS4,3,291.4,297.2,5.8,1.0,"So making classrooms more diverse or schools more diverse, I think."
36291,PS4,3,297.28,298.88,1.6,3.0,It's a it's a policy.
36291,PS4,3,299.48,300.36,0.88,1.0,"Actually, we should do."
36291,PS4,3,300.52,303.4,2.88,1.0,"Making school management more diverse, yeah."
36291,PS4,3,303.76,310.44,6.68,1.0,"Because if that's where you are, then like they'll automatically make sure that everybody else is provided for."
36291,PS4,3,310.52,313.24,2.72,2.0,Another problem is like there are good schools and bad school.
36291,PS4,3,313.44,318.92,5.48,2.0,"Like if there's education, free education, everyone gets to go to 1 school but maybe the best schools I'll go to like."
36291,PS4,3,319.16,320.24,1.08,1.0,Exactly.
36291,PS4,3,320.4,320.8,0.4,2.0,So maybe.
36291,PS4,3,320.8,326.52,5.72,1.0,Like so administration more more diverse in terms of ethnicity class.
36291,PS4,3,327.16,332.72,5.56,2.0,Or maybe like make the rotation of like teachers and like teaching resources like rotate between different schools.
36291,PS4,3,332.72,338.12,5.4,2.0,So you can't really tell which school is good or bad because one year like this results will be in the school and.
36291,PS4,3,338.48,343.24,4.76,1.0,"That yeah, I think that would work more for the admin, but not for teachers exactly."
36291,PS4,3,343.24,351.8,8.56,1.0,Because if you're rotating teachers around schools then the the bond with the children won't work and the children will then lose interest in learning.
36291,PS4,3,352.64,353.76,1.12,2.0,You mean like not?
36291,PS4,3,354.52,357.32,2.8,1.0,Like if for example my teacher is changing and rotating.
36291,PS4,3,357.48,360.6,3.12,2.0,"Oh I mean not for like very frequent, like maybe for one year, 2 year."
36291,PS4,3,361.24,366.12,4.88,1.0,"Still like actually that's good, but at the same time like."
36291,PS4,3,366.88,367.24,0.36,2.0,Or maybe.
36291,PS4,3,367.24,376.16,8.92,1.0,For you won't have that kind of stability in the relationship where a child might feel safe enough to actually be motivated to come to school or learn.
36291,PS4,3,376.16,382.16,6.0,1.0,"So that that would actually impact more of the emotional dynamic bonding formation, which impacts learning."
36291,PS4,3,382.16,382.28,0.12,1.0,OK.
36291,PS4,3,383.44,401.48,18.04,1.0,"So, but this idea would work if we refocus it to the board members because that way you don't have like any profit making incentives that will stay like then if you're rotating it across schools with the board members and admin, they're not the ones who directly deal with children."
36291,PS4,3,401.64,404.6,2.96,1.0,"So that can be something that, yeah, we can do that."
36291,PS4,3,404.76,405.2,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, I guess."
36291,PS4,3,405.24,410.76,5.52,2.0,"I know there's a course because like in my local, there's some good school in that school and people are trying to get to the good schools."
36291,PS4,3,411.04,418.48,7.44,2.0,"And then what they do is they merge every single school, yeah, and say like, oh, this teacher might end up in like whatever one of the school."
36291,PS4,3,419.24,421.2,1.96,2.0,So you can't really tell which one is good or bad.
36291,PS4,3,421.2,424.12,2.92,2.0,So there's like this inequality in like which school?
36291,PS4,3,424.12,424.6,0.48,1.0,To go to.
36291,PS4,3,424.64,426.92,2.28,1.0,Does that work for the children like?
36291,PS4,3,427.4,431.4,4.0,2.0,"It's not like for maybe like for one year, two or three years, not very like."
36291,PS4,3,431.4,431.88,0.48,1.0,Frequent.
36291,PS4,3,431.88,432.92,1.04,1.0,Is this like practice?
36291,PS4,3,432.92,434.56,1.64,1.0,Like have you seen this?
36291,PS4,3,434.56,434.96,0.4,2.0,Happen.
36291,PS4,3,435.04,436.6,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, so, so how?"
36291,PS4,3,437.36,443.16,5.8,1.0,"I'm sorry I'm just like digressing here, but like, do children also like like that practice or it's not?"
36291,PS4,3,444.2,448.12,3.92,2.0,"It's not that micro founded, it's more like in the school management level."
36291,PS4,3,448.16,450.36,2.2,2.0,You won't concentrate the good teachers within one.
36291,PS4,3,450.68,451.0,0.32,1.0,OK.
36291,PS4,3,451.08,451.32,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS4,3,451.36,452.4,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, that makes sense."
36291,PS4,3,452.48,455.16,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, having a rotational system."
36291,PS4,3,456.08,456.76,0.68,2.0,I wouldn't say that's.
36291,PS4,3,458.2,458.64,0.44,1.0,Very creative.
36291,PS4,3,458.64,458.8,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS4,3,458.8,460.08,1.28,1.0,This is like very practical.
36291,PS4,3,460.08,463.68,3.6,1.0,"We're not thinking creatively, but like having a rotational system for."
36291,PS4,3,466.0,471.08,5.08,1.0,But then the inherent problem with that becomes is that then why do you just have these few good teachers?
36291,PS4,3,471.08,472.32,1.24,1.0,Why are not all teachers good?
36291,PS4,3,472.44,473.64,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, and also."
36291,PS4,3,473.68,478.36,4.68,1.0,Then then it kind of like stuns the because then you see the unequal distribution.
36291,PS4,3,479.32,524.76,45.44,1.0,"So yeah, having a rotational system for for education, education, what positions would I say education leaders across different institutions, different school institutions in order to maintain equity or something I."
36291,PS4,3,524.84,525.28,0.44,2.0,Don't know.
36291,PS4,3,525.28,525.88,0.6,2.0,Never mind.
36291,PS4,3,525.92,527.12,1.2,2.0,I don't think we're for.
36291,PS4,3,527.12,530.28,3.16,1.0,"Education, yeah, I think, OK, what do we want to go with?"
36291,PS4,3,532.08,567.2,35.12,1.0,"I'm really for educational leaders across different schools, but I really like this idea across different school to move around the country on a yearly basis in order to promote overall equality in the quality of education."
36291,PS4,3,567.24,567.36,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36291,PS4,3,567.96,569.08,1.12,2.0,Equally in the distribution.
36291,PS4,3,573.24,573.72,0.48,1.0,OK.
36291,PS4,3,575.72,577.28,1.56,2.0,I think so far I'd.
36291,PS4,3,578.08,578.68,0.6,1.0,Like to.
36291,PS4,3,580.08,580.44,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
36291,PS4,3,580.44,583.44,3.0,2.0,But I would say like maybe I could come up with that also.
36291,PS4,3,584.0,592.0,8.0,1.0,"Yeah, I think a three and four, The 4th 1 looks very promising to me, honestly, like having a relational system for diverse education."
36291,PS4,3,592.0,593.52,1.52,1.0,Let's combine two and three.
36291,PS4,3,595.4,597.16,1.76,1.0,"OK, ideas three and four."
36291,PS4,3,598.08,610.32,12.24,1.0,Final ideas 3 and 4 have you just get a copy paste.
36291,PS4,3,617.08,618.52,1.44,1.0,Oh shit what did I do?
36291,PS4,3,622.44,626.64,4.2,1.0,I'm I'm used to the the Mac.
36291,PS4,3,627.32,656.4,29.08,1.0,"It's like, OK, having a tradition for for diverse education leaders to move around the country on an yearly basis across multiple institutes in order to promote overall equality in the quality."
36291,PS4,3,657.84,664.48,6.64,1.0,"Yeah, I mean, this does not, it's no creative language, but this is a creative idea."
36291,PS4,3,665.08,666.76,1.68,1.0,Do you think should we go for that?
36291,PS4,3,668.0,668.32,0.32,1.0,OK.
35399,PS6,3,0.08,1.28,1.2,1.0,Is a bit easier I guess.
35399,PS6,3,1.48,2.12,0.64,2.0,Really I.
35399,PS6,3,2.36,3.2,0.84,1.0,"Mean we did, maybe."
35399,PS6,3,3.32,5.6,2.28,2.0,But they're just with more people.
35399,PS6,3,5.6,6.52,0.92,2.0,You have like more ideas.
35399,PS6,3,6.52,7.48,0.96,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35399,PS6,3,7.48,9.24,1.76,3.0,We need to decide the best.
35399,PS6,3,9.4,9.56,0.16,2.0,1
35399,PS6,3,20.55,21.03,0.48,1.0,In the.
35399,PS6,3,27.27,39.28,12.01,3.0,Shower maybe you can like just record your singing and send to some platform or the research group and you will earn some bonus something like that.
35399,PS6,3,39.92,47.64,7.72,3.0,"So it's just if you have the audio, you will have the voice of water and the and your singing yeah."
35399,PS6,3,47.64,54.56,6.92,3.0,So you if you have the both at the same time and then maybe you get some like payment for.
35399,PS6,3,55.68,57.64,1.96,1.0,You'll have more Tik Toks in the shower.
35399,PS6,3,59.04,63.96,4.92,2.0,"I, I thought about that here I can play like some influencers to, to do the videos I'm singing."
35399,PS6,3,64.2,68.72,4.52,2.0,"I also thought maybe it would be, I'm not sure how that would work, but maybe it would be beneficial."
35399,PS6,3,68.72,71.72,3.0,2.0,Like more people are doing that like in the same time.
35399,PS6,3,71.72,83.64,11.92,2.0,"So for example, if you have like a swimming pool and then people just get well into the shower, like you can have like a pool like karaoke."
35399,PS6,3,84.12,84.56,0.44,1.0,Events.
35399,PS6,3,84.68,85.48,0.8,2.0,Or things like that.
35399,PS6,3,85.76,86.0,0.24,1.0,OK.
35399,PS6,3,87.0,88.32,1.32,2.0,But like choirs in the pool.
35399,PS6,3,88.48,91.12,2.64,3.0,"But the point is like, it's good for health."
35399,PS6,3,91.12,97.64,6.52,3.0,"So we, we need them to like realise this behaviour is good for health, right?"
35399,PS6,3,98.12,99.08,0.96,3.0,Not just for you.
35399,PS6,3,99.08,100.88,1.8,2.0,Need like to put people to be aware.
35399,PS6,3,100.88,104.52,3.64,2.0,"You just want them to encourage, to encourage people."
35399,PS6,3,104.52,107.12,2.6,3.0,"To shop, staying there, OK."
35399,PS6,3,108.4,116.76,8.36,1.0,"I was, I was going to say to make like water bills free so that you can shower as long as you want, but that doesn't encourage people to to sing."
35399,PS6,3,117.0,122.6,5.6,1.0,"I like, I like your idea about like, I mean, I don't know how it'll be, but."
35399,PS6,3,122.96,127.08,4.12,2.0,"But we need to make it fat into fat, Yeah."
35399,PS6,3,127.12,127.24,0.12,2.0,So.
35399,PS6,3,127.24,129.64,2.4,1.0,"People are just, but that would be it."
35399,PS6,3,129.72,137.08,7.36,1.0,"Imagine like going to, I don't know what colleges you're from, you're not going to like King's College and everybody showering together."
35399,PS6,3,137.24,137.84,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35399,PS6,3,139.8,143.8,4.0,3.0,"So it can say like, organise and."
35399,PS6,3,144.4,149.68,5.28,2.0,Event then group showering and singing at the same time like type or like.
35399,PS6,3,150.2,154.12,3.92,3.0,"Fire like, like just music festivals."
35399,PS6,3,154.28,155.08,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35399,PS6,3,155.28,160.44,5.16,2.0,You can give like more information not only music festival.
35399,PS6,3,163.68,164.96,1.28,3.0,"Karaoke, Yeah."
35399,PS6,3,166.88,167.2,0.32,2.0,How to?
35399,PS6,3,167.24,167.96,0.72,1.0,Spell karaoke.
35399,PS6,3,167.96,168.48,0.52,1.0,"Yeah, it's correct."

35399,PS6,3,174.04,176.0,1.96,1.0,"OK, anything but anyone."
35399,PS6,3,176.72,177.8,1.08,1.0,I do feel like this.
35399,PS6,3,177.96,180.84,2.88,1.0,"I know we're digressing a bit, but I do feel like a smaller group."
35399,PS6,3,180.84,184.96,4.12,1.0,"Sorry, I mean, we're engaging you as well, but I do feel like a smaller group."
35399,PS6,3,184.96,191.72,6.76,1.0,We generate lesser ideas and they come to consensus a lot faster.
35399,PS6,3,193.16,208.6,15.44,1.0,"But OK, wait, let me take encourage or or or to or to to draw on your idea earlier."
35399,PS6,3,208.92,211.92,3.0,1.0,What if we had like a?
35399,PS6,3,215.72,222.48,6.76,1.0,"It's not really a platform, but like the government, because I'm just seeing this like it's more of a public health thing."
35399,PS6,3,222.88,231.6,8.72,1.0,"So in every shower, in every home, we install like a not so much a recording, but like, like a microphone as you shower."
35399,PS6,3,232.0,235.52,3.52,1.0,"And so like, you can see like how long you've been singing for."
35399,PS6,3,235.56,239.12,3.56,1.0,"And after 20 minutes, then the bar, yeah, like a bar."
35399,PS6,3,239.12,244.76,5.64,1.0,"And then you get like some like 10 lbs into your, you know what I'm like."
35399,PS6,3,244.76,247.72,2.96,1.0,At least it has to be a decent.
35399,PS6,3,247.76,252.0,4.24,1.0,"If you say like 1 LB, maybe people don't want to do it, but maybe it's like 10 lbs."
35399,PS6,3,252.04,255.64,3.6,1.0,You can get like a a good meal for £10.
35399,PS6,3,255.64,262.4,6.76,1.0,"So then even if I don't want to do it, I will gladly sing for £10."
35399,PS6,3,262.64,263.24,0.6,1.0,You know what?
35399,PS6,3,263.24,263.32,0.08,1.0,I.
35399,PS6,3,263.64,264.08,0.44,2.0,Mean.
35399,PS6,3,264.56,264.84,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35399,PS6,3,266.2,268.44,2.24,2.0,But kindly also like not only like monetary.
35399,PS6,3,268.44,276.16,7.72,2.0,You can for example have like be first in the queue for like some surgery procedure or something like if if it's like.
35399,PS6,3,276.28,286.44,10.16,1.0,"Coming for like some tokens and then with the tokens you can sell the tokens or like, yeah, I mean, just another idea that I thought of."
35399,PS6,3,287.64,293.12,5.48,3.0,"Yeah, I think money is the best, isn't it, for them to do that right?"
35399,PS6,3,293.92,300.4,6.48,2.0,"Yeah, but I also like think as as with the first, you don't have to like only give like one specific answer."
35399,PS6,3,300.4,308.4,8.0,2.0,"You can give some like, well, yeah, but like it can be like money or something."
35399,PS6,3,308.4,312.08,3.68,2.0,"Like for example, he will pay it with money or Amazon vouchers."
35399,PS6,3,312.44,313.24,0.8,2.0,"It's fine, right?"
35399,PS6,3,313.24,313.64,0.4,3.0,So.
35399,PS6,3,314.2,316.12,1.92,2.0,"With that could be the same, right?"
35399,PS6,3,316.12,317.88,1.76,2.0,So you can exchange it like you have.
35399,PS6,3,317.88,321.68,3.8,2.0,You're giving the tokens and you can do with them as you please.
35399,PS6,3,321.76,325.0,3.24,1.0,"OK, so I mean, that's just another idea."
35399,PS6,3,325.52,326.4,0.88,1.0,Do you want to change it?
35399,PS6,3,326.4,328.0,1.6,1.0,I'm OK to not change it.
35399,PS6,3,331.0,332.4,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, I'm good with it."
35399,PS6,3,332.4,333.16,0.76,3.0,Or if you.
35399,PS6,3,333.16,333.32,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35399,PS6,3,333.32,333.92,0.6,2.0,"So, OK."
35399,PS6,3,333.92,335.68,1.76,2.0,So we can then explore this one.
35399,PS6,3,335.68,336.16,0.48,2.0,"OK, so."
35399,PS6,3,363.8,366.68,2.88,1.0,Like that I would love to go for a music festival everyday.
35399,PS6,3,370.12,372.64,2.52,2.0,Also maybe like those events can be free as well.
35399,PS6,3,372.84,400.52,27.68,3.0,Or maybe like we can emphasize this is like healthy music festival and everyone want to like maybe wear some like swimming suit and then they shower together and they will record their singing and then everyone can hear all of all of the people singing.
35399,PS6,3,400.84,405.72,4.88,3.0,"And then they will like, we will like design A poll."
35399,PS6,3,405.88,408.32,2.44,3.0,So which one do you think is the best?
35399,PS6,3,408.36,409.88,1.52,3.0,And the best one will get some.
35399,PS6,3,410.12,410.32,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35399,PS6,3,410.32,412.76,2.44,2.0,But I'm not sure if everyone will be on board with that.
35399,PS6,3,412.96,415.16,2.2,2.0,There are some people that don't want to be recorded.
35399,PS6,3,415.32,422.12,6.8,2.0,"Also, there are some people that would not like to be in a bathing suit probably or like very like would prefer to be more modest."
35399,PS6,3,422.48,425.64,3.16,2.0,So you'll be discouraging some of the people and you want to do it.
35399,PS6,3,426.12,427.56,1.44,2.0,Make it as common as you can.
35399,PS6,3,427.68,433.4,5.72,1.0,"Now that you said this, I'm just thinking how would be, I mean, I'm sorry, I'm just giving an example."
35399,PS6,3,433.4,435.32,1.92,1.0,"Imagine all of us, like three of us."
35399,PS6,3,435.32,436.88,1.56,1.0,I didn't go to this music fest.
35399,PS6,3,436.96,437.96,1.0,1.0,How do we shower?
35399,PS6,3,439.44,446.08,6.64,2.0,So my idea would be like you have a like some tent and you have like sprinklers maybe like everybody.
35399,PS6,3,446.08,450.0,3.92,1.0,"Has their own cubicle, but then you're singing together, no?"
35399,PS6,3,450.12,454.12,4.0,2.0,"Maybe, maybe, but also you can just like everyone just is in the same room."
35399,PS6,3,454.12,459.76,5.64,2.0,Maybe just like like I sporty clothes and just like some sprinkles.
35399,PS6,3,459.76,463.64,3.88,1.0,"You know if you're wearing clothes, you can't stop water, right?"
35399,PS6,3,464.88,465.64,0.76,1.0,You know what I mean?
35399,PS6,3,466.16,467.36,1.2,2.0,It's like depends on what?
35399,PS6,3,467.36,469.4,2.04,2.0,What is your understanding of showering?
35399,PS6,3,470.72,473.08,2.36,1.0,"I mean, I only have one idea of showering."
35399,PS6,3,474.2,477.2,3.0,1.0,I don't know what other ideas are showering.
35399,PS6,3,477.2,478.76,1.56,3.0,To say it's a private right.

35399,PS6,3,479.08,479.24,0.16,1.0,Quite.
35399,PS6,3,479.32,480.36,1.04,1.0,It's quite a private thing.
35399,PS6,3,480.36,484.32,3.96,1.0,"So I mean, initially I like the idea of going to music, but."
35399,PS6,3,484.32,490.12,5.8,2.0,"Then in when you're in the folder, like a lot of shower cabins next to each other, right?"

35399,PS6,3,510.68,511.56,0.88,2.0,"So strange, yeah."
35399,PS6,3,512.04,513.76,1.72,3.0,We can write everyone.
35399,PS6,3,515.6,525.92,10.32,3.0,Everyone has space in their own space.

35401,PS4,3,36.0,38.44,2.44,1.0,This is actually something that happened in my home country.
35401,PS4,3,38.8,48.6,9.8,1.0,"So there's like a Indonesia, so there's like a, even though we live in the same city, there's a certain area that people are more wealthy and other one is less the full of."
35401,PS4,3,49.04,56.44,7.4,1.0,And one thing that the people the government did is like making old school equal.
35401,PS4,3,56.44,62.16,5.72,1.0,Like there's no such thing as a private school teacher and also non private school teacher.
35401,PS4,3,62.16,68.16,6.0,1.0,"And then there's also a thing like a favorite school where a really, really smart student can only get it."
35401,PS4,3,68.6,81.6,13.0,1.0,"And it was like that, but the government changed for it to be like a zonation so that people that live near to that school can go to that school instead of people that are smart from another part of the city coming on."
35401,PS4,3,81.72,82.68,0.96,2.0,"Yeah, it depends on where you."

35401,PS4,3,89.04,105.08,16.04,1.0,"Like equal yeah, because the amount of teachers also no such a thing as like a private or and then also come up with a zonation because before it's like smart student go to this school student yeah."
35401,PS4,3,105.44,129.0,23.56,3.0,"I was thinking like maybe having like Tambola and like you have like different like amounts of money and different places and then you just like assign them randomly rather than just saying, oh, this is the best part of the country or the world."
35401,PS4,3,129.0,135.96,6.96,3.0,And then they get more resources that they could be like more distributed.
35401,PS4,3,136.44,137.88,1.44,3.0,And obviously that's a good.
35401,PS4,3,139.56,143.88,4.32,1.0,"But I think that that the case, the teacher needs to be like a civil worker."
35401,PS4,3,144.16,145.64,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35401,PS4,3,147.68,162.44,14.76,2.0,But this tricky this question is tricky because sometimes people doesn't access the location because they need to fulfill most like basic needs first.

35401,PS4,3,230.6,231.28,0.68,1.0,Invest.
35401,PS4,3,231.44,231.96,0.52,2.0,In what?

35401,PS4,3,233.76,235.12,1.36,2.0,But that's very broad as well.
35401,PS4,3,236.44,238.52,2.08,1.0,Let's give the context first also.
35401,PS4,3,239.36,241.28,1.92,3.0,"Yeah, we can say like cotton ring."

35401,PS4,3,277.44,282.4,4.96,3.0,Disadvantaged and marginalised groups get like.
35401,PS4,3,282.52,303.0,20.48,3.0,"If we have 100% of like resources, then like this groups get more like 70% of the resources and we distribute it like that and then the not marginalised groups get less consuming that they already have more so that, but that's not."
35401,PS4,3,304.96,306.44,1.48,1.0,"I think in this case we're talking, yeah."
35401,PS4,3,306.6,308.28,1.68,2.0,Something like that.
35401,PS4,3,309.64,313.88,4.24,1.0,"And also this case is talking about the resource, academic resources, like the teacher and stuff, right?"

36283,PS2,6,36.56,36.88,0.32,3.0,This is.
36283,PS2,6,37.12,42.8,5.68,4.0,"Vulnerability with supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules, like for example."
36283,PS2,6,42.8,43.08,0.28,3.0,There is.
36283,PS2,6,43.08,44.48,1.4,3.0,So what kind of bone company?
36283,PS2,6,44.92,60.44,15.52,4.0,"That is developing a drug and the company is based in the US and they are importing from India, let's say, what some of their materials that they use for creating this very sophisticated drug, OK?"
36283,PS2,6,63.0,69.04,6.04,4.0,"And this is a supply chain that might be disrupted for various reasons, OK."
36283,PS2,6,70.88,72.08,1.2,3.0,I guess a natural disaster.
36283,PS2,6,72.08,74.28,2.2,4.0,Natural disaster trade.
36283,PS2,6,74.96,75.48,0.52,1.0,Wars.
36283,PS2,6,75.6,94.52,18.92,4.0,"Or conflicts, which means that it it kind of delays the production of the of the medication, the pharma company will have a smaller batch, the demand will be higher, the smaller the pharma company would like to compensate for the losses."
36283,PS2,6,94.52,96.2,1.68,4.0,So it will raise the budget of the drug.
36283,PS2,6,96.2,96.68,0.48,4.0,Got it.
36283,PS2,6,97.88,99.16,1.28,1.0,So we're trying to tackle that.
36283,PS2,6,99.48,99.72,0.24,4.0,Issue.
36283,PS2,6,99.76,104.24,4.48,4.0,"So we're trying, yes, to find a methodology that would."
36283,PS2,6,105.0,105.44,0.44,1.0,Make it.
36283,PS2,6,105.44,108.92,3.48,4.0,"Limit the you know, make this more of a secure."
36283,PS2,6,109.32,109.88,0.56,1.0,Not necessarily.
36283,PS2,6,110.28,110.36,0.08,4.0,The.
36283,PS2,6,110.72,111.32,0.6,3.0,"More, more."
36283,PS2,6,112.16,114.12,1.96,4.0,Retail or like retail like.
36283,PS2,6,115.12,120.08,4.96,1.0,Basically supplying the manufacturing products and how would that be made secure?
36283,PS2,6,120.52,130.88,10.36,4.0,Like not one of the issues would be to to to globalize or like spread in different countries the various stakeholders in the supply chain.
36283,PS2,6,130.88,133.2,2.32,4.0,So if there is some disruption.
36283,PS2,6,133.2,134.0,0.8,3.0,You can just go somewhere.
36283,PS2,6,134.04,135.0,0.96,4.0,"Else, yeah, you can."
36283,PS2,6,135.4,137.28,1.88,4.0,"You can, you know, create a network."
36283,PS2,6,139.4,140.24,0.84,1.0,That is a good idea.
36283,PS2,6,141.2,141.4,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36283,PS2,6,141.4,151.0,9.6,2.0,But the question is to tackle tackle supply means in general.
36283,PS2,6,151.08,163.52,12.44,2.0,"In general, we need to make some kind of global monitoring system with not like another QR code, but to put every single, let's say, detail with the QR code is quite, let's say, difficult."
36283,PS2,6,163.52,177.36,13.84,2.0,"But to make a kind of, I know, molecular or some kind of chemistry element dedicated for like a marker which might be scanned by some special equipment like, you know, a radio."
36283,PS2,6,179.48,183.48,4.0,2.0,"We have NFC, but NFC is a physical thing."
36283,PS2,6,184.04,200.88,16.84,2.0,"But we can do something chemical or like, you know, nanotechnology, some kind of nano sign which might be scanned globally for every single product and make make a codification."
36283,PS2,6,201.16,225.08,23.92,2.0,"Like, you know, you have a database of all the products registered to this database and have the some kind of, I mean, marker on the yeah, on, on, on the product to track and tackle all over the world globally depends on not even the the I'm talking about the the chain supply chain."
36283,PS2,6,225.2,231.2,6.0,2.0,"Well, it's, it's more than supply chain because it's it, it can track every single product."
36283,PS2,6,231.2,243.28,12.08,2.0,"Not, not, not, let's say a chain of yeah, like a barcode, but in global, a global barcode, not exactly barcode."
36283,PS2,6,245.48,247.08,1.6,1.0,So how does that help this?
36283,PS2,6,247.88,249.56,1.68,3.0,'Cause that is more like identify like.
36283,PS2,6,250.2,253.4,3.2,2.0,"You can, you can, you can, you can track a physical movements."
36283,PS2,6,253.4,259.0,5.6,2.0,"For example, if you if you have a rocking chain because of you know so then you can OK you."
36283,PS2,6,259.48,259.92,0.44,1.0,Can make sure.
36283,PS2,6,259.92,268.48,8.56,2.0,This must have been blocked by by the sheep stands there and you need to and you physically see on the map all this Let's see.
36283,PS2,6,269.96,274.68,4.72,1.0,So we're just ensuring that there is no case where it goes like.
36283,PS2,6,275.44,277.16,1.72,3.0,We don't know where it is like we know where it is.
36283,PS2,6,277.24,278.2,0.96,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, OK, makes."
36283,PS2,6,278.28,279.16,0.88,5.0,Sense so it helps we need.
36283,PS2,6,279.16,283.0,3.84,1.0,"To see the time, we don't see the time."
36283,PS2,6,283.2,284.08,0.88,3.0,"Oh, sorry."
36283,PS2,6,285.16,285.36,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36283,PS2,6,285.36,292.08,6.72,3.0,"So, so OK, well, what if we can like some kind have some kind of forecast or like some kind of early warning system with AI?"
36283,PS2,6,293.56,296.92,3.36,4.0,"Like a predictive, we can do like like a predictive."
36283,PS2,6,297.64,297.84,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
36283,PS2,6,298.76,300.88,2.12,4.0,Prognostic prognostic software.
36283,PS2,6,300.88,314.72,13.84,4.0,"I have a friend who's doing quantum physics, quantum computing and he's actually started a start up about how to, yeah, improve optimise trade specific of no idea what it is."
36283,PS2,6,314.72,318.0,3.28,4.0,"That's interesting and very yeah, it's very it's."
36283,PS2,6,319.2,320.4,1.2,2.0,Like a model of.
36283,PS2,6,320.92,327.96,7.04,4.0,"Yeah, prognostic model or a model of optimising trades and inter because."
36283,PS2,6,328.36,329.4,1.04,1.0,That's the world right now.
36283,PS2,6,329.88,331.6,1.72,1.0,"That's a very significant work, I think."
36283,PS2,6,332.96,333.16,0.2,3.0,I do.
36283,PS2,6,333.2,335.0,1.8,5.0,Like that I think we can make.
36283,PS2,6,335.0,344.24,9.24,6.0,"Some agreement global that's between different agents and if the agents break up break up with such agreement, they will get some punishments."
36283,PS2,6,345.36,346.04,0.68,3.0,Sanctions.
36283,PS2,6,348.6,378.88,30.28,2.0,Supplies does no and have no information enough information about logistic or what say or some kind of subcontractions who who may provide them something or say about some trade options on other countries whatsoever in the global system altogether with a with a combination of prognostic model and maybe some kind of codification of all the products.
36283,PS2,6,386.0,387.16,1.16,1.0,It's becoming more and more.
36283,PS2,6,387.64,391.8,4.16,1.0,I think we should just type at this question.
36283,PS2,6,391.8,392.76,0.96,1.0,It could be more creative.
36283,PS2,6,394.08,395.68,1.6,5.0,It's not a crazy question to begin with.
36283,PS2,6,396.52,397.28,0.76,3.0,This is.
36283,PS2,6,400.12,401.84,1.72,1.0,It's becoming more and more broad question.
36283,PS2,6,401.84,405.32,3.48,1.0,This question is not created I for our creativity.
36283,PS2,6,406.32,406.44,0.12,3.0,But.
36283,PS2,6,406.6,411.92,5.32,4.0,"I'd like to ask, I'd like to ask them to to share the report."
36283,PS2,6,413.32,413.68,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, both."
36283,PS2,6,414.08,417.2,3.12,2.0,Both reports with US results.
36283,PS2,6,418.16,419.32,1.16,1.0,So which one are we going for?
36283,PS2,6,419.4,420.2,0.8,5.0,If we have two sheets.
36283,PS2,6,421.2,424.4,3.2,1.0,Are we combining the tracking with the forecast I.
36283,PS2,6,424.8,425.08,0.28,5.0,Do like.
36283,PS2,6,425.64,428.56,2.92,1.0,"The forecast, so we could do tracking and forecast together."
36283,PS2,6,428.56,429.08,0.52,1.0,OK then.
36283,PS2,6,434.2,440.36,6.16,3.0,"So we first we let me see, so do we, is it at the same time or you kind of we kind of we just insert both."
36283,PS2,6,440.4,442.0,1.6,3.0,"It's not like a before and after really, it's just."
36283,PS2,6,442.0,442.84,0.84,1.0,It's not like the photograph.
36283,PS2,6,442.96,445.68,2.72,1.0,I think it's together like you're tracking and you're forecasting.
36283,PS2,6,445.72,447.72,2.0,5.0,"Yeah, and you can forecast based on the tracking."
36283,PS2,6,448.16,448.44,0.28,3.0,Position.
36283,PS2,6,448.44,449.04,0.6,3.0,"Yeah, that's true."
36283,PS2,6,449.88,453.64,3.76,2.0,It makes sense only if you have a global database in this case.
36283,PS2,6,453.68,457.72,4.04,1.0,"That is quite like doable, like a global database."
36283,PS2,6,458.0,460.4,2.4,1.0,I think is not a very impossible thing to do.
36283,PS2,6,461.32,461.96,0.64,2.0,Especially.
36283,PS2,6,462.44,473.52,11.08,1.0,"With supply chain, I think because it would be people who want to create that and like businesses would automatically profit knowing this kind of data, I think they would not create a lot."
36283,PS2,6,474.0,483.04,9.04,2.0,"Of trouble, you know, they will know markup which is a single step and the the everybody will as they competitive, competitive advantage because everybody should know."
36283,PS2,6,483.12,484.84,1.72,1.0,Everything just.
36283,PS2,6,484.84,486.72,1.88,2.0,Only one big global trader.
36283,PS2,6,488.0,490.12,2.12,1.0,"I mean, it does have its pitfalls, but."
36283,PS2,6,490.44,493.44,3.0,3.0,"So The thing is, we have to come with creative ideas, not as really practical ones."
36283,PS2,6,493.64,494.12,0.48,3.0,That's one thing.
36283,PS2,6,494.12,495.8,1.68,3.0,"Yeah, Like, oh, you know what?"
36283,PS2,6,495.8,496.48,0.68,3.0,What if we can't do?
36283,PS2,6,496.48,496.92,0.44,1.0,"Enough, I think."
36283,PS2,6,497.24,497.84,0.6,3.0,You think it's great?
36283,PS2,6,497.88,499.36,1.48,1.0,Enough we.
36283,PS2,6,499.36,500.16,0.8,3.0,Can move on.
35850,PS3,3,1.16,3.04,1.88,1.0,Imagine a new pandemic has emerged.
35850,PS3,3,3.76,5.64,1.88,2.0,"Oh no, this could not be good in England."
35850,PS3,3,6.12,6.76,0.64,1.0,That's quite fun.
35850,PS3,3,10.48,11.56,1.08,2.0,How would you do that?
35850,PS3,3,12.76,28.8,16.04,2.0,"You'd you'd have to ban it from sort of culture and as in just try and get it out from so any new TV shows or anything, you'd have to sort of you."
35850,PS3,3,29.12,30.88,1.76,3.0,Know propaganda of this world.
35850,PS3,3,31.76,34.12,2.36,2.0,"True, I don't know if you start."
35850,PS3,3,34.52,35.16,0.64,1.0,Suppose if.
35850,PS3,3,35.2,37.44,2.24,3.0,You like sparing words with you.
35850,PS3,3,38.4,38.8,0.4,2.0,"Like, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,39.0,41.72,2.72,1.0,Like if you invented a new word for it.
35850,PS3,3,42.08,44.84,2.76,2.0,"You'd start or you could start a trend, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,44.84,48.52,3.68,3.0,It's like whose names you know this spell or like Woland the more.
35850,PS3,3,49.96,51.0,1.04,2.0,"Yeah, we should."
35850,PS3,3,51.4,57.12,5.72,1.0,So sort of ban the word sorry and then start some trend of.
35850,PS3,3,57.44,60.08,2.64,2.0,Someone else saying oh pardon me?
35850,PS3,3,61.24,61.96,0.72,2.0,Oh yeah.
35850,PS3,3,62.0,66.72,4.72,2.0,So start getting influencers or people in the media.
35850,PS3,3,68.08,68.72,0.64,3.0,Or make like.
35850,PS3,3,68.72,69.2,0.48,2.0,This.
35850,PS3,3,69.68,71.92,2.24,3.0,"This word, like, never existed before."
35850,PS3,3,73.12,73.24,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,73.32,77.28,3.96,3.0,"Like, yeah, man in black."
35850,PS3,3,77.6,78.4,0.8,2.0,The trouble is.
35850,PS3,3,78.8,79.76,0.96,1.0,I guess that's not it.
35850,PS3,3,82.12,86.68,4.56,2.0,"I guess also, you know, time is of the essence with the pandemic."
35850,PS3,3,87.16,91.6,4.44,2.0,How are we going to do this quickly like?
35850,PS3,3,91.6,93.76,2.16,3.0,How to spread the information that week?
35850,PS3,3,95.12,101.64,6.52,2.0,"Yeah, just because I guess the IT will take time to change people's language."
35850,PS3,3,104.24,104.88,0.64,3.0,Or is it like?
35850,PS3,3,104.88,110.52,5.64,2.0,"How do we how do we make it really offensive to say basically no, but."
35850,PS3,3,110.52,113.8,3.28,3.0,"It's not only the word sorry, because it's just in English."
35850,PS3,3,114.28,114.84,0.56,2.0,Because.
35850,PS3,3,115.76,123.28,7.52,3.0,"I guess it spreads like the same way in Russian, but it means sorry as well."
35850,PS3,3,123.96,124.56,0.6,3.0,You know what I mean?
35850,PS3,3,124.72,125.36,0.64,3.0,For example.
35850,PS3,3,125.84,126.24,0.4,3.0,Hold on.
35850,PS3,3,127.2,128.68,1.48,2.0,"That still spreads it, do you reckon?"
35850,PS3,3,128.92,129.16,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,129.16,132.08,2.92,3.0,"It's still like sorry, or is it just word sorry?"
35850,PS3,3,132.08,136.6,4.52,3.0,So it means like it's between like English speakers.
35850,PS3,3,137.24,137.6,0.36,2.0,I don't.
35850,PS3,3,138.0,140.72,2.72,1.0,"Know yeah, because if it's because it's."
35850,PS3,3,140.72,142.24,1.52,3.0,"Like quote, sorry so."
35850,PS3,3,143.36,147.24,3.88,1.0,Like is it just the words or is it just the idea of apologising?
35850,PS3,3,147.36,149.12,1.76,3.0,"UK, American like places like that."
35850,PS3,3,151.4,153.0,1.6,2.0,I guess you're right.
35850,PS3,3,153.28,157.68,4.4,2.0,I think it I think it means the word sorry in each language.
35850,PS3,3,158.92,160.48,1.56,3.0,So even pardon is.
35850,PS3,3,161.24,168.16,6.92,1.0,"OK, well then I suppose we have to remove, remove the concept of apologizing."
35850,PS3,3,168.16,168.4,0.24,1.0,"No, I."
35850,PS3,3,168.44,171.68,3.24,2.0,Think we can create a new word that means?
35850,PS3,3,172.2,174.6,2.4,3.0,"Clubbing, sorry, being thankful."
35850,PS3,3,174.96,175.68,0.72,2.0,"Yeah, thank."
35850,PS3,3,176.12,176.36,0.24,3.0,You.
35850,PS3,3,176.52,176.96,0.44,2.0,Or.
35850,PS3,3,178.28,178.56,0.28,3.0,Like.
35850,PS3,3,179.16,181.4,2.24,2.0,"I just, I think we, I think we can come up with a slang."
35850,PS3,3,181.4,182.36,0.96,2.0,I think that's fine.
35850,PS3,3,182.56,186.24,3.68,3.0,"Yeah, like not saying sorry I'm late."
35850,PS3,3,186.48,188.64,2.16,3.0,It's saying thanks for waiting for me.
35850,PS3,3,189.16,194.8,5.64,2.0,"Yeah, thing I think saying pardon in like pardon me in English is different from saying sorry."
35850,PS3,3,195.32,195.6,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,196.0,196.84,0.84,1.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,197.0,199.24,2.24,2.0,Whereas obviously in French that is different.
35850,PS3,3,200.64,205.28,4.64,2.0,"So I think, I think in each language we just come up with an A replacement."
35850,PS3,3,205.76,206.24,0.48,2.0,Absolutely.
35850,PS3,3,207.28,210.36,3.08,1.0,"So it was something that's like similar but not identical, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,210.44,211.96,1.52,2.0,And then what do we erase?
35850,PS3,3,212.04,219.72,7.68,2.0,"Like, do we, you know, in all Netflix shows and the current media, do we try and make that out?"
35850,PS3,3,220.48,227.4,6.92,3.0,"You will get the like like disease if you say sorry, not if you hear so."
35850,PS3,3,227.6,228.68,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, OK."
35850,PS3,3,228.88,231.08,2.2,2.0,I'm just trying to erase it from everyone's minds.
35850,PS3,3,231.48,233.72,2.24,3.0,So it's like it never existed before.
35850,PS3,3,233.76,236.92,3.16,1.0,"Yeah, OK."
35850,PS3,3,242.16,246.96,4.8,1.0,"And sort of censor, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,255.36,264.2,8.84,3.0,"Like, even if you're going to like, see Tik Tok's videos where all, like, news, you cannot say the word."
35850,PS3,3,264.4,266.32,1.92,3.0,"And they're like, just type this word."
35850,PS3,3,266.72,272.0,5.28,3.0,"And yeah, but out of curiosity, there are people who are going to say it."
35850,PS3,3,272.2,274.48,2.28,3.0,"Yeah, but that their problem."
35850,PS3,3,274.96,275.68,0.72,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,276.4,280.56,4.16,3.0,Like you can jump off the roof if you want to.
35850,PS3,3,280.56,280.76,0.2,3.0,That's.
35850,PS3,3,280.76,281.12,0.36,2.0,Your choice.
35850,PS3,3,281.12,281.88,0.76,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,283.52,284.2,0.68,1.0,That's what you mean.
35850,PS3,3,284.76,288.4,3.64,2.0,Do we do we want to try and make a negative connotation with the word?
35850,PS3,3,289.24,289.88,0.64,2.0,That may or may not.
35850,PS3,3,289.96,292.88,2.92,1.0,"Be true, Wouldn't getting the disease be the negative?"
35850,PS3,3,292.88,294.36,1.48,3.0,Connotation there's no vaccination of.
35850,PS3,3,294.44,298.44,4.0,2.0,"The true OK, yeah, yeah, we can correlate the word."
35850,PS3,3,298.88,300.8,1.92,1.0,Like a public awareness.
35850,PS3,3,301.44,302.12,0.68,2.0,"Scheme, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,302.8,303.28,0.48,1.0,At the same time.
35850,PS3,3,305.64,306.0,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,314.45,316.13,1.68,2.0,Do you remember going to Australia?
35850,PS3,3,316.37,318.73,2.36,2.0,"You know, they'd, they were really strict with food."
35850,PS3,3,318.85,319.77,0.92,2.0,"Yeah, and they were."
35850,PS3,3,319.93,322.13,2.2,2.0,"I just remember them saying don't be sorry, be better."
35850,PS3,3,323.65,325.61,1.96,1.0,"Sorry, that's so Australian."
35850,PS3,3,326.37,327.33,0.96,1.0,Don't be sorry mate.
35850,PS3,3,339.94,340.26,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS3,3,341.44,341.68,0.24,3.0,Cool.
35850,PS3,3,342.24,343.36,1.12,1.0,Are we sort of happy with that?
35850,PS3,3,345.8,346.12,0.32,1.0,"Yep, yeah."
35850,PS3,3,347.2,347.8,0.6,3.0,Can we become?
35850,PS3,3,348.12,349.52,1.4,2.0,Can we be any more creative?
35850,PS3,3,349.6,351.12,1.52,2.0,I just don't know what they mean by.
35850,PS3,3,351.88,352.4,0.52,1.0,Creative.
35850,PS3,3,353.56,355.72,2.16,3.0,The question itself is already created.
35850,PS3,3,356.08,356.48,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, that's a."
35850,PS3,3,356.48,356.8,0.32,3.0,Good point.
35850,PS3,3,356.8,357.68,0.88,3.0,So yeah.
35850,PS3,3,358.08,360.48,2.4,1.0,And also it says just like one creative idea.
35850,PS3,3,360.48,363.0,2.52,1.0,So just one thing.
35850,PS3,3,363.76,364.64,0.88,1.0,"OK, this one."
35850,PS3,3,365.68,365.8,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35420,PS3,6,6.52,7.76,1.24,1.0,"Kill the British, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,9.88,11.04,1.16,2.0,That's the creative idea.
35420,PS3,6,11.04,11.24,0.2,2.0,Polish.
35420,PS3,6,11.68,11.96,0.28,3.0,As well.
35420,PS3,6,12.8,13.92,1.12,4.0,How does it make you feel?
35420,PS3,6,14.0,15.08,1.08,5.0,"Yeah, I."
35420,PS3,6,15.08,20.12,5.04,2.0,Know give everyone shock bracelets that every time they say the word shy they they get like a shock like.
35420,PS3,6,21.48,21.84,0.36,4.0,A vaccine.
35420,PS3,6,22.08,23.76,1.68,6.0,But then then get a shock and the.
35420,PS3,6,26.2,28.0,1.8,2.0,But it might not be transmitted.
35420,PS3,6,28.16,29.32,1.16,2.0,It's only if they've got it.
35420,PS3,6,29.32,41.08,11.76,2.0,So or just like tell everyone to say my apologies instead of sorry.
35420,PS3,6,41.4,45.28,3.88,2.0,"Something like that, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,46.08,55.32,9.24,3.0,"Yeah, like like a device for the mouth that would like not making, not able to say sorry, like, you know, you can't make this or some."
35420,PS3,6,56.48,57.76,1.28,1.0,Just banned speech.
35420,PS3,6,58.24,60.72,2.48,1.0,People can only communicate by text and writing.
35420,PS3,6,61.08,61.92,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,62.84,65.8,2.96,3.0,Also just not English because I I guess in another language.
35420,PS3,6,66.56,70.2,3.64,2.0,"Oh yeah, literally just like make everyone to learn another language that's not."
35420,PS3,6,70.2,72.16,1.96,1.0,"Important, just kill everyone who speaks English."
35420,PS3,6,72.76,73.04,0.28,5.0,Don't.
35420,PS3,6,75.24,76.6,1.36,4.0,"She's heavily killing, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,76.92,78.64,1.72,1.0,"Well, I'm just like, yeah, it's not."
35420,PS3,6,78.92,80.8,1.88,1.0,It's not allowed to suggest that kind of thing.
35420,PS3,6,81.44,82.76,1.32,1.0,It's not allowed to be violent.
35420,PS3,6,83.52,87.32,3.8,1.0,"It's like if you're asking it to do something, they're like, sorry, we're not programmed to do."
35420,PS3,6,87.36,87.48,0.12,5.0,This.
35420,PS3,6,87.92,88.04,0.12,1.0,OK.
35420,PS3,6,88.8,91.76,2.96,2.0,"Cool, but I feel like getting everyone to say like sorry in a different language."
35420,PS3,6,92.48,93.96,1.48,1.0,"That's not going to happen, I know."
35420,PS3,6,94.36,96.4,2.04,2.0,But it doesn't have to be like realistic.
35420,PS3,6,96.4,99.44,3.04,2.0,We only realistic ideas the first time so.
35420,PS3,6,101.6,104.6,3.0,5.0,"Yeah, I feel like killing everyone can't be almost realistic."
35420,PS3,6,105.0,105.16,0.16,2.0,Idea.
35420,PS3,6,111.32,126.48,15.16,6.0,"What about something that's sort of, you know, like how TV has delayed transmission delay by 5 seconds so that it could be edited out somehow?"
35420,PS3,6,127.28,129.48,2.2,4.0,Select delayed speech in seeing.
35420,PS3,6,129.56,130.32,0.76,6.0,"Kind of, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,130.32,133.52,3.2,6.0,So you can like catch it before it's actually.
35420,PS3,6,133.52,140.44,6.92,1.0,Everyone could get like Stephen Hawking speech things and they just are programmed to not have.
35420,PS3,6,140.44,140.92,0.48,1.0,Sorry.
35420,PS3,6,141.6,144.96,3.36,3.0,"Yeah, true, but also like if they say it then."
35420,PS3,6,145.16,145.36,0.2,5.0,It is.
35420,PS3,6,145.44,145.84,0.4,3.0,Sorry.
35420,PS3,6,147.12,150.52,3.4,2.0,"Oh, just yeah, I get the computer to just bleep out the word sorry."
35420,PS3,6,150.8,151.6,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, I'm thinking."
35420,PS3,6,151.6,152.2,0.6,6.0,Sensory.
35420,PS3,6,152.32,152.8,0.48,4.0,Yeah.
35420,PS3,6,153.12,158.12,5.0,4.0,And the increasing and regulatory that when into the brain that deletes the memory of the word sorry from the memory.
35420,PS3,6,158.56,159.8,1.24,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,160.2,164.16,3.96,4.0,"Such that even if you're remorseful, you cannot express it with words."
35420,PS3,6,164.56,168.52,3.96,5.0,Surely like you know how like Elon Musk has got like neural input?
35420,PS3,6,169.0,170.28,1.28,5.0,What attaches to your brain?
35420,PS3,6,171.16,172.88,1.72,5.0,"Sure, you could like modify that."
35420,PS3,6,173.48,174.8,1.32,4.0,"Yeah, we're going to take."
35420,PS3,6,175.36,175.72,0.36,5.0,Why?
35420,PS3,6,175.92,176.92,1.0,5.0,Why can't the words?
35420,PS3,6,176.92,177.28,0.36,5.0,"Sorry, Yeah."
35420,PS3,6,178.16,178.32,0.16,1.0,From.
35420,PS3,6,179.76,180.64,0.88,4.0,Vocabulary.
35420,PS3,6,181.76,182.48,0.72,6.0,Electroshock.
35420,PS3,6,184.08,187.64,3.56,4.0,The ethical it's.
35420,PS3,6,187.8,188.4,0.6,1.0,Probably greater.
35420,PS3,6,188.76,190.04,1.28,4.0,"Good society, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,192.32,193.28,0.96,1.0,The greater good.
35420,PS3,6,193.96,197.84,3.88,4.0,It's running.
35420,PS3,6,198.6,199.88,1.28,5.0,"No, I got it."
35420,PS3,6,204.44,206.16,1.72,6.0,"Well, this is the word, I think."
35420,PS3,6,206.16,208.84,2.68,6.0,"So I touched on it, on the feeling of regret, right?"
35420,PS3,6,209.52,212.8,3.28,2.0,But I think it's translated by saying the word sorry inclusive.
35420,PS3,6,212.8,214.16,1.36,2.0,So it's just the word sorry.
35420,PS3,6,214.16,215.32,1.16,2.0,You can say any other word.
35420,PS3,6,215.48,218.04,2.56,1.0,"You can say I regret that, I apologise."
35420,PS3,6,219.12,221.08,1.96,3.0,"No, Potentially we also have a full word."
35420,PS3,6,221.08,221.84,0.76,2.0,We're just reading.
35420,PS3,6,222.12,222.72,0.6,3.0,The regret.
35420,PS3,6,226.68,227.64,0.96,6.0,Killing a lot more.
35420,PS3,6,228.44,230.12,1.68,4.0,"Yeah, people would have no functions."
35420,PS3,6,234.6,235.32,0.72,5.0,I didn't regret.
35420,PS3,6,235.96,237.04,1.08,4.0,That anyone?
35420,PS3,6,241.12,241.56,0.44,1.0,Else I'm.
35420,PS3,6,243.92,244.2,0.28,4.0,Happy with?
35420,PS3,6,247.44,247.64,0.2,1.0,That.
35420,PS3,6,248.24,251.0,2.76,5.0,That solution like you can't do any more than that.
35420,PS3,6,251.04,254.84,3.8,5.0,"Yeah, problem stops the word sorry from being said."
35420,PS3,6,255.8,256.2,0.4,5.0,But how?
35420,PS3,6,256.2,261.32,5.12,5.0,How like realistic and like plausible these ideas have to be?
35420,PS3,6,262.12,263.0,0.88,1.0,"Not at all, no."
35420,PS3,6,264.04,264.48,0.44,2.0,"No, I."
35420,PS3,6,264.48,266.84,2.36,4.0,"Just we didn't think we could go to space, but we did."
35420,PS3,6,267.36,268.68,1.32,4.0,It wasn't possible at the time.
35420,PS3,6,270.0,271.12,1.12,4.0,Anything is possible now.
35420,PS3,6,272.44,275.16,2.72,4.0,How about the the kids coming up?
35420,PS3,6,276.72,278.68,1.96,4.0,Because they will learn to say sorry so.
35420,PS3,6,278.68,280.88,2.2,4.0,But we have only learned sorry.
35420,PS3,6,281.52,286.08,4.56,1.0,"Oh, they should learn to say sorry, because they will learn from us and we will no longer have the word sorry."
35420,PS3,6,286.64,294.44,7.8,5.0,"It's true, though, that by the time kids like that generation is like the bulk, society will be about 20 years old."
35420,PS3,6,297.4,298.48,1.08,1.0,And they can also get trips.
35420,PS3,6,302.52,304.08,1.56,4.0,I like her developing the idea.
35420,PS3,6,305.76,308.48,2.72,4.0,I think accessibility now that would cost a lot.
35420,PS3,6,311.64,313.2,1.56,1.0,We have endless resources.
35420,PS3,6,313.52,315.2,1.68,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,315.48,320.04,4.56,3.0,"I mean, I guess we should also isolate people before while we're manufacturing."
35420,PS3,6,320.04,321.96,1.92,5.0,Isolating people who have done something wrong.
35420,PS3,6,324.8,325.2,0.4,1.0,Like for.
35420,PS3,6,325.28,325.88,0.6,3.0,Example.
35420,PS3,6,327.64,328.0,0.36,5.0,Yeah.
35420,PS3,6,329.32,331.44,2.12,3.0,I wonder how many times I said sorry today it.
35420,PS3,6,331.48,332.08,0.6,1.0,Was probably.
35420,PS3,6,332.08,332.76,0.68,5.0,A lot so.
35420,PS3,6,333.6,334.24,0.64,4.0,Many people I.
35420,PS3,6,334.24,336.72,2.48,5.0,Feel like trying to squeeze past people in the streets?
35420,PS3,6,336.8,337.28,0.48,5.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35420,PS3,6,338.8,340.28,1.48,2.0,What's the French word for sorry?
35420,PS3,6,340.28,342.12,1.84,2.0,Like pardon or pardon?
35420,PS3,6,342.4,345.8,3.4,2.0,Just just just make people say pardon instead.
35420,PS3,6,345.8,346.28,0.48,2.0,You can.
35420,PS3,6,346.28,346.68,0.4,3.0,Just say.
35420,PS3,6,347.04,347.44,0.4,2.0,Apologies.
35420,PS3,6,347.6,348.16,0.56,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35420,PS3,6,352.16,352.48,0.32,5.0,Too far.
35420,PS3,6,352.48,355.92,3.44,5.0,I feel like this is pretty creative.
35420,PS3,6,356.6,356.76,0.16,5.0,Yep.
35420,PS3,6,357.04,364.6,7.56,5.0,"But, you know, if this was to happen, if this pandemic was to happen tomorrow, I don't think our solution is getting chosen."
35420,PS3,6,366.16,367.04,0.88,5.0,But it is creative.
35420,PS3,6,367.04,367.2,0.16,5.0,What?
35420,PS3,6,367.56,367.68,0.12,2.0,Would.

35897,PS5,3,76.72,80.4,3.68,2.0,"But each Christmas, like, like, you know, employee satisfaction would be like below the ground."
35897,PS5,3,83.36,87.64,4.28,1.0,Or what like reduction of valued talent?

35897,PS5,3,97.32,101.6,4.28,2.0,"No, but if you think about why does an employee decide to leave the companies because they."
35897,PS5,3,101.6,103.16,1.56,1.0,"They found a better employer, no?"
35897,PS5,3,103.16,112.32,9.16,2.0,"No, it's usually one of two things A they get paid more elsewhere for what what they do or B they have more company benefits or slash better work life balance."
35897,PS5,3,112.6,114.96,2.36,2.0,So you want to tackle these two things where you.
35897,PS5,3,115.16,120.72,5.56,1.0,Or you just tackle all the other companies and get rid of them so that you're the only possible employer.
35897,PS5,3,123.92,127.04,3.12,2.0,"Me and I, me and I didn't get stressed out because we don't complete the other end of the spectrum."

35897,PS5,3,157.0,163.72,6.72,1.0,Can you both provide better benefits while driving like out your like your competitors?
35897,PS5,3,164.36,171.32,6.96,2.0,"You don't need to like just just give more employee benefits like, you know."
35897,PS5,3,171.96,174.44,2.48,1.0,Free com but I'm an evil capitalist.
35897,PS5,3,179.84,186.56,6.72,2.0,"But in the in the long run, you'll save more money by retaining your older employees rather than letting them."
35897,PS5,3,186.6,187.0,0.4,2.0,And I can.
35897,PS5,3,187.0,189.24,2.24,1.0,Earn more money by driving out my competitors.
35897,PS5,3,190.44,193.16,2.72,2.0,"We're not talking about competitors, we're talking about retaining employees."
35897,PS5,3,193.16,193.36,0.2,2.0,But my.
35897,PS5,3,193.36,201.04,7.68,1.0,Competitors are the ones who are also recruiting or trying to dig away my employees right reduction.
35897,PS5,3,201.64,207.48,5.84,2.0,"Of value on the flip side, you're the one driving your employees out because of your work life balance all the way your company runs so you got."
35897,PS5,3,207.48,211.2,3.72,1.0,"No, no, no, I've I've been providing sufficient like benefits."
35897,PS5,3,211.2,220.0,8.8,1.0,"It's just that they're too like, greedy and they're never satiable about like, you know, they're 20 days like leave, like, you know."

35897,PS5,3,222.28,225.56,3.28,2.0,"So practically, I think we increase."
35897,PS5,3,226.04,238.52,12.48,1.0,The create like a society such that unemployment rate is so high that you don't worry about your workers leaving because you can always recruit more talents and better ones.
35897,PS5,3,243.08,250.44,7.36,2.0,"So you can have like a birthday off work or something and then like something to do with childcare, childcare support."

35897,PS5,3,272.32,275.0,2.68,3.0,"What if the company like one, has an?"
35897,PS5,3,275.0,276.8,1.8,1.0,Open 20 branches worldwide.
35897,PS5,3,276.8,277.16,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35897,PS5,3,277.28,278.48,1.2,3.0,Opens more branches and.
35897,PS5,3,278.48,280.16,1.68,1.0,By driving out my competitors.
35897,PS5,3,281.72,288.36,6.64,3.0,And then supports them like through along the transition process as they're moving to a new place so that they remain see.
35897,PS5,3,288.36,294.6,6.24,1.0,"You can always treat your workers better, but I don't think that's one of the reason they like, I don't know, they."
35897,PS5,3,294.64,295.28,0.64,3.0,Leave the company.
35897,PS5,3,295.36,303.88,8.52,2.0,"Really, I think ultimately you gotta, I feel like you've got to be extremely flexible with employees to get the best out of them."
35897,PS5,3,304.32,307.8,3.48,2.0,"And things like, you know, OK, these are recommended hours."
35897,PS5,3,307.88,311.8,3.92,2.0,"We can work as much as you want to, but we focus more on the output rather than working hours."
35897,PS5,3,312.08,314.96,2.88,2.0,And so it's up to them to be autonomous and to manage their own time.
35897,PS5,3,314.96,316.8,1.84,2.0,It's all the work like working from home thing.
35897,PS5,3,317.2,317.52,0.32,1.0,Yeah.

35897,PS5,3,323.0,329.68,6.68,2.0,"Yeah, exactly because that then it it's kind of a it allows everyone to work going to what fits that highs."
35897,PS5,3,330.44,330.92,0.48,3.0,Exactly.
35897,PS5,3,331.24,343.6,12.36,2.0,"So things like I hope you get your birthday off, work for free, paid like childcare, school, medical insurance, slash pension schemes, have things that work like gyms, game room, something for like a break."

35897,PS5,3,356.28,357.0,0.72,3.0,Exactly.
35897,PS5,3,357.16,369.88,12.72,3.0,"I think all these things will help employees feel like their company and their job is making their life better, so they're less inclined to like detach themselves from that part of their life."
35897,PS5,3,370.56,371.0,0.44,3.0,But your.
35897,PS5,3,371.0,373.12,2.12,1.0,Competitors can also do the same thing.
35897,PS5,3,374.68,375.88,1.2,2.0,You're focusing your own company.
35897,PS5,3,375.88,376.28,0.4,2.0,You can't.
35897,PS5,3,376.36,378.64,2.28,2.0,You can't control what the competitors do.
35897,PS5,3,379.12,384.6,5.48,1.0,"You can drive them out of business, in which case then you can control what they're doing."
35897,PS5,3,385.28,397.72,12.44,1.0,"I'm literally like, I mean, I stand as an evil capitalist in this and I'm literally like, you know, the ways in which you solve this issue is not by like making their life better, but making others life more miserable."
35897,PS5,3,400.76,405.16,4.4,1.0,"And I feel like it's so cliche to just say, come on, provide workers better benefits."
35897,PS5,3,406.36,413.96,7.6,1.0,"It's like, surely we're all going to say this thing without actually acting on them because no, like evil capitalist employer would actually do these."
35897,PS5,3,416.88,419.04,2.16,3.0,Adobe has great employment.
35897,PS5,3,419.04,419.24,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35897,PS5,3,419.24,423.96,4.72,1.0,"I guess most companies technically, yeah."
35897,PS5,3,424.04,425.68,1.64,1.0,What's their head like sort of do.
35897,PS5,3,425.68,432.4,6.72,1.0,But also I'm like you need to maintain like a very significant profit margin in order to do that.
35897,PS5,3,433.24,440.68,7.44,1.0,And the ways in which you maintain that like significant high profit margin is by baking the industry of which you're operating in less competitive?
35897,PS5,3,441.24,442.76,1.52,2.0,"Oh yeah, but also you could."
35897,PS5,3,443.28,444.36,1.08,1.0,By maintaining some sort.
35897,PS5,3,444.36,448.32,3.96,2.0,Of you maintain a higher profit margin by encouraging things that work from home because you're not paying rent or anything like.
35897,PS5,3,449.04,449.16,0.12,1.0,That.
35897,PS5,3,450.72,451.72,1.0,2.0,So it's like if you kind.
35897,PS5,3,451.72,476.56,24.84,1.0,"Of but overall like the benefits like it's basically like cutting, like cutting costs is obviously one aspect of it, but you're like ability to like set the price is very much dependent upon upon the level of competition in that market, in which case then maintaining sort of semi monopolistic or oligoptilistic position in the market is extremely important."
35897,PS5,3,476.68,480.56,3.88,2.0,"Which is fine, except you can't control the market, you can't control the businesses."
35897,PS5,3,480.56,483.8,3.24,2.0,Like there's no way you can like basically drive other people out.
35897,PS5,3,483.8,487.12,3.32,2.0,You got to you got to maintain your internal system.
35897,PS5,3,487.12,490.4,3.28,2.0,Make that the best it can be before you even look at your competitors.
35897,PS5,3,492.32,498.64,6.32,2.0,"Like you're right, but there's no way you can, you like yourself as a company can just drive everyone else out that that's not how it works."
35897,PS5,3,498.64,501.24,2.6,2.0,"Unless you were like a mega company like Google, you just buy everyone out."
35897,PS5,3,501.88,502.6,0.72,1.0,Which they did.
35897,PS5,3,502.84,504.12,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, which they basically have done."
35897,PS5,3,504.64,507.56,2.92,1.0,"And they don't provide like majority of their employees, good benefits."
35897,PS5,3,507.84,511.6,3.76,1.0,It's only like a small fraction of the people who are at the headquarters that enjoy these benefits.
35897,PS5,3,516.16,516.76,0.6,1.0,We got a tie.
35897,PS5,3,516.92,536.84,19.92,2.0,"So basically I reckon including benefits like benefits like having birthday off, work paid and childcare support, medical insurance or whatever, but also encouraging work from home so then people can work from wherever they want in the world as long as you get in the output."
35897,PS5,3,547.16,553.24,6.08,1.0,Work child caring breaks.
35897,PS5,3,555.24,556.36,1.12,2.0,"No, just child care support."
35897,PS5,3,556.36,557.2,0.84,2.0,You don't have to be great.
35897,PS5,3,557.24,569.28,12.04,2.0,"So just child care support, medical insurance, this discount for local businesses, paid birthday off work."
35897,PS5,3,574.52,575.2,0.68,1.0,What's the other one?

35897,PS5,3,582.6,584.04,1.44,2.0,"Yeah, discounts for local businesses."
35897,PS5,3,590.08,606.12,16.04,2.0,"And then just like freedom to move roles within the company, so freedom to move around having some roles and then just say like we can have like a focus on output rather than working."
35897,PS5,3,606.16,609.56,3.4,1.0,"I said that at the beginning, yeah."
35897,PS5,3,609.76,610.28,0.52,2.0,"Result, yeah."
35897,PS5,3,617.64,618.84,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, I think that's pretty much."
35897,PS5,3,619.12,620.68,1.56,1.0,It I don't like this but OK.
35897,PS5,3,621.08,622.04,0.96,2.0,"Well, what would you say?"
35897,PS5,3,623.4,625.32,1.92,1.0,The evil capitalist version of the answer?
35897,PS5,3,625.32,626.0,0.68,1.0,"Come on, what?"

35897,PS5,3,634.32,635.24,0.92,3.0,"I don't know, like Wolf."
35897,PS5,3,639.08,646.56,7.48,1.0,But also I think you should be sneaky about your contracts when you're signing them such that you makes basically leaving the company a bit more difficult.
35897,PS5,3,647.6,648.76,1.16,2.0,"No, but you can get sued for that."
35897,PS5,3,649.44,650.92,1.48,2.0,There has to be legal implications for that.
35897,PS5,3,650.92,651.68,0.76,2.0,You can't just do that.
35897,PS5,3,652.52,653.08,0.56,2.0,It's not a single.
35897,PS5,3,653.08,653.56,0.48,1.0,Depends.
35897,PS5,3,653.56,655.52,1.96,1.0,Depends on which market you're operating in.
35897,PS5,3,655.52,664.52,9.0,1.0,"It doesn't necessarily say that you're operating in a country that has sufficient, let's say, enforcement of labour law protection, right?"
35897,PS5,3,665.12,669.56,4.44,1.0,You could be operating in a developing countries context during which these things do.
35897,PS5,3,669.56,670.08,0.52,2.0,Not exist.
35897,PS5,3,670.32,672.48,2.16,2.0,Can you ethically operate like that?
35897,PS5,3,673.4,674.88,1.48,2.0,That's not ethical at all.
35897,PS5,3,675.24,680.8,5.56,1.0,"But also, your fellow competitors may be operating under the same exact unethical guidelines."
35897,PS5,3,681.12,686.88,5.76,2.0,"I would argue that if you reduce company morale, you're not going to get any sort of any good output."
35897,PS5,3,689.8,691.96,2.16,2.0,"When a company is happy, they can produce the output you want."
35897,PS5,3,691.96,692.8,0.84,2.0,That's what I would argue.
35897,PS5,3,694.16,705.64,11.48,1.0,"But also you're basically setting up like sort of like a barrier for exit without necessarily creating any additional cost or impact on while they're on their rolls, right?"
35897,PS5,3,707.56,708.76,1.2,3.0,"Yeah, that's also a problem."
35897,PS5,3,708.76,709.88,1.12,3.0,It just makes them miserable.
35897,PS5,3,710.76,711.04,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
35897,PS5,3,711.88,712.48,0.6,1.0,Does it though?
35897,PS5,3,713.0,713.32,0.32,2.0,It does.
35897,PS5,3,713.32,714.2,0.88,2.0,"No, I think you say it does."
35897,PS5,3,714.52,714.92,0.4,2.0,Trust me.
35897,PS5,3,716.6,716.92,0.32,2.0,Trust me.
35897,PS5,3,717.36,718.32,0.96,1.0,I'm just a devil's advocate.
35260,PS2,6,2.8,9.84,7.04,1.0,Vulnerabilities within the supply chain to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules is called one case body.

35260,PS2,6,13.08,14.52,1.44,1.0,Surely they need insecurity?
35260,PS2,6,17.52,21.36,3.84,2.0,"And do we have to like, write something into it after discussion or Yeah."
35260,PS2,6,22.04,22.56,0.52,3.0,I think so.
35260,PS2,6,24.64,24.76,0.12,1.0,OK.
35260,PS2,6,25.56,28.16,2.6,2.0,Is this like all the information you got about it?
35260,PS2,6,28.16,31.4,3.24,1.0,"So I mean, there's some worst vulnerabilities, yes."
35260,PS2,6,35.72,42.24,6.52,1.0,"So that might come from concentrated in your supply chain in like 1 specific region, like how we sit on Ukraine."
35260,PS2,6,42.32,42.44,0.12,1.0,How?
35260,PS2,6,42.56,42.72,0.16,1.0,Yeah.

35260,PS2,6,56.48,57.52,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, especially now."

35260,PS2,6,70.12,71.56,1.44,1.0,What are the vulnerabilities?
35260,PS2,6,71.72,72.84,1.12,4.0,"OK, first let's talk."
35260,PS2,6,74.36,76.12,1.76,5.0,We need to brainstorming.
35260,PS2,6,76.12,77.08,0.96,4.0,"On this question, right?"
35260,PS2,6,77.72,79.08,1.36,6.0,"OK, so."
35260,PS2,6,79.76,80.56,0.8,5.0,If you look.
35260,PS2,6,80.56,80.8,0.24,6.0,At.
35260,PS2,6,81.2,81.92,0.72,4.0,The question.
35260,PS2,6,82.24,83.4,1.16,6.0,It says vulnerability.
35260,PS2,6,83.4,83.72,0.32,5.0,Within the.
35260,PS2,6,83.84,84.24,0.4,6.0,Supply.
35260,PS2,6,84.24,85.12,0.88,5.0,Chain could lead to.
35260,PS2,6,85.2,86.32,1.12,6.0,Uncontrolled cost.
35260,PS2,6,86.76,88.72,1.96,5.0,And insufficient delivery schedules.
35260,PS2,6,89.24,89.72,0.48,4.0,And.
35260,PS2,6,89.72,90.6,0.88,6.0,We need to have a.
35260,PS2,6,90.6,93.16,2.56,5.0,Creative idea to tackle those vulnerabilities in Sharp.
35260,PS2,6,93.88,94.36,0.48,6.0,So.
35260,PS2,6,95.28,95.68,0.4,5.0,In my.
35260,PS2,6,96.36,96.64,0.28,6.0,What?
35260,PS2,6,97.44,100.4,2.96,4.0,I'm asking your opinions should.
35260,PS2,6,101.08,101.8,0.72,5.0,We should we start.
35260,PS2,6,102.68,103.84,1.16,6.0,"First, what?"
35260,PS2,6,103.84,106.0,2.16,5.0,Are the vulnerabilities then?
35260,PS2,6,106.28,107.56,1.28,4.0,"If you find the problem, then we."
35260,PS2,6,107.56,108.28,0.72,5.0,Can easily.
35260,PS2,6,108.28,108.64,0.36,4.0,Find the.
35260,PS2,6,108.64,108.92,0.28,3.0,Problem.
35260,PS2,6,109.36,109.48,0.12,6.0,Right.
35260,PS2,6,110.76,113.64,2.88,3.0,But the first two things comes to our minds.
35260,PS2,6,113.68,115.8,2.12,3.0,"Wars like in Korean, Russian."
35260,PS2,6,115.8,116.0,0.2,6.0,War.
35260,PS2,6,116.04,116.48,0.44,6.0,Totally agree.
35260,PS2,6,117.04,120.08,3.04,3.0,And the the region like if you can protect some.
35260,PS2,6,120.68,121.76,1.08,5.0,I think I have got.
35260,PS2,6,121.76,122.4,0.64,4.0,A notes.
35260,PS2,6,122.8,123.64,0.84,3.0,White world over there.
35260,PS2,6,124.76,125.32,0.56,5.0,I don't.
35260,PS2,6,125.32,125.76,0.44,4.0,Trust.
35260,PS2,6,125.76,126.2,0.44,6.0,The boats.
35260,PS2,6,126.24,126.72,0.48,4.0,Because you know.
35260,PS2,6,127.48,128.4,0.92,5.0,I I don't like to.
35260,PS2,6,128.52,129.36,0.84,5.0,I have never used you.
35260,PS2,6,129.36,130.0,0.64,4.0,Know really I've got no.
35260,PS2,6,131.92,136.0,4.08,6.0,Notes so the first.
35260,PS2,6,136.6,139.12,2.52,4.0,Vulnerability of the problem you are.
35260,PS2,6,139.56,141.16,1.6,6.0,US talk about is about.
35260,PS2,6,142.8,143.32,0.52,4.0,The supply.

35260,PS2,6,144.4,144.64,0.24,4.0,In a.
35260,PS2,6,144.84,146.56,1.72,5.0,"Nutshell, like trade corridors."
35260,PS2,6,147.04,149.16,2.12,5.0,They're like Egypt right now in Israel.
35260,PS2,6,149.28,150.32,1.04,4.0,And philistine war.
35260,PS2,6,150.32,150.92,0.6,6.0,Like the?

35260,PS2,6,152.64,152.92,0.28,6.0,Like.
35260,PS2,6,153.56,154.08,0.52,4.0,We can say.
35260,PS2,6,154.6,154.8,0.2,6.0,The.
35260,PS2,6,155.32,156.64,1.32,4.0,Supply chain problem.
35260,PS2,6,161.04,161.44,0.4,5.0,Any other?
35260,PS2,6,161.44,161.84,0.4,4.0,Ideas.
35260,PS2,6,162.6,163.44,0.84,4.0,Vulnerabilities.
35260,PS2,6,165.6,166.4,0.8,3.0,The politics.
35260,PS2,6,166.4,167.08,0.68,1.0,Problem.
35260,PS2,6,167.28,167.92,0.64,3.0,Policies.
35260,PS2,6,167.92,168.52,0.6,1.0,Problem.
35260,PS2,6,169.12,170.36,1.24,5.0,Politics and.
35260,PS2,6,170.36,171.04,0.68,4.0,Policies.
35260,PS2,6,177.08,178.96,1.88,5.0,Can you elaborate like?
35260,PS2,6,179.52,195.96,16.44,3.0,"Elaborate or let's just say the for semiconductive the semi chips and if you want to import some chips from Taiwan to China, maybe America can regulate that they're not not allowed any chips being imported from Taiwan to China."
35260,PS2,6,196.92,197.64,0.72,6.0,That's true.
35260,PS2,6,197.64,198.8,1.16,6.0,I totally agree with you.
35260,PS2,6,198.96,200.52,1.56,6.0,But don't you think you are?
35260,PS2,6,201.88,202.28,0.4,6.0,I mean.
35260,PS2,6,202.32,203.36,1.04,5.0,What you say is out.
35260,PS2,6,203.36,206.24,2.88,6.0,Of the question because it's.
35260,PS2,6,206.96,207.32,0.36,4.0,I mean.
35260,PS2,6,207.4,207.8,0.4,5.0,You.
35260,PS2,6,208.44,208.84,0.4,6.0,Look through.
35260,PS2,6,208.84,212.4,3.56,5.0,"The question again, what you?"
35260,PS2,6,212.4,212.64,0.24,6.0,Say is.
35260,PS2,6,212.64,213.8,1.16,5.0,About political issues.
35260,PS2,6,213.8,214.4,0.6,4.0,And so.
35260,PS2,6,214.44,215.08,0.64,6.0,Far although.
35260,PS2,6,215.08,217.84,2.76,4.0,"The wars and, you know, the supply chain problems are also I."
35260,PS2,6,217.88,223.24,5.36,3.0,"Mean like in this scenario, this this is American government is going to regulate that regulate, Yep, Taiwan."
35260,PS2,6,224.12,224.36,0.24,6.0,So.
35260,PS2,6,225.6,226.36,0.76,4.0,"OK, let's."
35260,PS2,6,226.36,228.44,2.08,5.0,Consider that that governance.
35260,PS2,6,228.64,228.88,0.24,4.0,Yeah.
35260,PS2,6,229.48,230.04,0.56,3.0,Like government?
35260,PS2,6,230.4,231.0,0.6,5.0,Governance.
35260,PS2,6,231.4,231.52,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35260,PS2,6,231.52,232.24,0.72,5.0,Government or?
35260,PS2,6,232.28,233.36,1.08,4.0,So and so and.
35260,PS2,6,233.4,233.64,0.24,6.0,More and.
35260,PS2,6,233.64,233.76,0.12,1.0,More.
35260,PS2,6,234.08,235.24,1.16,1.0,And you give us another role model.
35260,PS2,6,235.32,236.4,1.08,1.0,We'll see.
35260,PS2,6,237.16,238.16,1.0,1.0,Why don't you give us one?
35260,PS2,6,238.24,239.56,1.32,1.0,What's another vulnerability?
35260,PS2,6,239.72,240.0,0.28,4.0,OK.
35260,PS2,6,240.04,241.48,1.44,5.0,My vulnerability.
35260,PS2,6,241.48,242.24,0.76,6.0,Is about.
35260,PS2,6,242.68,244.36,1.68,5.0,The security.
35260,PS2,6,244.4,245.32,0.92,4.0,Of you know.
35260,PS2,6,247.52,248.28,0.76,3.0,Cyber security.
35260,PS2,6,248.92,249.48,0.56,5.0,You can say.
35260,PS2,6,250.72,252.28,1.56,6.0,But apart.
35260,PS2,6,252.28,255.0,2.72,4.0,From that for example.
35260,PS2,6,255.92,258.6,2.68,6.0,"All of I don't know about UK, but let's say."
35260,PS2,6,260.76,261.04,0.28,5.0,I was.
35260,PS2,6,261.04,263.92,2.88,4.0,In Singapore and the milk of Singapore.
35260,PS2,6,264.72,265.4,0.68,5.0,All the milk.
35260,PS2,6,265.4,268.68,3.28,4.0,"Comes from Australia, Japan and."
35260,PS2,6,269.2,269.72,0.52,5.0,Maybe.
35260,PS2,6,269.76,270.24,0.48,4.0,France.
35260,PS2,6,270.72,272.44,1.72,4.0,"No, not France, but UK maybe."
35260,PS2,6,272.56,275.08,2.52,6.0,So like.
35260,PS2,6,275.4,277.28,1.88,5.0,What is the maximum?
35260,PS2,6,277.36,277.6,0.24,4.0,You know.
35260,PS2,6,278.84,279.4,0.56,5.0,Tenure.
35260,PS2,6,282.04,283.2,1.16,6.0,You know that milk?
35260,PS2,6,283.32,284.56,1.24,5.0,Is a perishable group it.
35260,PS2,6,284.56,286.08,1.52,4.0,Cannot sustain for too long.
35260,PS2,6,286.36,286.52,0.16,5.0,Like.
35260,PS2,6,286.64,288.36,1.72,4.0,Maximum 15.
35260,PS2,6,288.36,289.16,0.8,6.0,"Or two days, OK."
35260,PS2,6,290.24,291.32,1.08,3.0,Let's just say 15 days.
35260,PS2,6,291.8,292.08,0.28,4.0,OK.
35260,PS2,6,292.16,293.04,0.88,6.0,So the.

36291,PS6,3,161.16,166.28,5.12,2.0,"And the shower can, like, have a rhythm of its own which makes you sing or something."
36291,PS6,3,167.04,167.68,0.64,2.0,Is that it?
36291,PS6,3,167.68,167.84,0.16,2.0,"Yeah, I."
36291,PS6,3,169.36,173.16,3.8,1.0,Wouldn't say that's super useful because imagine your water going on in and out.

36291,PS6,3,179.52,182.92,3.4,2.0,"But I think more than more than singing, it would make you dance."
36291,PS6,3,183.76,192.16,8.4,2.0,"Yeah, no like dance while singing or or somehow how about how about we do?"
36291,PS6,3,193.32,194.68,1.36,1.0,Do we have to keep them in the shower?
36291,PS6,3,195.24,196.04,0.8,2.0,You know how you have?

36291,PS6,3,214.4,227.96,13.56,2.0,"Because I feel like the at least at least like if you're in the the northeastern side of India, you do have like the concept of just having like a communal bath and you just are like 2-3 people in like a sauna or something and just chilling."
36291,PS6,3,228.84,229.28,0.44,2.0,Yeah.

36291,PS6,3,236.04,237.04,1.0,2.0,That's also a question.
36291,PS6,3,238.24,239.16,0.92,2.0,I think the more the better.
36291,PS6,3,239.16,255.6,16.44,2.0,"I think if people are going to come to like, a communal shower which has karaoke fitted in it, they can sing for good health and also like experience the just just like health for that."
36291,PS6,3,256.76,257.4,0.64,2.0,What do you think?
36291,PS6,3,259.24,261.24,2.0,1.0,I do think it's kind of similar to Carl.
36291,PS6,3,261.8,263.2,1.4,2.0,"Yeah, it is, yeah."
36291,PS6,3,263.2,267.0,3.8,2.0,With I think we can just be like violation.
36291,PS6,3,267.0,269.48,2.48,2.0,"But I think no, actually this is much better because."
36291,PS6,3,269.56,270.08,0.52,1.0,I do think so.
36291,PS6,3,270.08,272.8,2.72,2.0,Because people would anyway not want to sing in their showers.
36291,PS6,3,272.8,274.24,1.44,2.0,We're just trying to get that done.
36291,PS6,3,274.96,275.64,0.68,2.0,Do you?
36291,PS6,3,275.64,276.88,1.24,2.0,"Are you, are you a bathroom singer?"

36291,PS6,3,292.6,293.08,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, I think."
36291,PS6,3,293.84,295.12,1.28,1.0,I can't think of any better idea.
36291,PS6,3,295.16,307.2,12.04,2.0,"Than maybe I think what would also help to have is a is a lyric screen while you take shower because like you might not sing because you're just like, I don't remember that song."
36291,PS6,3,308.16,309.56,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, we add to the like."
36291,PS6,3,309.68,311.56,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, have a karaoke shower."
36291,PS6,3,311.92,313.64,1.72,2.0,Have a shower with a karaoke device.
36291,PS6,3,313.64,315.12,1.48,2.0,I think that's what we should write with.
36291,PS6,3,316.04,316.32,0.28,1.0,Karaoke.
36291,PS6,3,316.68,321.4,4.72,2.0,Device with OK device.
36291,PS6,3,322.2,322.96,0.76,1.0,And maybe do some.
36291,PS6,3,323.84,326.56,2.72,2.0,"Fitted in their bathrooms, I."
36291,PS6,3,326.6,328.48,1.88,1.0,"Don't know, do you sound like auto dictation?"
36291,PS6,3,328.48,333.08,4.6,1.0,"Like when you play this song, do you detect people sing and then collect that data and?"
36291,PS6,3,333.52,335.68,2.16,2.0,"I don't, no, I don't think anybody is going to agree."
36291,PS6,3,335.68,338.4,2.72,2.0,I will not agree to anybody collecting my data while I'm in a shower.
36291,PS6,3,338.96,341.88,2.92,2.0,Like that's that's invasion of privacy for me.
36291,PS6,3,342.12,350.36,8.24,2.0,"No, but like, I think the doctors could have it in their reports be like, how many times did you sing in your shower this week?"
36291,PS6,3,351.08,356.16,5.08,2.0,Or like whenever you meet your you're like whoever is your doctor or something.
36291,PS6,3,356.24,356.56,0.32,2.0,Oh yeah.
36291,PS6,3,356.6,360.96,4.36,2.0,I think we could add that as an idea where like have it in your medical practice.
36291,PS6,3,360.96,365.0,4.04,2.0,If like doctors can check for how many times did you sing in sing in your shower.
36291,PS6,3,368.8,370.68,1.88,2.0,"OK, OK."
36291,PS6,3,370.96,375.56,4.6,2.0,That bathroom medically sing we don't need this part.
36291,PS6,3,375.56,405.96,30.4,2.0,"So idea 3 have this have the singing in the shar factor as an indicator in your medical report, in your medical medical report or medical survey."
36291,PS6,3,406.88,407.92,1.04,2.0,Medical survey.
36291,PS6,3,411.08,420.19,9.11,2.0,"OK, so which idea are we going for though?"
36291,PS6,3,421.51,423.51,2.0,2.0,Do we want to generate more or is this enough?
36291,PS6,3,423.51,426.47,2.96,2.0,"Or like, are there more creative ideas that we can think of with do you like?"
36291,PS6,3,426.99,427.31,0.32,1.0,Idea one.
36291,PS6,3,429.8,430.8,1.0,2.0,"The karaoke, right."
36291,PS6,3,430.8,433.92,3.12,2.0,"Like, that will make a party at least, if not every day."
36291,PS6,3,433.92,438.04,4.12,2.0,I would be singing at least twice in my shower with that karaoke.
36291,PS6,3,440.2,443.44,3.24,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36291,PS6,3,443.44,446.36,2.92,2.0,"I don't think, like, I'm a very shy singer."
36291,PS6,3,446.36,447.48,1.12,2.0,I'm not a singer at all.
36291,PS6,3,448.08,450.64,2.56,2.0,"So, like, I will not ever sing in public."
36291,PS6,3,451.32,453.72,2.4,2.0,I would rather sing in the shower with the karaoke.
36291,PS6,3,453.72,454.0,0.28,2.0,That's true.
36291,PS6,3,455.12,456.92,1.8,2.0,So shall we go for idea one?
36291,PS6,3,456.92,457.04,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36291,PS6,3,457.8,458.16,0.36,2.0,OK.
36291,PS6,3,458.2,461.0,2.8,2.0,Final idea one.
36291,PS6,3,461.0,461.12,0.12,2.0,Cool.
36291,PS6,3,462.84,463.16,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
36291,PS6,3,464.36,464.96,0.6,2.0,Next.
36291,PS6,3,464.96,465.16,0.2,2.0,Next.
35474,PS2,6,10.96,11.68,0.72,1.0,Maybe you're good at.
35474,PS2,6,18.2,19.68,1.48,2.0,Just pile up more stock.
35474,PS2,6,20.04,22.8,2.76,3.0,"I think that's the most direct way, not the least."
35474,PS2,6,29.8,31.8,2.0,4.0,I have one clear about vulnerability.
35474,PS2,6,31.8,33.52,1.72,4.0,"What's Kyle vulnerability, do you know?"
35474,PS2,6,34.0,37.2,3.2,1.0,Vulnerability is like a bad things like.
35474,PS2,6,37.52,38.04,0.52,4.0,Bad thing.
35474,PS2,6,38.24,40.92,2.68,5.0,Vulnerabilities means like easy to fluctuate it Oh.
35474,PS2,6,41.16,41.96,0.8,4.0,Fluctuate demand.
35474,PS2,6,42.28,45.76,3.48,5.0,Whether maybe higher demand or lower demand.
35474,PS2,6,47.56,56.0,8.44,5.0,"So let's say for example, the like a low fish for the sushi, you know raw fish of the expiry date is not so wrong, right?"
35474,PS2,6,56.4,61.76,5.36,5.0,So you know the producer need to focusing on the exact amount of supply and demand.
35474,PS2,6,62.12,66.16,4.04,5.0,"But if they missed, you know many of the raw fish going to be crops."
35474,PS2,6,66.64,67.44,0.8,5.0,So this is.
35474,PS2,6,69.04,70.68,1.64,4.0,So it's like a fluctuation.
35474,PS2,6,72.84,74.2,1.36,6.0,"So it's depend on the product, right?"
35474,PS2,6,74.2,74.68,0.48,6.0,For example.
35474,PS2,6,74.92,76.88,1.96,5.0,Let's say break a desk.
35474,PS2,6,77.88,80.44,2.56,5.0,"There is no expiry date, so we can stop."
35474,PS2,6,81.08,81.6,0.52,1.0,No inventory.
35474,PS2,6,81.6,89.0,7.4,5.0,"Or something, but for that it's impossible, so it's the better for the product A."
35474,PS2,6,91.56,92.48,0.92,2.0,Better a better.
35474,PS2,6,92.76,94.88,2.12,3.0,A better forecast of demand.
35474,PS2,6,95.28,95.88,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,96.8,96.96,0.16,2.0,That's.
35474,PS2,6,97.32,102.16,4.84,1.0,That's that's I I think AI can.
35474,PS2,6,102.32,104.52,2.2,2.0,Do some real time estimate.
35474,PS2,6,104.72,107.12,2.4,1.0,And forecasting like the big data.
35474,PS2,6,107.32,107.52,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,107.52,109.0,1.48,2.0,So you you speak data?
35474,PS2,6,109.16,109.36,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,111.68,113.8,2.12,1.0,"So I know like Australia, we had."
35474,PS2,6,114.68,117.24,2.56,2.0,I was on a project that we use digital twins.
35474,PS2,6,117.96,131.64,13.68,1.0,"To basically track in real life all the traffic and then basically integrate all the traffic from the, from the sea, from the lens, from the roads to the airplanes."
35474,PS2,6,131.88,136.08,4.2,1.0,So say for example if there is a traffic on the.
35474,PS2,6,136.08,136.44,0.36,2.0,Rd.
35474,PS2,6,136.68,137.6,0.92,1.0,People got the way.
35474,PS2,6,137.6,139.2,1.6,2.0,To enter to airport.
35474,PS2,6,139.44,143.24,3.8,1.0,So they can reschedule the airplane's schedule to to fit.
35474,PS2,6,143.72,149.16,5.44,1.0,So it's kind of like integrate and then use the whole data to estimate the future forecast.
35474,PS2,6,149.8,153.76,3.96,2.0,Or maybe that's something we can do so.
35474,PS2,6,153.76,154.36,0.6,1.0,Look at the.
35474,PS2,6,154.36,155.52,1.16,2.0,Whole economic.
35474,PS2,6,155.52,164.36,8.84,1.0,"Yes, someone can monitor and then get look at the customer behaviours, you know to to ask them to forecast."
35474,PS2,6,164.6,166.0,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35474,PS2,6,166.52,167.56,1.04,2.0,But I don't know how to.
35474,PS2,6,168.92,169.16,0.24,1.0,Put in.
35474,PS2,6,169.44,169.8,0.36,2.0,Words.
35474,PS2,6,172.2,177.84,5.64,4.0,It can be adapt and apply the strategy right to to handle with with the fluctuation.
35474,PS2,6,178.28,179.04,0.76,4.0,Something like that.
35474,PS2,6,179.76,182.0,2.24,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35474,PS2,6,193.24,194.48,1.24,1.0,"In your case, how?"
35474,PS2,6,194.8,197.88,3.08,1.0,How can they get this data like?
35474,PS2,6,198.12,198.32,0.2,2.0,This.
35474,PS2,6,198.32,198.64,0.32,1.0,Piece.
35474,PS2,6,199.0,199.72,0.72,2.0,Like mobile?
35474,PS2,6,200.8,202.52,1.72,1.0,Is a lot ETV.
35474,PS2,6,202.52,204.0,1.48,2.0,Or I don't.
35474,PS2,6,204.12,207.48,3.36,1.0,"Know in Australia it was like, yeah, look."
35474,PS2,6,207.48,207.6,0.12,4.0,At.
35474,PS2,6,209.68,210.56,0.88,1.0,That project was in.
35474,PS2,6,210.64,212.56,1.92,2.0,"Australia, so they look at."
35474,PS2,6,212.68,213.68,1.0,3.0,The ACTV.
35474,PS2,6,213.68,214.88,1.2,1.0,The traffic traffic.
35474,PS2,6,215.04,216.8,1.76,2.0,"Sings on the sea, on the roads."
35474,PS2,6,216.92,218.44,1.52,2.0,"OK, well."
35474,PS2,6,219.28,221.0,1.72,1.0,So maybe here we can put more.
35474,PS2,6,221.6,222.16,0.56,1.0,I'm just.
35474,PS2,6,222.24,222.68,0.44,2.0,Thinking.
35474,PS2,6,224.72,230.44,5.72,1.0,They can probably look at the customer behavior in their day-to-day life.
35474,PS2,6,230.44,231.24,0.8,2.0,From like.
35474,PS2,6,231.68,232.56,0.88,1.0,When they're shopping.
35474,PS2,6,232.56,235.04,2.48,2.0,Grocery when they are working.
35474,PS2,6,238.24,244.96,6.72,1.0,In the season I think like maybe some pick some of the stuff are seasonal dependence.
35474,PS2,6,245.12,246.92,1.8,2.0,So like and then.
35474,PS2,6,247.52,247.88,0.36,1.0,Any kind of.
35474,PS2,6,247.88,249.24,1.36,2.0,That history and also maybe do.
35474,PS2,6,249.28,254.04,4.76,3.0,Some regression analysis identifying some regressors.
35474,PS2,6,255.04,255.24,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,255.88,258.76,2.88,3.0,But I think it's all falls under the umbrella of data analysis.
35474,PS2,6,259.08,259.92,0.84,2.0,"Yeah, data analysis."
35474,PS2,6,260.08,260.44,0.36,4.0,"Yeah, I think."
35474,PS2,6,261.36,261.96,0.6,3.0,It's I don't think we.
35474,PS2,6,262.32,264.52,2.2,1.0,Should I think we just like list bullet point on?
35474,PS2,6,264.52,269.72,5.2,1.0,"For example, we can analyze customer behavior, just don't don't have to call."
35474,PS2,6,269.76,270.08,0.32,2.0,Like at.
35474,PS2,6,270.92,275.12,4.2,1.0,The same time we can manage some trends like by marketing or like for.
35474,PS2,6,277.16,277.48,0.32,5.0,Example.
35474,PS2,6,280.16,280.48,0.32,2.0,Any other?
35474,PS2,6,281.36,281.64,0.28,5.0,Idea.
35474,PS2,6,283.0,284.08,1.08,3.0,Just about the forecast of.
35474,PS2,6,288.2,288.44,0.24,6.0,Demand.
35474,PS2,6,288.48,289.88,1.4,6.0,Perhaps we need to also take a.
35474,PS2,6,290.08,293.68,3.6,5.0,"Solution about the external talk to, such as whether."
35474,PS2,6,294.52,294.92,0.4,4.0,Through or like.
35474,PS2,6,296.36,296.8,0.44,5.0,What's not?
35474,PS2,6,299.4,300.32,0.92,1.0,Whether?
35474,PS2,6,300.68,301.92,1.24,2.0,I think a long thing can impact.
35474,PS2,6,303.52,303.76,0.24,1.0,Because.
35474,PS2,6,303.76,305.36,1.6,2.0,It it's really broad like this.
35474,PS2,6,305.48,306.0,0.52,1.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,306.16,307.08,0.92,2.0,Definitely questions.
35474,PS2,6,308.08,308.28,0.2,1.0,Are the.
35474,PS2,6,308.28,310.08,1.8,2.0,Economic could be impact.
35474,PS2,6,310.08,310.8,0.72,3.0,Their work.
35474,PS2,6,311.36,313.36,2.0,2.0,And then the work could impact how much.
35474,PS2,6,313.56,320.68,7.12,1.0,The money they want to spend on certain items as well and the temperature can impact people things.
35474,PS2,6,320.84,321.76,0.92,2.0,People want to buy.
35474,PS2,6,322.48,322.88,0.4,1.0,The.
35474,PS2,6,325.04,325.68,0.64,2.0,Specific of.
35474,PS2,6,325.68,326.64,0.96,1.0,Patients like.
35474,PS2,6,326.88,331.72,4.84,2.0,Basketball can you help on people when I buy us So what else?
35474,PS2,6,332.48,334.2,1.72,6.0,"I know this is kind of tricky, but."
35474,PS2,6,334.72,336.52,1.8,5.0,You know obviously that it is not.
35474,PS2,6,336.72,339.88,3.16,5.0,It is impossible to reduce 100% of the.
35474,PS2,6,340.36,341.0,0.64,6.0,Part abilities.
35474,PS2,6,341.08,341.2,0.12,1.0,Right.
35474,PS2,6,341.24,341.36,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,341.84,343.6,1.76,5.0,So how about the cover up insurance or.
35474,PS2,6,344.48,344.96,0.48,4.0,Insurance.
35474,PS2,6,345.52,346.4,0.88,1.0,Sounds creative.
35474,PS2,6,346.4,346.84,0.44,1.0,Very creative.
35474,PS2,6,349.36,357.84,8.48,5.0,"So let's say if you have an uncontrolled cost and insufficient or something, something called negative effect for the economy, but we can cover."
35474,PS2,6,359.8,366.84,7.04,1.0,Up the insurance but like from point of insurance company it's hard to start this kind.
35474,PS2,6,367.24,370.88,3.64,5.0,"But insurance company also need to get, you know, let's say like a premium."
35474,PS2,6,372.24,373.48,1.24,5.0,It's completely same.
35474,PS2,6,373.92,374.32,0.4,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35474,PS2,6,375.16,376.0,0.84,5.0,The other.

35474,PS2,6,380.32,382.24,1.92,5.0,I don't think it's happened.
35474,PS2,6,383.36,388.56,5.2,5.0,"So maybe you know, they just company kind of all this business."
35474,PS2,6,389.28,394.84,5.56,3.0,"Well, we need to go there and data analysis, but I think this is a good idea and."
35474,PS2,6,394.88,396.16,1.28,5.0,Then it would be great to show.
35474,PS2,6,396.88,396.96,0.08,4.0,You.
35474,PS2,6,396.96,398.68,1.72,4.0,"Yeah, it's, it's more creative, Yeah."
35474,PS2,6,399.2,403.36,4.16,1.0,Just like I think we can start with just insurance.
35474,PS2,6,403.64,403.76,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35474,PS2,6,404.28,408.44,4.16,4.0,"We have to cut backs, keep backs at it."

35474,PS2,6,515.04,517.24,2.2,1.0,Estimate it correctly if it's.
35474,PS2,6,517.24,519.04,1.8,2.0,From the government label.
35474,PS2,6,519.68,520.84,1.16,1.0,So maybe they should have.
35474,PS2,6,520.92,521.6,0.68,1.0,They should form the.
35474,PS2,6,521.6,523.2,1.6,2.0,Partnership with governments.

35282,PS1,6,346.16,348.92,2.76,5.0,Existing plastic even more more stable.
35282,PS1,6,349.24,352.64,3.4,2.0,"Yes, it could be like a punishment for how much plastic we have used."
35282,PS1,6,352.84,353.4,0.56,2.0,Brilliant.
35282,PS1,6,355.52,367.2,11.68,2.0,So make out of existing plastic to show punishment for a map that has been used.

35420,PS1,6,206.8,207.16,0.36,5.0,It's done.
35420,PS1,6,207.16,208.16,1.0,5.0,There's still ideas.
35420,PS1,6,210.32,213.96,3.64,6.0,How about these for homes and offices?
35420,PS1,6,214.64,214.92,0.28,5.0,Yes.
35420,PS1,6,215.08,216.8,1.72,6.0,I'm sure this is actually from plastic.
35420,PS1,6,218.04,221.32,3.28,1.0,Could be you know that the the outer surface and then.
35420,PS1,6,222.44,224.76,2.32,5.0,"The recycled fibre inside, right?"
35420,PS1,6,228.84,230.6,1.76,6.0,So the big idea is recycling.
35420,PS1,6,230.68,231.28,0.6,6.0,Is that what?
35420,PS1,6,233.16,235.2,2.04,2.0,So you've got to be small to get to Cambridge.
35420,PS1,6,235.28,235.8,0.52,5.0,I'm sure.
35420,PS1,6,238.8,239.08,0.28,3.0,You can.
35420,PS1,6,243.0,246.04,3.04,6.0,Tell the first point to collect all plastic.
35420,PS1,6,246.28,248.96,2.68,6.0,"Oh yeah, I was going to say, like, what do you do the plastic?"
35420,PS1,6,248.96,251.36,2.4,4.0,"Yeah, we're melting it down to down boots and flicks."
35420,PS1,6,252.32,253.0,0.68,6.0,Added that to it.
35420,PS1,6,272.0,274.76,2.76,5.0,"Yeah, make into fibers to weave."
35420,PS1,6,274.76,280.76,6.0,6.0,"Stuff out of I mean, yeah, I, I mean, they combined the claims because I still swim swimwear."
35420,PS1,6,280.76,281.48,0.72,5.0,Shirts from.
35420,PS1,6,282.12,282.72,0.6,6.0,Glasses.
35420,PS1,6,282.96,283.28,0.32,5.0,Yeah.
35420,PS1,6,283.84,285.12,1.28,1.0,Most of what we're wearing is.
35420,PS1,6,285.88,286.24,0.36,5.0,Yeah.
35420,PS1,6,287.16,291.28,4.12,6.0,So so you you cannot propose the idea since it's being done.
35420,PS1,6,291.48,294.52,3.04,1.0,"Yeah, I mean, I don't know how much we cannot post ideas."
35420,PS1,6,294.52,294.92,0.4,5.0,Because.
35420,PS1,6,295.84,298.44,2.6,1.0,Well that that have already been done as well.
35420,PS1,6,299.12,302.56,3.44,1.0,I thought AI is just going to put them to pick them.
35420,PS1,6,303.36,306.2,2.84,5.0,"Yeah, here's some different recycling methods will be."
35420,PS1,6,306.36,308.32,1.96,5.0,I assume AI is this is.
35420,PS1,6,309.12,310.88,1.76,3.0,"OK, up cycling actually, rather than."
35420,PS1,6,311.4,312.08,0.68,6.0,Recycling.
35420,PS1,6,314.72,318.16,3.44,6.0,How about to make it more effective than building?
35420,PS1,6,318.52,319.16,0.64,5.0,Roads and.
35420,PS1,6,319.56,323.8,4.24,6.0,Brakes is such that you cannot build your house with any other thing else.
35420,PS1,6,324.28,327.88,3.6,6.0,Like just like have a legislation that forbids any other thing else.
35420,PS1,6,327.88,331.56,3.68,6.0,"So that more and more people did their house out of bricks, I mean plastic bricks."
35420,PS1,6,331.56,336.28,4.72,6.0,So it's taking off the system.
35420,PS1,6,337.36,350.76,13.4,2.0,Could you also like make it more difficult to use like newly created plastic in production to like make that like you could heavily like tax that and so you have to use.
35420,PS1,6,353.0,357.72,4.72,6.0,"Yeah, yeah, I like that because I mean, we usually focus only on the plastic when it's already existed."
35420,PS1,6,357.76,358.36,0.6,3.0,With one.
35420,PS1,6,358.88,360.0,1.12,6.0,"Fuel, Fuel."
35420,PS1,6,360.0,372.68,12.68,3.0,Research into bio not sustainable but more biodegradable plastics so that way it's less of a persistent threat in the environment.
35420,PS1,6,373.2,374.96,1.76,6.0,"Yeah, grass roots elimination."
35420,PS1,6,376.4,379.84,3.44,5.0,But isn't the whole thing about plastic is that it's a by?
35420,PS1,6,379.84,380.48,0.64,6.0,Product.
35420,PS1,6,381.0,382.96,1.96,5.0,Of oil.
35420,PS1,6,383.64,388.84,5.2,3.0,"It's not a byproduct really, it is made from an ear."
35420,PS1,6,389.12,389.4,0.28,5.0,Yeah.
35420,PS1,6,389.4,392.24,2.84,5.0,But it's because it's a different length polymer.
35420,PS1,6,392.24,393.4,1.16,5.0,So it's like a biper.
35420,PS1,6,393.4,396.72,3.32,5.0,It's like what's leftover when you take the stuff that you actually want to use as full fuel.
35420,PS1,6,396.92,406.8,9.88,5.0,"So if you just research more sustainable fuel and that was replacing oil drilling, then you would by proxy not be making the plastic."
35420,PS1,6,407.44,408.56,1.12,2.0,Who here does a science?
35420,PS1,6,408.56,409.32,0.76,2.0,Space debris.
35420,PS1,6,410.08,410.8,0.72,3.0,I'm a chemist.
35420,PS1,6,412.4,414.16,1.76,1.0,"Engineering Department, Commerce."
35420,PS1,6,414.64,414.92,0.28,4.0,Yeah.
35420,PS1,6,415.84,417.6,1.76,4.0,"I mean, I do medicine, so it's not really."
35420,PS1,6,420.8,421.36,0.56,1.0,How about?
35420,PS1,6,421.76,425.28,3.52,3.0,I I wouldn't qualify plastic as a by product of the industry.
35420,PS1,6,425.32,437.28,11.96,3.0,"I think it's actually one of the, the, the chemicals industry that comes out of the oil industry is one of the demands of oil exploration and."
35420,PS1,6,437.32,441.48,4.16,6.0,Recovery so plastics didn't come out as a as a waste from.
35420,PS1,6,441.52,442.4,0.88,3.0,Not a waste.
35420,PS1,6,442.56,443.28,0.72,3.0,Not a waste.
35420,PS1,6,443.48,444.88,1.4,3.0,It's a primary target for.
35420,PS1,6,445.04,445.24,0.2,5.0,Some.
35420,PS1,6,445.6,446.04,0.44,6.0,Companies but.
35420,PS1,6,446.2,452.24,6.04,5.0,It doesn't like initially it wasn't like people went to to prospect for oil so they could make plastic.
35420,PS1,6,452.28,459.04,6.76,5.0,"It was like people went to Prospect for oil for fuel, and then they were like, hey, we can make plastic out of the stuff we're not earning."
35420,PS1,6,460.04,463.04,3.0,6.0,And then they put their attention on making more of the plastics.
35420,PS1,6,465.64,466.28,0.64,1.0,How about?
35420,PS1,6,466.76,473.88,7.12,5.0,And I don't think that the like financial gain of plastic would justify oil drilling if it was just for plastic.
35420,PS1,6,475.76,477.24,1.48,5.0,"So if you had this, it is."
35420,PS1,6,477.24,480.4,3.16,3.0,One of the top 3 industries in the world right now.
35420,PS1,6,481.44,482.92,1.48,3.0,"Yeah, one of the top three chemical."
35420,PS1,6,482.92,483.56,0.64,5.0,Industries.
35420,PS1,6,483.56,484.64,1.08,6.0,"I mean, look at that."
35420,PS1,6,486.0,487.88,1.88,2.0,"Yeah, it's not really surprising anything."
35420,PS1,6,487.88,488.08,0.2,3.0,But.
35420,PS1,6,489.56,494.76,5.2,1.0,How about we compress it and send it to space and build like a Barbie London moon?
35420,PS1,6,498.24,505.24,7.0,1.0,"No, but honestly if you can compress it, it would be easier potentially to send it away."
35420,PS1,6,506.84,507.76,0.92,6.0,So where does it go?
35420,PS1,6,507.84,508.32,0.48,6.0,Is this?
35420,PS1,6,508.32,509.72,1.4,6.0,Is it just?
35420,PS1,6,509.72,513.08,3.36,1.0,"Barbie ones on Mars, like Mars."
35420,PS1,6,513.16,516.8,3.64,1.0,"If we ever colonize, it's probably going to be made out of pasta, isn't it?"
35420,PS1,6,521.08,522.48,1.4,6.0,The sci-fi is coming up.
35420,PS1,6,523.6,523.96,0.36,1.0,Yeah.
35420,PS1,6,529.2,529.6,0.4,6.0,I think.
35420,PS1,6,529.72,530.24,0.52,2.0,It is.
35420,PS1,6,534.76,536.72,1.96,1.0,"OK, we have 3 minutes left."
35420,PS1,6,553.96,554.28,0.32,2.0,Right.
35420,PS1,6,554.4,558.32,3.92,3.0,I think the energy used to send it to space would probably negate and.
35420,PS1,6,559.16,561.64,2.48,4.0,"Yeah, hey, we're just reducing plastic pollution."
35420,PS1,6,561.64,563.16,1.52,4.0,We don't care about other pollution.
35420,PS1,6,563.36,564.28,0.92,3.0,By consuming.
35420,PS1,6,564.6,565.08,0.48,6.0,More.
35420,PS1,6,565.16,565.68,0.52,3.0,"Oil, probably."
35420,PS1,6,569.24,572.52,3.28,1.0,Well then send it to down down to the earth.
35420,PS1,6,573.16,578.0,4.84,3.0,Burying leachate into the environment would probably be.
35420,PS1,6,578.36,579.28,0.92,2.0,Done what?
35420,PS1,6,580.16,581.8,1.64,2.0,I reckon we should start.
35420,PS1,6,582.36,583.84,1.48,3.0,"Yeah, this is this is fine."
35420,PS1,6,583.84,584.2,0.36,3.0,Let's.
35420,PS1,6,596.43,600.99,4.56,2.0,"I mean, melt it all down, build roads and bricks and stuff is is very good."
35420,PS1,6,601.03,604.51,3.48,2.0,"But if it's already been done, is that a reason?"
35420,PS1,6,606.15,608.87,2.72,2.0,"But mind you, I guess a lot of these things have already been done, so maybe that's I."
35420,PS1,6,610.39,613.43,3.04,5.0,Think the legislation in Texas is good?
35420,PS1,6,614.03,615.15,1.12,6.0,And they buy the degradable roads.
35420,PS1,6,615.19,617.39,2.2,6.0,Just it.
35420,PS1,6,628.16,630.32,2.16,2.0,I have no idea what the nickel and copper one is.
35420,PS1,6,631.36,632.68,1.32,2.0,Trust you guys to make a.
35420,PS1,6,632.68,633.16,0.48,3.0,Decision on that.
35420,PS1,6,633.16,634.48,1.32,3.0,I'm not sure what it is either.
35420,PS1,6,634.64,634.88,0.24,3.0,What?
35420,PS1,6,634.96,635.96,1.0,3.0,What exactly is it?
35420,PS1,6,636.64,650.72,14.08,5.0,"Well if you get nickel popper leads and zinc one other metal, they are attractive to different polymer lengths so you can use them so you collect micro plastics."
35420,PS1,6,652.2,654.2,2.0,3.0,"I have some microblastics, OK."
35420,PS1,6,659.16,659.32,0.16,2.0,Right.
35420,PS1,6,660.24,661.28,1.04,6.0,Nickel and copper and.
35420,PS1,6,663.92,665.16,1.24,4.0,"Well, it's all."
35420,PS1,6,665.6,665.8,0.2,5.0,So.
35420,PS1,6,666.44,666.88,0.44,2.0,What are we?
35420,PS1,6,667.32,667.72,0.4,5.0,Thinking we.
35420,PS1,6,669.72,670.44,0.72,1.0,Have 50 seconds.
35420,PS1,6,671.36,675.6,4.24,2.0,"Maybe we can describe it, the whole process, like you collected the plastic."
35420,PS1,6,675.88,677.44,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, you melt it all down."
35420,PS1,6,678.28,678.44,0.16,1.0,Yeah.
35420,PS1,6,680.8,683.2,2.4,2.0,Then the legislation probably is a separate idea.
35420,PS1,6,683.6,684.48,0.88,5.0,I think that fits.
35420,PS1,6,684.48,684.64,0.16,1.0,In.
35420,PS1,6,685.0,685.64,0.64,5.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35420,PS1,6,685.64,687.32,1.68,5.0,That's like a process you can to.
35420,PS1,6,687.32,688.44,1.12,3.0,Build infrastructure and.
35420,PS1,6,689.32,693.16,3.84,5.0,Then you create legislation around it that's like A1 plan.
35420,PS1,6,693.68,694.36,0.68,2.0,"Cool, cool, cool."
35420,PS1,6,713.44,714.48,1.04,3.0,Right next.
35042,PS5,3,1.84,7.2,5.36,1.0,Voluntary nutrition have employees as we have already resulting in the reduction of value telling the refers.
35042,PS5,3,7.2,12.12,4.92,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to stop voluntary employee attrition.
35042,PS5,3,12.88,13.88,1.0,1.0,Chain them to their desk.
35042,PS5,3,14.04,14.64,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, fine."
35042,PS5,3,16.16,17.8,1.64,2.0,"Yeah, I mean creatively."
35042,PS5,3,17.8,18.12,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35042,PS5,3,18.96,19.4,0.44,2.0,What else?
35042,PS5,3,26.4,30.16,3.76,1.0,I guess what companies do now is they set up a set of benefits.
35042,PS5,3,30.48,31.04,0.56,2.0,"Yeah, you."
35042,PS5,3,31.12,33.76,2.64,1.0,Won't leave like they'll try to make it really nice.
35042,PS5,3,33.76,37.48,3.72,2.0,"It's like above offer above market pay, but it's not that it's like."
35042,PS5,3,37.6,41.52,3.92,1.0,"Have a flexible working environment, hybrid, yeah, flexible hours."
35042,PS5,3,41.52,44.96,3.44,1.0,"Like I think, I think that's what what companies do now."
35042,PS5,3,45.16,47.32,2.16,1.0,But if we had to come up with a creative idea.
35042,PS5,3,48.24,49.68,1.44,2.0,"Yeah, those are the main things."
35042,PS5,3,51.44,52.88,1.44,2.0,Maybe maybe you know what should do.
35042,PS5,3,52.88,54.84,1.96,2.0,A company should just be like you can work whenever you want.
35042,PS5,3,56.4,56.96,0.56,1.0,Yeah.
35042,PS5,3,58.32,59.72,1.4,2.0,And that way people won't really leave.
35042,PS5,3,59.92,60.28,0.36,2.0,Or maybe.
35042,PS5,3,60.28,62.04,1.76,1.0,I would say they they leave the company.
35042,PS5,3,62.08,62.72,0.64,1.0,"OK, they leave."
35042,PS5,3,62.72,65.36,2.64,1.0,"The company presumably set a bet for a better offer, right?"
35042,PS5,3,65.84,70.04,4.2,2.0,"Or sometimes like they have a kid, or sometimes they they just don't want to work anymore."
35042,PS5,3,70.04,72.08,2.04,2.0,It's that they've lost interest.
35042,PS5,3,72.08,72.96,0.88,2.0,They don't like the team.
35042,PS5,3,72.96,73.44,0.48,2.0,There's many.
35042,PS5,3,73.44,73.76,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, it's."
35042,PS5,3,73.92,74.32,0.4,3.0,Hard to know.
35042,PS5,3,76.04,80.56,4.52,1.0,Maybe we could have like an app within the coming up with like a creative idea.
35042,PS5,3,82.68,95.16,12.48,1.0,You would have like some sort of platform where you could say like I want to leave the company and then it offers you to match you to a different if you have to state the reason.
35042,PS5,3,95.16,102.36,7.2,1.0,"And if it's like you're paying for another job, they try to match you to a better job within the company and it's like a matchmaking service."
35042,PS5,3,102.84,103.4,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, I like that."
35042,PS5,3,103.4,103.56,0.16,3.0,That's.
35042,PS5,3,103.8,105.04,1.24,2.0,"The current one, like Tinder."
35042,PS5,3,105.4,110.6,5.2,1.0,"Yeah, like a Tinder for you to match with the job, the perfect job for you within the same company, so you don't leave."
35042,PS5,3,110.92,112.12,1.2,2.0,Wait for FYI wants to leave.
35042,PS5,3,112.32,114.36,2.04,3.0,A little bit further on the problem.
35042,PS5,3,114.8,118.88,4.08,3.0,But you want to stop voluntary attrition because it reduces value.
35042,PS5,3,119.4,124.64,5.24,3.0,"So what if we don't stop voluntary attrition, but we stop the value?"
35042,PS5,3,124.64,125.76,1.12,3.0,Redirect the reduction.
35042,PS5,3,125.8,127.92,2.12,3.0,So if you want to leave voluntary.
35042,PS5,3,128.04,128.52,0.48,1.0,You have to.
35042,PS5,3,129.4,130.16,0.76,3.0,Assign someone else.
35042,PS5,3,130.56,130.88,0.32,1.0,And I'll.
35042,PS5,3,130.96,133.48,2.52,3.0,Give you and I'll give you a bonus for that because I'm.
35042,PS5,3,133.48,133.92,0.44,2.0,"OK, OK."
35042,PS5,3,134.24,135.96,1.72,1.0,That could be the second part of the platform.
35042,PS5,3,135.96,142.52,6.56,1.0,"So if you still want to leave, if we match you to a good offer but you still want to leave, we offer you a bonus."
35042,PS5,3,142.96,149.36,6.4,1.0,The opposite of assigning bonus a leaving bonus if you can fill your spot with someone as talented as you.
35042,PS5,3,150.32,152.16,1.84,2.0,"Correct, but but, but but how?"
35042,PS5,3,152.2,152.48,0.28,2.0,How?
35042,PS5,3,152.48,153.44,0.96,2.0,How would you measure that?
35042,PS5,3,153.6,157.2,3.6,1.0,After you only pay the bonus after two or after the probation.
35042,PS5,3,157.2,158.2,1.0,2.0,"Yeah, a good person."
35042,PS5,3,158.56,165.28,6.72,1.0,"So when the probation period has passed, if this person is good, then they pay you your bonus."
35042,PS5,3,165.44,175.72,10.28,1.0,"I think actually that exists, like, not for when you leave, but some companies have schemes where they will pay you to refer someone, and if they're good and they're meeting their targets, you get paid."
35042,PS5,3,176.0,177.56,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, some companies have not."
35042,PS5,3,177.96,181.36,3.4,1.0,"So this could be like that, but for when you're leaving and you need a replacement."
35042,PS5,3,182.92,184.88,1.96,3.0,So now we can stop voluntary.
35042,PS5,3,186.24,186.84,0.6,1.0,Nutrition.
35042,PS5,3,187.16,187.92,0.76,3.0,Because for the.
35042,PS5,3,187.96,189.8,1.84,1.0,First time in the first iteration.
35042,PS5,3,189.8,192.0,2.2,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35042,PS5,3,192.0,197.12,5.12,3.0,"And then if you want to leave, we'll stop the reduction of values happening."
35042,PS5,3,197.44,197.52,0.08,3.0,Uh huh.
35042,PS5,3,199.32,202.04,2.72,3.0,Stop voluntary leave.
35042,PS5,3,202.04,203.96,1.92,3.0,How do you stop somebody from leaving it?
35042,PS5,3,205.04,206.16,1.12,1.0,It's changing them to the.
35042,PS5,3,209.48,218.0,8.52,3.0,Desks cheating them for to change the you really can remember making them forget.
35042,PS5,3,218.6,220.44,1.84,1.0,"Making them forget, yeah, you watched."
35042,PS5,3,220.44,221.48,1.04,1.0,"No, you haven't seen several."
35042,PS5,3,221.48,222.08,0.6,2.0,"No, but you were."
35042,PS5,3,222.08,222.44,0.36,3.0,Talking about.
35042,PS5,3,222.44,222.8,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, you don't."
35042,PS5,3,224.28,224.72,0.44,3.0,Remember Me?
35042,PS5,3,224.76,226.96,2.2,1.0,My my office reminds me of several.
35042,PS5,3,228.0,228.2,0.2,3.0,Really.
35042,PS5,3,228.96,236.44,7.48,1.0,I told them that's really weird.
35042,PS5,3,237.0,240.24,3.24,1.0,"Yeah, they get paid of months."
35042,PS5,3,240.68,241.16,0.48,1.0,There you go.
35042,PS5,3,241.24,246.84,5.6,1.0,And then maybe there's a scheme you can still access the platform after you've left.
35042,PS5,3,246.84,257.2,10.36,1.0,"So if you want to come back because you're valued talent, if you want to come back, the doors always open and you can go back to this marketplace, which is exclusively for employees and ex employees."
35042,PS5,3,257.88,262.32,4.44,1.0,And you can just match with any role you want and you can go back.
35042,PS5,3,263.2,265.76,2.56,1.0,"Maybe not any role, any role that matches your skills."
35042,PS5,3,266.08,270.04,3.96,1.0,"Yeah, maybe it's like if there's a programmer and you don't know how to program."
35042,PS5,3,270.28,271.04,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, correct."
35042,PS5,3,273.16,273.84,0.68,1.0,"Cool, great, I."
35042,PS5,3,274.76,275.28,0.52,2.0,Think that's good?
35042,PS5,3,275.4,275.96,0.56,1.0,Great idea.
35042,PS5,3,276.68,277.28,0.6,2.0,That's excellent.
35401,PS6,3,12.4,12.8,0.4,1.0,Right.
35401,PS6,3,18.28,18.8,0.52,2.0,"OK, OK."
35401,PS6,3,19.68,33.2,13.52,1.0,"Well, I guess when you maybe when you sink, you breathe more and since it's the water is hot, how we kind of clear clean your lungs."
35401,PS6,3,35.92,37.56,1.64,2.0,"Yeah, of course, you know."
35401,PS6,3,39.32,40.72,1.4,1.0,Like so during the winter it's.
35401,PS6,3,41.48,42.24,0.76,2.0,A good exercise.
35401,PS6,3,43.16,43.4,0.24,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35401,PS6,3,44.12,44.36,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35401,PS6,3,46.2,54.0,7.8,3.0,"I would say to come up with like a very catchy song that is like really long or like something like that, no."
35401,PS6,3,54.88,59.76,4.88,1.0,But why would How to make people sing this?
35401,PS6,3,60.16,61.56,1.4,2.0,Should be like a motivation.
35401,PS6,3,61.8,64.16,2.36,2.0,Do you want to impress your crush?
35401,PS6,3,64.68,65.04,0.36,1.0,You can.
35401,PS6,3,66.84,72.08,5.24,2.0,Try singing in a shower for 20 minutes but.
35401,PS6,3,79.08,99.8,20.72,1.0,"Well, I mean, if it's if, if it's actually, if the research shows it's actually good for health, this means that then the NHS will have like less cases of so there's going to spend less money on people health."
35401,PS6,3,100.4,109.72,9.32,1.0,"So this would be good for the government, I guess like for, I don't know how to say like for the money of the government."
35401,PS6,3,110.4,122.68,12.28,1.0,"So maybe the government could like, come up with some idea like, I don't know, like an audio, like an I don't know."
35401,PS6,3,122.68,124.52,1.84,3.0,Like audio?
35401,PS6,3,124.52,126.28,1.76,1.0,Recording or something in the shower.
35401,PS6,3,126.6,136.72,10.12,1.0,So as more as I think I I think then I know it lowers your electricity bill or something like that.
35401,PS6,3,137.84,138.76,0.92,3.0,Or the water bill.
35401,PS6,3,138.88,139.04,0.16,3.0,Or the.
35401,PS6,3,139.04,139.84,0.8,1.0,Water bill.
35401,PS6,3,140.2,140.64,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

35401,PS6,3,168.28,170.44,2.16,1.0,"Think that's a good idea, that is, yeah, that's already."
35401,PS6,3,170.72,174.4,3.68,2.0,"Imagined, if really I will never imagine."
35401,PS6,3,174.68,178.28,3.6,2.0,"And government has that kind of program, which is interesting."
35401,PS6,3,178.68,179.76,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35401,PS6,3,180.32,188.24,7.92,1.0,"Yeah, but how do you how do you differentiate voice of from sink and only worries when the shower is on?"
35401,PS6,3,188.24,192.44,4.2,1.0,"Oh, but maybe this would make the people lose more water."
35401,PS6,3,193.24,197.76,4.52,1.0,It's just they turn off I on the shower and start sinking.
35401,PS6,3,197.76,200.08,2.32,1.0,I don't know.
35401,PS6,3,205.56,220.06,14.5,1.0,That is actually interesting because it has to be something that everybody likes to do.
35401,PS6,3,220.1,230.38,10.28,1.0,"For example, if it's like, oh, you're going to win a prize or something like that for the more like you're going to be on TV for your."

35401,PS6,3,403.16,406.6,3.44,2.0,For a good amount.
35401,PS6,3,407.88,408.36,0.48,2.0,Nice.

35401,PS6,3,414.84,418.52,3.68,1.0,"I'm not sure how it works here, but if the water it's owned by."
35401,PS6,3,419.04,420.56,1.52,2.0,"All right, the government, Yeah."
35401,PS6,3,421.04,425.04,4.0,1.0,This scenario supposing that otherwise or anything else owned by the government.

35401,PS6,3,425.84,427.76,1.92,1.0,Because otherwise it would be a private company.
35401,PS6,3,427.92,445.92,18.0,2.0,"Or would be useful if the government went I roll, roll yeah, roll the water supply supply."
35401,PS6,3,446.44,446.64,0.2,2.0,Yep.
35401,PS6,3,447.12,447.36,0.24,1.0,Right.

35227,PS4,3,36.28,50.04,13.76,2.0,"I guess like you could focus on the like unequal distribution of resources a bit and talk about like, well, obviously there's funding, but that's not."
35227,PS4,3,50.32,51.12,0.8,1.0,"Oh wait, hang on."
35227,PS4,3,51.12,56.6,5.48,1.0,"Does it mean resources to the disadvantaged groups, not to the privileged groups?"
35227,PS4,3,58.24,58.92,0.68,1.0,I don't understand the.
35227,PS4,3,58.96,59.24,0.28,2.0,Question.
35227,PS4,3,59.24,62.36,3.12,2.0,"Oh yeah, like unequal it like in both ways."
35227,PS4,3,62.36,62.52,0.16,2.0,Oh.
35227,PS4,3,62.56,63.76,1.2,1.0,"Yeah, sorry, it's unequal."
35227,PS4,3,64.72,65.2,0.48,1.0,"Yeah, I."
35227,PS4,3,65.24,66.0,0.76,2.0,See it now so.
35227,PS4,3,74.24,78.6,4.36,3.0,My mind like immediately goes to things like the Stormzy Grant and that kind.
35227,PS4,3,83.28,89.72,6.44,2.0,"Yeah, unlike teacher training, like it's that force like teachers to work in state schools."
35227,PS4,3,91.28,93.36,2.08,2.0,I think that's good.
35227,PS4,3,96.32,115.04,18.72,2.0,"Obviously paying teachers more would be better, but I think like teach 1st and stuff mean that there's like really high quality teachers, but there's still like an unequal distribution of them because obviously private schools pay more."
35227,PS4,3,125.44,131.52,6.08,1.0,I was thinking in terms of like saying uni level this also an unequal distribution.
35227,PS4,3,131.52,136.12,4.6,1.0,It's just not so much of disadvantage groups are.
35227,PS4,3,162.49,173.12,10.63,3.0,"We thinking like encouraging like people from less privileged backgrounds to apply to like apply to uni, like to apply to uni and that kind of thing."
35227,PS4,3,175.88,181.2,5.32,3.0,Or are we thinking more like providing the schools with the resource like?
35227,PS4,3,181.32,182.08,0.76,1.0,Providing schools.
35227,PS4,3,182.08,183.04,0.96,3.0,With resources.
35227,PS4,3,191.0,198.68,7.68,2.0,"Do not know, it would be possible to maybe be more creative if it was about encouraging people with resources."
35227,PS4,3,198.68,203.6,4.92,2.0,"It's just a bit of like a well, the issue is like."
35227,PS4,3,204.48,204.8,0.32,3.0,Money.
35227,PS4,3,204.96,205.44,0.48,2.0,Money.
35227,PS4,3,205.44,214.39,8.95,2.0,"Yeah, you could."
35227,PS4,3,214.43,214.79,0.36,2.0,I don't know.
35227,PS4,3,215.59,215.91,0.32,3.0,I don't know.
35227,PS4,3,218.11,219.63,1.52,2.0,Never mind.
35227,PS4,3,224.67,225.47,0.8,1.0,Because it's tough.
35227,PS4,3,225.47,229.12,3.65,1.0,Because how maybe people could just.
35227,PS4,3,229.12,229.72,0.6,2.0,Get private.
35227,PS4,3,229.72,234.88,5.16,1.0,Tutoring and it's not going to like solve.
35227,PS4,3,234.88,235.52,0.64,2.0,The issue no.
35227,PS4,3,236.68,240.0,3.32,1.0,Matter how we allocate the resources.
35227,PS4,3,249.45,249.77,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35227,PS4,3,250.09,259.45,9.36,2.0,"And maybe the issue is in distribution, like the distributor of I guess like teachers are like teacher training schools."
35227,PS4,3,260.05,268.2,8.15,2.0,"And if if you did actually make it so that anyone, I don't think, I don't know whether there are any teacher training."
35227,PS4,3,270.12,273.36,3.24,2.0,"Maybe if you trained to be a teacher, I don't really know how to teach training works to be honest."
35227,PS4,3,273.36,281.88,8.52,2.0,"But maybe you can train a teacher like here, like at university, they don't need to go to like Teach First because they've got a teaching qualification."
35227,PS4,3,282.4,305.32,22.92,2.0,"But if you made it, if you like regulated that people had to like do a a year, not even a year, like like a stint, like 5 years, because like doctors train for a really long time to become doctors."
35227,PS4,3,305.64,312.92,7.28,2.0,"And like, it could be a kind of thing that not necessarily that you that it's part of the training, because that would be like unfair."
35227,PS4,3,312.92,331.6,18.68,2.0,But for to be able to graduate or like a condition of your graduation is that you go to these places or you like become like associated with a branch like Teach First or like ark ark academies for the first little while.
35227,PS4,3,335.84,336.52,0.68,3.0,"I like that, yeah."
35227,PS4,3,337.64,343.64,6.0,3.0,"Like work experience in the most like disadvantaged, like community areas."
35227,PS4,3,345.0,357.68,12.68,2.0,"Yeah, because and as well, I feel like a lack of teaching, a lack of a teacher to teach it can mean like fewer like a levels offered like some private schools can offer like."
35227,PS4,3,358.08,358.64,0.56,3.0,Latin.
35227,PS4,3,358.88,370.92,12.04,2.0,"Yeah, like psychology and like I did economics and you can't sometimes there are schools that don't offer those things and then you go to uni and they'll teach the fact that what like what you learn a level."
35227,PS4,3,371.2,382.36,11.16,2.0,"But yeah, and like, I guess like be like a drive on teachers that can teach like add new."
35227,PS4,3,383.24,384.64,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, variety."
35227,PS4,3,384.8,390.04,5.24,3.0,"Yeah, no, I really like the idea also to be like radical."
35227,PS4,3,390.4,407.76,17.36,3.0,Maybe it it could be about like detracting the like private school kids away from like applying to swap uni is like like by increasing the awareness of things like apprenticeships and that.
35227,PS4,3,407.76,408.84,1.08,2.0,"Kind of thing, yeah."
35227,PS4,3,411.08,417.04,5.96,3.0,"To to like people in the most advantage, just to like kind of equal."
35227,PS4,3,417.04,425.52,8.48,2.0,"It out, yeah, because I feel like stuff like apprenticeships is not actually publicized."
35227,PS4,3,425.64,426.4,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35227,PS4,3,426.44,426.68,0.24,2.0,At.
35227,PS4,3,426.68,427.24,0.56,3.0,"All, Yeah."
35227,PS4,3,427.68,434.8,7.12,2.0,"To people who don't want to or like, for people who are not interested in university, but they're publicized to everyone."
35227,PS4,3,435.28,436.88,1.6,2.0,People might take them up.
35227,PS4,3,436.88,437.2,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35227,PS4,3,437.52,444.68,7.16,2.0,"Or like, do 1 right away and then decide whether or not they want to go to university."
35227,PS4,3,444.68,444.8,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35227,PS4,3,444.8,445.8,1.0,2.0,Such a thing that we can go.
35227,PS4,3,446.12,448.44,2.32,3.0,"Straight away, Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35227,PS4,3,455.4,457.0,1.6,1.0,"Sorry, do you mind repeating the?"
35227,PS4,3,457.28,457.6,0.32,1.0,Oh yeah.
35227,PS4,3,457.6,481.44,23.84,2.0,Teach like for people like for people gaining teaching qualifications at universities outside of like government funded structures like Teach First to be required to be affiliated with an organization like Teach First.
35227,PS4,3,481.8,493.6,11.8,2.0,Or there's there's a wonderful Park Academy which requires them to do a certain amount of stage school teaching in one place.
35227,PS4,3,493.6,498.4,4.8,2.0,Like not like bouncing around like in one place after that graduation.
35227,PS4,3,516.03,516.95,0.92,2.0,Forgot we were on the timer.
35227,PS4,3,517.75,518.79,1.04,1.0,"Oh yeah, 3 minutes."
35227,PS4,3,521.84,522.64,0.8,3.0,And that was good.
35227,PS4,3,531.48,532.72,1.24,1.0,There's some tissue behind you.
35227,PS4,3,579.46,579.74,0.28,2.0,Hello.
35227,PS4,3,579.82,579.98,0.16,2.0,Hello.
35227,PS4,3,580.02,581.26,1.24,2.0,Do you mind if I get my?

35227,PS4,3,587.68,588.64,0.96,2.0,Finish what's left of our tea.
35227,PS4,3,588.64,592.32,3.68,2.0,I won't go very far.
35227,PS4,3,601.92,602.72,0.8,1.0,2 minutes.
35227,PS4,3,604.16,604.96,0.8,1.0,2 minutes.
35227,PS4,3,605.76,606.16,0.4,2.0,2 minutes.
35227,PS4,3,606.4,606.76,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, cool."
35227,PS4,3,607.32,607.92,0.6,2.0,Should we?
35227,PS4,3,607.96,608.2,0.24,2.0,You'll get.
35227,PS4,3,609.56,610.56,1.0,3.0,"That one, yeah, Great."
35227,PS4,3,610.72,611.08,0.36,3.0,Yeah.
35227,PS4,3,611.32,612.32,1.0,1.0,So wait for you too.
35227,PS4,3,635.96,636.76,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, take your time."
35227,PS4,3,657.32,658.32,1.0,2.0,"Oh, you've got lemon and ginger."
35227,PS4,3,658.72,659.16,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
35227,PS4,3,659.56,659.8,0.24,2.0,Nice.
35227,PS4,3,710.0,710.76,0.76,1.0,"Oh, perfect."
35227,PS4,3,710.76,711.44,0.68,1.0,It's just coming.
35177,PS2,6,1.4,8.4,7.0,1.0,Vulnerable increase within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
35177,PS2,6,12.68,14.32,1.64,1.0,"This is so, yeah."
35177,PS2,6,16.52,17.16,0.64,2.0,Would be to have.
35177,PS2,6,17.84,18.52,0.68,3.0,Contingencies.
35177,PS2,6,18.76,20.24,1.48,1.0,Like have insurance and all.
35177,PS2,6,20.48,20.68,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
35177,PS2,6,20.88,23.04,2.16,3.0,"Well, yeah, insurance, but also different suppliers."
35177,PS2,6,23.2,23.56,0.36,3.0,I'm not.
35177,PS2,6,23.56,23.96,0.4,2.0,Relying on.
35177,PS2,6,24.0,24.24,0.24,3.0,1
35177,PS2,6,24.32,24.84,0.52,4.0,Yeah.
35177,PS2,6,25.2,26.24,1.04,3.0,Like spraying the Yeah.
35177,PS2,6,26.4,26.92,0.52,1.0,"Oh, right."
35177,PS2,6,27.12,27.52,0.4,4.0,Yeah.
35177,PS2,6,27.52,33.04,5.52,4.0,"And also like the the option to be flexible with your own supply chain, right."
35177,PS2,6,33.88,38.48,4.6,4.0,So how be able to build systems that can allow you to change what you're doing quickly?
35177,PS2,6,39.8,42.04,2.24,1.0,So adaptation using.
35177,PS2,6,43.92,44.52,0.6,3.0,Oh yeah.
35177,PS2,6,54.36,57.0,2.64,1.0,"As we said, deficiencies."
35177,PS2,6,78.48,79.56,1.08,1.0,I think monitoring.
35177,PS2,6,80.16,80.64,0.48,5.0,Monitoring.
35177,PS2,6,80.68,81.48,0.8,1.0,"Monitoring, yeah."
35177,PS2,6,83.6,84.84,1.24,3.0,I agree with insurance.
35177,PS2,6,86.28,90.24,3.96,1.0,"I think contingency slash insurance might be there, but and."
35177,PS2,6,90.32,91.8,1.48,6.0,"Usually that's how it is, yeah, yeah."
35177,PS2,6,93.88,94.96,1.08,1.0,So we want all that I.
35177,PS2,6,96.48,98.76,2.28,5.0,Mean the apple is to just bring everything in have.
35177,PS2,6,99.76,101.08,1.32,2.0,So you don't depend on all the supply.
35177,PS2,6,101.44,104.84,3.4,4.0,"Yeah, you you could also like try to predict."
35177,PS2,6,105.56,106.6,1.04,1.0,What's going to open in the future?
35177,PS2,6,106.6,114.08,7.48,1.0,"So say like you're an Amazon driver, you need to know if there's going to be traffic or something and then you can change your delivery schedule."
35177,PS2,6,114.48,114.72,0.24,3.0,So it's.
35177,PS2,6,114.72,115.56,0.84,1.0,Like 4 hours.
35177,PS2,6,118.48,119.96,1.48,1.0,So basically forecasting the idea.
35177,PS2,6,129.04,132.12,3.08,1.0,"I think also accounting for time lags, right?"
35177,PS2,6,132.12,137.92,5.8,1.0,"Like if you're expecting something to get delivered in two days, but maybe make it 2 1/2 days or something."
35177,PS2,6,138.28,140.6,2.32,1.0,"So that way, but that goes back to the contingency."
35177,PS2,6,140.6,141.12,0.52,4.0,"Yeah, I think."
35177,PS2,6,141.8,142.16,0.36,1.0,Insurance.
35177,PS2,6,143.04,143.68,0.64,5.0,"Yeah, referencing."
35177,PS2,6,143.76,145.0,1.24,5.0,Do you want to just have?
35177,PS2,6,146.08,150.44,4.36,5.0,"I mean say for example going back to the item example, if you just have the the items."
35177,PS2,6,150.76,151.92,1.16,3.0,Then you have that time.
35177,PS2,6,151.96,152.2,0.24,5.0,Gap.
35177,PS2,6,153.04,154.32,1.28,3.0,To to the new ones.
35177,PS2,6,155.6,155.96,0.36,5.0,I'm making.
35177,PS2,6,156.0,156.88,0.88,3.0,Sense basically you already.
35177,PS2,6,156.88,157.08,0.2,2.0,Have a.
35177,PS2,6,157.08,157.32,0.24,3.0,Stock.
35177,PS2,6,157.36,157.68,0.32,5.0,In place.
35177,PS2,6,158.48,160.8,2.32,3.0,So that choose availability to take.
35177,PS2,6,160.92,164.4,3.48,1.0,Do you then mean having the stock in place?
35177,PS2,6,165.24,165.48,0.24,3.0,Like.
35177,PS2,6,165.72,166.56,0.84,1.0,"Like surplus, Yeah."
35177,PS2,6,166.6,166.92,0.32,2.0,That's like.
35177,PS2,6,168.2,169.32,1.12,3.0,"Decentralized, yeah."
35177,PS2,6,170.36,173.12,2.76,1.0,Surplus and as it goes down below a limit you.
35177,PS2,6,173.76,173.96,0.2,3.0,Just.
35177,PS2,6,178.96,182.04,3.08,4.0,I think also one of the main things that people talk.
35177,PS2,6,182.04,188.04,6.0,1.0,"About is for the pandemic, for example, is that those families have the creativity to imagine that such a scenario could happen."
35177,PS2,6,188.04,192.0,3.96,1.0,"I think this goes also under forecasting, but."
35177,PS2,6,192.28,197.88,5.6,4.0,You have to even know that the risk is is able to happen in order to try to.
35177,PS2,6,198.64,198.84,0.2,1.0,Plan.
35177,PS2,6,198.88,199.32,0.44,3.0,For it.
35177,PS2,6,201.6,203.64,2.04,5.0,I suppose apart from diversifying.
35177,PS2,6,204.0,204.92,0.92,3.0,Your supplies you could.
35177,PS2,6,205.28,207.32,2.04,5.0,Diversify geographies of where you make.
35177,PS2,6,208.04,209.68,1.64,5.0,"I mean, depending if you're large enough, yeah."
35177,PS2,6,209.68,214.2,4.52,3.0,"Sorry, could you say that again you can diversify the."
35177,PS2,6,214.28,216.96,2.68,2.0,"Geographies, the way you're producing, if you're large enough."
35177,PS2,6,217.24,217.48,0.24,5.0,I think.
35177,PS2,6,225.92,227.48,1.56,3.0,That's basically supply chain.
35177,PS2,6,232.08,234.0,1.92,1.0,"They really didn't, but anytime I."
35177,PS2,6,235.0,235.72,0.72,2.0,Only offer.
35177,PS2,6,235.72,237.88,2.16,3.0,Software so you don't have supply chain programs.
35177,PS2,6,245.32,246.84,1.52,4.0,I mean even then you have to have like.
35177,PS2,6,247.2,248.08,0.88,1.0,People on hold.
35177,PS2,6,248.68,249.96,1.28,4.0,It's your your code in.
35177,PS2,6,250.32,251.24,0.92,1.0,The middle of the lines.
35177,PS2,6,256.96,258.0,1.04,1.0,"If that's it, right?"
35177,PS2,6,258.24,258.8,0.56,3.0,Can we?
35177,PS2,6,265.0,265.28,0.28,4.0,OK.
35177,PS2,6,268.32,269.84,1.52,1.0,"To be fair, I think the AI would."
35177,PS2,6,270.6,271.08,0.48,5.0,Also.
35177,PS2,6,271.16,271.68,0.52,3.0,Give out.
35177,PS2,6,271.68,273.08,1.4,1.0,"Similar things, yeah, I'm going."
35177,PS2,6,273.24,273.32,0.08,4.0,To.
35177,PS2,6,278.16,279.48,1.32,3.0,Ask the AI after this session.
35177,PS2,6,283.16,284.84,1.68,1.0,I would ask it for the sorry example.
35177,PS2,6,284.84,285.64,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, that was a."
35177,PS2,6,285.68,286.12,0.44,4.0,Fun.
35177,PS2,6,286.48,286.84,0.36,4.0,Yeah.
35177,PS2,6,288.44,290.04,1.6,4.0,Jingle supply.
35177,PS2,6,361.6,361.72,0.12,5.0,None.
35177,PS2,6,403.16,403.28,0.12,5.0,None.
35177,PS2,6,425.65,427.89,2.24,4.0,How do we fit in the diversifying?
35177,PS2,6,431.93,435.53,3.6,1.0,Maybe after stock surplus we could also put that right.
35177,PS2,6,435.61,446.08,10.47,1.0,Diversifying supply chain Supply chain suppliers is.
35177,PS2,6,446.08,446.4,0.32,6.0,That what?
35177,PS2,6,446.4,446.8,0.4,1.0,It is.
35177,PS2,6,447.16,448.0,0.84,5.0,Do you mean supply?
35177,PS2,6,448.0,449.08,1.08,3.0,Chain diversification.
35177,PS2,6,450.12,452.64,2.52,5.0,"Yeah, let's."
35177,PS2,6,454.4,455.44,1.04,3.0,Build diversification.
35177,PS2,6,499.59,506.79,7.2,4.0,"I feel like yeah, yes."
35177,PS2,6,513.04,514.44,1.4,1.0,To change strategies is.
35177,PS2,6,514.44,514.64,0.2,3.0,There.
35177,PS2,6,514.8,515.2,0.4,3.0,"Yeah, that's."
35177,PS2,6,521.6,521.72,0.12,1.0,True.
35177,PS2,6,521.72,540.28,18.56,1.0,"Do you think creating with that's a cost, creating like shorter supply chains so that movement, if movement from one, let's say 1 country to another is so difficult, but moving let's say like in parts that might be easier, but that's also way more expensive?"
35177,PS2,6,544.76,548.56,3.8,4.0,"Also, doing it in parts means that like if any one of those parts breaks, you could end up."
35177,PS2,6,548.56,548.96,0.4,3.0,Being.
35177,PS2,6,550.2,558.0,7.8,4.0,"You know, so that that could actually like be increasing the risk depending on it's, it's so harder because it's not like a specific example."
35177,PS2,6,558.0,560.52,2.52,4.0,This is just supply chains in general.
35177,PS2,6,560.52,560.6,0.08,3.0,We.
35177,PS2,6,562.68,563.8,1.12,1.0,"Send it out, we have."
35177,PS2,6,568.36,571.16,2.8,4.0,I don't have any particular things to add.
35177,PS2,6,572.4,573.88,1.48,1.0,I think then let's just send.
35850,PS1,3,2.04,5.28,3.24,1.0,Oh plastic races for a lifetime.
35850,PS1,3,5.28,8.28,3.0,1.0,Please come up with creative videos which is plastic pollution.
35850,PS1,3,15.92,23.4,7.48,2.0,"Well, you could have a big recycling scheme, national, you know."
35850,PS1,3,23.92,25.68,1.76,3.0,Or stop producing any person.
35850,PS1,3,25.96,27.4,1.44,2.0,"True, you could just ban, yeah."
35850,PS1,3,28.36,41.76,13.4,3.0,"It's like, going to be like, governmentally like restriction and yeah, like, it's like illegal stuff if you produce plastic, you know, like go to prison."
35850,PS1,3,42.6,43.72,1.12,2.0,"Yeah, you could just ban it."
35850,PS1,3,44.4,44.6,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS1,3,45.16,46.4,1.24,2.0,And then I guess so.
35850,PS1,3,46.4,47.6,1.2,2.0,That's one.
35850,PS1,3,47.84,59.76,11.92,2.0,"So yeah, we stop any more plastic coming into the system, but then we also need to stop the current plastic that's, you know, on the Earth polluting."
35850,PS1,3,60.08,62.28,2.2,2.0,So it seems to be a multifaceted.
35850,PS1,3,62.28,65.44,3.16,1.0,Approach OK.
35850,PS1,3,66.48,73.04,6.56,3.0,"But like, do people need plastic in the not like in not in the daily life, but like."
35850,PS1,3,74.48,77.28,2.8,2.0,"I think, I think he finds everywhere, yeah."
35850,PS1,3,79.0,85.2,6.2,1.0,"Yeah, I suppose what was something like really creative."
35850,PS1,3,86.04,87.44,1.4,1.0,So I feel like banning is quite a.
35850,PS1,3,88.28,88.64,0.36,2.0,"Yeah, I do."
35850,PS1,3,89.0,91.56,2.56,2.0,"OK, You could just start."
35850,PS1,3,94.04,105.56,11.52,2.0,"What about like for you could start making things out of old plastic, like a new town on a raft made out of plastic?"
35850,PS1,3,106.8,109.64,2.84,2.0,Because I have seen that thing somewhere.
35850,PS1,3,109.92,110.4,0.48,1.0,OK.
35850,PS1,3,110.84,111.16,0.32,2.0,So you.
35850,PS1,3,111.72,119.48,7.76,1.0,So we make a floating town out out of plastic and then it it floats around the oceans collecting more plastics and getting bigger.
35850,PS1,3,119.52,120.92,1.4,2.0,"Well, I think that's quite creative."
35850,PS1,3,122.4,126.6,4.2,1.0,"Good sounds like a like a really bad science fiction book, but it is creative."
35850,PS1,3,129.52,131.4,1.88,2.0,"So yeah, I don't know."
35850,PS1,3,133.8,133.96,0.16,1.0,So.
35850,PS1,3,134.8,142.84,8.04,2.0,"Or yeah, another one would just be you earn 10 P for every plastic you correctly recycle."
35850,PS1,3,144.52,145.2,0.68,3.0,Like Germany?
35850,PS1,3,145.76,146.0,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
35850,PS1,3,148.24,151.4,3.16,2.0,"Yeah, not quite as creative, but probably more realistic."
35850,PS1,3,151.4,151.68,0.28,2.0,"Yeah, it's."
35850,PS1,3,152.76,153.32,0.56,3.0,Really sick.
35850,PS1,3,155.24,157.72,2.48,1.0,"OK, So what do we want to put down?"
35850,PS1,3,157.72,159.2,1.48,2.0,Plus also.
35850,PS1,3,160.84,163.12,2.28,1.0,What's a cladding of floating island of plastic?
35850,PS1,3,163.28,174.08,10.8,3.0,Floating like machine which like recycle plastic and people can have it at home or like places like fabrics.
35850,PS1,3,174.36,184.44,10.08,1.0,What about like a like a 3D printer where you feed in plastics and then it's kind of a fun thing that people can have at home and make something for themselves out?
35850,PS1,3,184.44,188.48,4.04,2.0,"Of there, but then but then people are just going to be buying more plastics."
35850,PS1,3,188.48,190.96,2.48,2.0,"They're like, I want to use my cool new 3D printer."
35850,PS1,3,191.0,193.08,2.08,2.0,Then you buy 100 plastic wrist bottles.
35850,PS1,3,193.96,194.56,0.6,1.0,That's true.
35850,PS1,3,195.44,196.12,0.68,1.0,I would do that.
35850,PS1,3,201.64,214.92,13.28,2.0,"Because I've seen, I've seen things where like in places they have this big, you know, plastic depository like by the beach and then they make like a sculpture out of it, I guess."
35850,PS1,3,215.28,225.68,10.4,1.0,"Yeah, so maybe like do cool things international and Olympics of like plastic competition and whoever gets the most plastic swings."
35850,PS1,3,225.92,229.24,3.32,2.0,"But then, but it has to be, you can't have bought it for it."
35850,PS1,3,229.28,231.56,2.28,2.0,That's just a rule because I guess.
35850,PS1,3,231.56,233.32,1.76,3.0,How you going to check?
35850,PS1,3,233.68,235.96,2.28,2.0,You can just check I guess.
35850,PS1,3,236.12,237.64,1.52,2.0,I guess with like the whole straws.
35850,PS1,3,237.64,245.36,7.72,2.0,"They literally made one, made it really unpopular to come up with like a cool bamboo alternative and then just ban them."
35850,PS1,3,246.56,253.72,7.16,3.0,"Yeah, like, because we're like for now, we're like, how to say plastic?"
35850,PS1,3,256.08,256.88,0.8,3.0,What was the name?
35850,PS1,3,256.92,258.2,1.28,3.0,"Addiction, Plastic addiction."
35850,PS1,3,258.2,260.92,2.72,3.0,"So like, you cannot just stop using plastic."
35850,PS1,3,261.76,276.04,14.28,1.0,"Well, then maybe we like use the straw example and like say we've got like the three-step plan where for all of the plastics that we use in our life, we'll make them unpopular, then produce an alternative."
35850,PS1,3,277.12,280.04,2.92,1.0,And then once your alternative has like got uptake.
35850,PS1,3,280.04,289.04,9.0,3.0,"The alternative like more popular than the plastic yeah, yeah, it has to be cheaper than plastic so people gonna."
35850,PS1,3,289.44,290.04,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
35850,PS1,3,290.24,291.4,1.16,3.0,So it can be over.
35850,PS1,3,291.44,293.36,1.92,1.0,Subsidized an alternative.
35850,PS1,3,293.68,296.12,2.44,2.0,Or it's just so cool that you pay it for the month.
35850,PS1,3,296.2,297.68,1.48,2.0,That's one because you know it's a well.
35850,PS1,3,297.84,306.08,8.24,3.0,"The cool thing is just like, works for a short time, yeah, because it's got people, so."
35850,PS1,3,309.08,315.92,6.84,2.0,"Yeah, to be honest, I don't love the paper straws, but."
35850,PS1,3,316.64,316.92,0.28,3.0,I hear.
35850,PS1,3,317.28,317.96,0.68,1.0,Them awful.
35850,PS1,3,319.52,320.8,1.28,1.0,Quite like the metal straws.
35850,PS1,3,320.92,321.68,0.76,1.0,"I think they're nice, yeah."
35850,PS1,3,322.6,324.08,1.48,2.0,"But cleaning it, it's just such a nice."
35850,PS1,3,324.88,325.76,0.88,2.0,Have you ever cleaned it?
35850,PS1,3,327.12,329.0,1.88,1.0,I don't think I've ever liked to use one myself.
35850,PS1,3,329.32,334.24,4.92,1.0,I got one from a careers fair in the econ library once and I haven't used it yet because.
35850,PS1,3,355.58,360.46,4.88,2.0,"Like there is those things like instead of using cling film, there are these like beeswax."
35850,PS1,3,362.02,362.18,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35850,PS1,3,365.26,373.22,7.96,2.0,"So that's the sort of thing I'm thinking of, where probably is more expensive, but then at least you can reuse it forever."
35850,PS1,3,377.24,379.16,1.92,3.0,How do you like recycle the plastic?
35850,PS1,3,379.16,380.68,1.52,3.0,"It should be burned, right?"
35850,PS1,3,382.76,385.84,3.08,1.0,I think don't you just turn it into another plastic?
35850,PS1,3,385.84,389.44,3.6,1.0,Because I think burning it releases like a lot of toxins.
35850,PS1,3,389.48,392.8,3.32,2.0,"And stuff, you melt it down and then just, yeah, I don't know."
35850,PS1,3,393.84,395.92,2.08,2.0,I mean a lot of plastic you can't recycle anyway.
35850,PS1,3,396.32,403.28,6.96,3.0,"Yeah, I'm thinking like, oh, crazy, like plastic like recycler and yeah."
35850,PS1,3,403.92,411.92,8.0,2.0,There was our is our floating town coming in finally.
35850,PS1,3,412.8,415.76,2.96,1.0,Finally creates a massive plastic floating plastic towel.
35850,PS1,3,419.56,420.36,0.8,1.0,"OK, So what?"
35850,PS1,3,420.36,421.88,1.52,1.0,What do you want to put in there?
35850,PS1,3,423.12,423.68,0.56,2.0,We don't have to.
35850,PS1,3,423.68,424.2,0.52,1.0,Put massive.
35850,PS1,3,424.4,425.56,1.16,1.0,I mean it is creative.
35850,PS1,3,426.0,428.24,2.24,1.0,I bet an AI wouldn't think of massive.
35850,PS1,3,428.24,429.12,0.88,1.0,"Floating town, yeah."
35850,PS1,3,434.24,446.08,11.84,2.0,"You could you could so do what our third one was like ban then once it's, you know, feasible ban future production."
35850,PS1,3,446.52,453.96,7.44,2.0,Then alongside a small one off like advertising scheme where they make a small.
35850,PS1,3,457.16,465.24,8.08,3.0,"Oh, you can buy like more than so like one of plastic each month or something like that."
35850,PS1,3,465.72,466.32,0.6,3.0,You know what I mean?
35850,PS1,3,466.92,475.04,8.12,3.0,And like you can check it by like your bank statement where like your check is going to say if you vote like it was it contains plastic or no like.
35850,PS1,3,479.08,482.6,3.52,2.0,"A carbon limit, but with plastic."
35850,PS1,3,483.04,483.32,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35850,PS1,3,487.52,489.44,1.92,2.0,To then eventually pays out you could say.
35850,PS1,3,490.48,500.24,9.76,3.0,"Yeah, like you're going to see not calories, how many grams of plastic it contains."
35850,PS1,3,500.24,502.96,2.72,3.0,"So it's going to sum up, sum up some."
35850,PS1,3,504.04,506.84,2.8,3.0,"Yeah, you're going to reach the limit."
35850,PS1,3,547.28,557.08,9.8,2.0,"That it's already polluted or like plastic pollution in the ocean or river, whatever."
35850,PS1,3,557.08,558.6,1.52,2.0,Probably water this town is on.
35850,PS1,3,571.36,571.6,0.24,3.0,Yeah.

36540,PS4,3,393.6,401.88,8.28,3.0,"Kid and then you click on here and whatever it is learning, you can just you can just impart that thing through the robot basically."
36540,PS4,3,402.52,410.36,7.84,2.0,"So say like private school teachers, like these robots were trained in the classrooms of private schools, so they're getting the instruction."
36540,PS4,3,411.44,411.8,0.36,3.0,Quality.
36540,PS4,3,411.8,412.96,1.16,3.0,"The quality teachers, yeah."

36540,PS4,3,421.0,421.36,0.36,3.0,Good idea.
36540,PS4,3,421.52,421.96,0.44,3.0,It's not.
36540,PS4,3,421.96,422.08,0.12,2.0,Bad.
36540,PS4,3,422.44,423.44,1.0,1.0,Startup robot I'm.
36540,PS4,3,424.8,432.16,7.36,2.0,"Not sure about the robot part, but like the the fundamental idea here, yeah, it's basically like Open Access private school resources."
36540,PS4,3,432.92,433.12,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
36540,PS4,3,433.44,442.56,9.12,3.0,"And so this money, basically this person, this kid with school kid is paying fee for himself as well as the one working somewhere."
36540,PS4,3,442.64,443.64,1.0,2.0,Else like Tom's shoes so.
36540,PS4,3,444.0,444.44,0.44,3.0,It's not.
36540,PS4,3,444.56,445.68,1.12,3.0,It's not with taxes.
36540,PS4,3,445.72,446.68,0.96,3.0,It's not with taxes.
36540,PS4,3,446.8,447.64,0.84,3.0,It's part of your fees.

36540,PS4,3,451.56,453.84,2.28,3.0,"Yeah, there."
36540,PS4,3,454.0,454.2,0.2,1.0,We go.
36540,PS4,3,454.4,455.96,1.56,2.0,And that gets rid of some of the inequalities.
36540,PS4,3,456.92,459.0,2.08,1.0,Funded by the private school tuition.
36540,PS4,3,459.2,459.8,0.6,1.0,"Oh, funded."
36540,PS4,3,459.96,462.72,2.76,3.0,"Yeah, it's part of the tuition for the ritual funds."
36540,PS4,3,466.12,469.44,3.32,1.0,Should we keep it?
36540,PS4,3,469.44,470.16,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, I know."
36540,PS4,3,470.52,470.76,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36540,PS4,3,470.76,474.64,3.88,1.0,What is this one of those like studies where like the actual thing they're studying is not?
36540,PS4,3,474.64,477.44,2.8,3.0,Is this like just 8 minutes in right something?
36540,PS4,3,477.8,480.72,2.92,2.0,"Like that, I don't remember when we started on to the next."
36540,PS4,3,480.88,481.64,0.76,1.0,Next ready Good this.
36540,PS4,3,481.96,483.92,1.96,2.0,Is the the creative use one I was something else?
36131,PS5,3,0.04,1.2,1.16,1.0,That was like the first question before.
36131,PS5,3,2.04,2.64,0.6,2.0,"Oh God, attrition."
36131,PS5,3,6.04,6.48,0.44,3.0,What's that?
36131,PS5,3,14.6,17.52,2.92,1.0,Is attrition like firing yourself?
36131,PS5,3,18.8,19.8,1.0,2.0,I I guess so.
36131,PS5,3,19.8,26.0,6.2,2.0,"I've never like, I've never seen this word before."
36131,PS5,3,28.52,28.76,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
36131,PS5,3,28.76,34.88,6.12,2.0,"So I guess it's just, I guess it's just what it says voluntary I guess as opposed to involuntary attrition which will be firing, so."
36131,PS5,3,35.2,39.72,4.52,1.0,"I guess, OK, but then obviously people are not going to leave if they're happy, right?"
36131,PS5,3,40.28,47.12,6.84,2.0,"Well, I guess that's why it's like reduction in value talent in the workforce, because obviously because if they were like a rubbish employee, they'd be fired."
36131,PS5,3,47.6,52.24,4.64,2.0,"But if it's voluntary attrition, they must have been decent, but they're leaving for some reason."
36131,PS5,3,52.56,52.96,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, well."
36131,PS5,3,54.44,61.56,7.12,3.0,Probably they're leaving because of either money or the team.
36131,PS5,3,61.64,70.0,8.36,3.0,"I think the team will probably be a big factor or just benefits the company itself, right?"
36131,PS5,3,70.12,70.36,0.24,3.0,Yes.
36131,PS5,3,72.92,74.28,1.36,2.0,Like insurance I guess.
36131,PS5,3,74.76,80.8,6.04,1.0,"I mean, I, I think if you're happy where you're working, you're not going to leave a less."
36131,PS5,3,81.28,90.2,8.92,3.0,"Yeah, I think if you if you have a strong bond with your team, you're much less likely to just leave because of money or something."
36131,PS5,3,90.6,91.64,1.04,1.0,So have parties.
36131,PS5,3,92.04,105.4,13.36,1.0,"Yeah, I know like a lot of like companies do like events where they like connection events when they play games."
36131,PS5,3,105.92,108.0,2.08,2.0,"Yeah, I mean, no one likes them."
36131,PS5,3,108.56,108.84,0.28,2.0,I know.
36131,PS5,3,108.88,110.96,2.08,1.0,But I'm thinking about my department.
36131,PS5,3,110.96,113.24,2.28,1.0,The reason I love it so much is because.
36131,PS5,3,113.84,115.36,1.52,2.0,"Oh, they do that stuff and it's like, good."
36131,PS5,3,115.36,125.32,9.96,1.0,"No, we don't do that stuff, but we have like seminars and then we have receptions after seminars and then we have a glass of wine and talk and then we have parties a lot and like, it's a good environment."
36131,PS5,3,125.44,125.88,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
36131,PS5,3,131.32,140.6,9.28,1.0,"So I would say it doesn't like, you know, have an established like tea and cake, finger wine and chicken wine."
36131,PS5,3,140.8,141.4,0.6,3.0,Like night.
36131,PS5,3,141.48,150.16,8.68,1.0,"Cheese, wine, the way to be happy."
36131,PS5,3,150.16,151.32,1.16,1.0,Basically alcohol.
36131,PS5,3,151.72,153.56,1.84,2.0,Voluntary Social.
36131,PS5,3,156.84,159.16,2.32,1.0,"We're just to say, yeah, you're not going to leave me for cheese."
36131,PS5,3,159.48,160.08,0.6,2.0,And wine.
36131,PS5,3,169.0,169.68,0.68,3.0,Won't create.
36131,PS5,3,169.68,172.36,2.68,3.0,"If I get to stop a little, it's."
36131,PS5,3,174.96,177.64,2.68,2.0,A criminal criminalized leaving.
36131,PS5,3,180.92,181.48,0.56,1.0,You need that.
36131,PS5,3,181.56,182.24,0.68,1.0,You need that.
36131,PS5,3,184.56,190.4,5.84,3.0,"Whenever they come up to you with their when they want to leave you, just fire them instantly."
36131,PS5,3,198.32,199.16,0.84,3.0,That's the creative.
36131,PS5,3,200.04,201.04,1.0,2.0,I'll put it in the list.
36131,PS5,3,203.88,204.52,0.64,2.0,I'm going to put it.
36131,PS5,3,205.28,206.52,1.24,2.0,AI won't say that.
36131,PS5,3,209.36,225.72,16.36,1.0,"Or like if someone wants to leave, they could like come up to with like maybe anonymously reason why they want to leave before leaving so that the company can tackle them."
36131,PS5,3,227.16,227.8,0.64,3.0,That's a good one.
36131,PS5,3,228.32,228.8,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36131,PS5,3,231.0,231.84,0.84,1.0,"Oh, fire them."
36131,PS5,3,233.72,235.2,1.48,2.0,So they know to fire them you.
36131,PS5,3,235.84,236.8,0.96,1.0,Know like I'm not.
36131,PS5,3,237.12,239.4,2.28,1.0,"You're not breaking up with me, I'm breaking up with you."
36131,PS5,3,246.32,248.36,2.04,3.0,"I think it's actually shittier for the company, right?"
36131,PS5,3,248.44,256.08,7.64,3.0,Because they have to pay longer if you fire someone and there's a lot more documentation involved.
36131,PS5,3,256.2,261.32,5.12,1.0,"In that you have to have a good reason as well, otherwise you could like go to yeah file."
36131,PS5,3,281.72,284.48,2.76,3.0,That's your complaints policy.
36131,PS5,3,287.52,291.28,3.76,1.0,I feel like you know instead of but this wouldn't stop voluntarily.
36131,PS5,3,291.52,296.36,4.84,1.0,But I was thinking to help with the reduction of value talent.
36131,PS5,3,296.76,300.0,3.24,1.0,"Like if someone wants to leave, you need to find someone else and train."
36131,PS5,3,301.68,305.36,3.68,2.0,Them keep them until they've found their successor.
36131,PS5,3,309.68,310.08,0.4,1.0,But then.
36131,PS5,3,310.08,311.68,1.6,1.0,But then that wouldn't stop voluntary.
36131,PS5,3,312.48,313.08,0.6,2.0,"No, it wouldn't."
36131,PS5,3,313.08,314.16,1.08,2.0,"Actually, no, but no."
36131,PS5,3,314.16,314.84,0.68,2.0,But it is.
36131,PS5,3,315.16,324.5,9.34,1.0,"If it's a solution by like you know, I don't know, fire them."
36131,PS5,3,326.06,327.18,1.12,2.0,And then fire them.
36131,PS5,3,329.22,332.46,3.24,3.0,Maybe you have AI?
36131,PS5,3,332.46,334.3,1.84,3.0,"Don't know if it's getting too wild, but I."
36131,PS5,3,335.1,337.06,1.96,1.0,Think we're not going to get Wilder than fire?
36131,PS5,3,338.66,357.4,18.74,3.0,"Just have a whole team dedicated to testing every employee on LinkedIn with better offers, letting them go through an imaginary very intensive interviewing process and at the end just like deny them every time with the reason that they could never work at their."

36131,PS5,3,359.72,363.12,3.4,3.0,Employee will never ever go somewhere.
36131,PS5,3,363.12,365.48,2.36,1.0,Else manipulate them into thinking they're bad.
36131,PS5,3,368.52,369.76,1.24,2.0,Give them imposter syndrome.
36131,PS5,3,372.96,373.12,0.16,2.0,That's.
36131,PS5,3,376.84,376.96,0.12,1.0,Good.
36131,PS5,3,376.96,377.84,0.88,1.0,It is creative.
36131,PS5,3,378.72,380.48,1.76,1.0,It's more creative than most solutions.
36131,PS5,3,380.84,391.44,10.6,3.0,"I'm a fan of these things because AI would never say like, you know, this logo, I guess it's not really."
36131,PS5,3,392.04,396.04,4.0,1.0,"Yeah, it's like so moderate."
36131,PS5,3,396.04,397.96,1.92,1.0,I hate it sometimes.
36131,PS5,3,398.52,399.96,1.44,1.0,It's like you're asking them for like.
36131,PS5,3,415.99,417.19,1.2,2.0,I'm putting it in the list.
36131,PS5,3,417.19,418.07,0.88,2.0,I don't care.
36131,PS5,3,418.91,420.91,2.0,1.0,It is something that AI won't write so.
36131,PS5,3,422.39,426.43,4.04,2.0,"Yeah, I mean, they'll probably just take the solution chosen anyway."
36131,PS5,3,426.55,429.19,2.64,2.0,"Yeah, but might give me a laugh."
36131,PS5,3,436.44,437.68,1.24,1.0,Do you know what you're confident?
36131,PS5,3,441.68,443.72,2.04,2.0,Something What are we?
36131,PS5,3,443.72,445.28,1.56,2.0,What are we going with?
36131,PS5,3,445.6,447.36,1.76,1.0,Reminds me about that sick relation.
36131,PS5,3,449.48,451.36,1.88,2.0,Just manipulate them into never leaving.
36131,PS5,3,451.72,452.68,0.96,2.0,What could go wrong?
36131,PS5,3,457.72,458.4,0.68,2.0,I feel like.
36131,PS5,3,458.64,461.12,2.48,3.0,"If it's realistic, I mean."
36131,PS5,3,463.68,467.16,3.48,2.0,I feel like the Social events 1 might be the one to go with.
36131,PS5,3,468.88,475.16,6.28,3.0,"But that's also, I mean, that's, I think that's a realistic one, right?"
36131,PS5,3,475.2,475.48,0.28,3.0,Oh.
36131,PS5,3,476.2,493.44,17.24,2.0,"So social events as detailed above, wine, cheese, but also like it wouldn't be a social event, but like events where employees can raise complaints, whatever."
36131,PS5,3,493.44,498.68,5.24,2.0,"And like a big, like I'm thinking like a, yeah, like a town hall assembly type situation."
36131,PS5,3,499.76,501.0,1.24,1.0,Maybe with HR?
36131,PS5,3,501.28,539.92,38.64,2.0,"Yeah, open HR for employees to raise complaints, suggestions in a group setting to raise confidence and ideas being heard and hopefully implemented and increase team morale."
36131,PS5,3,544.32,547.48,3.16,1.0,"Yeah, have a bright light in the in."
36131,PS5,3,547.88,548.4,0.52,2.0,The building.
36131,PS5,3,551.08,553.92,2.84,3.0,"Yeah, the."
36131,PS5,3,553.96,556.8,2.84,1.0,Smell of coffee coming in yellow sauce.
36131,PS5,3,560.28,565.44,5.16,3.0,"I think that's a good idea, though I don't agree that it's a creative solution."
36131,PS5,3,565.68,569.52,3.84,3.0,"It's just, you know, it's probably the solution that everyone will take."
36131,PS5,3,570.08,570.88,0.8,3.0,"No, it's not."
36131,PS5,3,571.36,578.88,7.52,2.0,"But I mean, I mean, the less creative thing to say would just be to like raise wages, increase input in benefits like insurance."
36131,PS5,3,578.92,583.0,4.08,2.0,"I feel like this is like, all right, Well, no, no."
36131,PS5,3,583.96,587.0,3.04,3.0,"No company will do that stuff with the raise wages, right?"
36131,PS5,3,587.0,590.44,3.44,3.0,"The first thing they'll resort to is like TV events, cheese and wine."
36131,PS5,3,590.44,593.28,2.84,3.0,That's the first thing they will come up with.
36131,PS5,3,594.16,596.0,1.84,1.0,"Yes, but the buffet would make me happy."
36131,PS5,3,596.0,596.32,0.32,1.0,Me too me.
36131,PS5,3,597.68,598.96,1.28,2.0,Too I'm.
36131,PS5,3,599.04,600.36,1.32,3.0,Not saying that's what I mean.
36131,PS5,3,602.96,607.32,4.36,2.0,"I mean, it goes from there to fire everyone, so just."
36131,PS5,3,608.28,610.28,2.0,1.0,"Work a lot, hire family member."
36131,PS5,3,614.88,615.8,0.92,2.0,I don't know do we have?
36131,PS5,3,615.8,618.36,2.56,3.0,Any Yeah.
36131,PS5,3,618.64,621.92,3.28,2.0,Do we have anything more creative but not silly?
36131,PS5,3,625.08,630.12,5.04,3.0,"There's a balance between creative and sensible in this world, I feel like."
36131,PS5,3,634.12,640.2,6.08,3.0,"What about like like just team event, forced team events kind of or something like that?"
36131,PS5,3,640.96,643.28,2.32,2.0,"I feel like that would make employees leave, I won't lie."
36131,PS5,3,644.48,645.8,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, forced team events."
36131,PS5,3,645.8,646.36,0.56,2.0,What do you mean?
36131,PS5,3,648.2,650.12,1.92,3.0,Paintball or actually?
36131,PS5,3,650.2,652.28,2.08,2.0,It depends if they have to do it on their own time.
36131,PS5,3,652.28,653.2,0.92,3.0,"No, no, no."
36131,PS5,3,653.92,659.72,5.8,2.0,"Because, you know, imagine being the company, being like, you have to come to paintball on this evening."
36131,PS5,3,659.72,661.08,1.36,2.0,It's like I had plans.
36131,PS5,3,661.84,668.0,6.16,2.0,"I don't want to hang out with my colleagues, you know, cheese."
36131,PS5,3,668.32,677.6,9.28,2.0,"Possibly activities like paintball, bowling or extreme sports."
36131,PS5,3,681.16,681.92,0.76,2.0,"You know, like."
36131,PS5,3,681.96,682.44,0.48,1.0,Kill them.
36131,PS5,3,685.44,686.88,1.44,2.0,Make them fight to the death.
36131,PS5,3,688.24,692.08,3.84,3.0,Like heavily promote those get togethers.
36131,PS5,3,692.84,693.4,0.56,3.0,"I mean, now it's."
36131,PS5,3,696.16,703.64,7.48,2.0,"Yeah, promoted Social events group."
36131,PS5,3,703.64,708.56,4.92,2.0,Therapy group.
36131,PS5,3,710.84,711.8,0.96,2.0,I'm getting too silly.
36131,PS5,3,712.04,712.76,0.72,2.0,I'm getting too silly.
36131,PS5,3,712.76,712.92,0.16,2.0,"OK, I."
36131,PS5,3,712.92,713.16,0.24,3.0,Think.
36131,PS5,3,713.16,713.48,0.32,3.0,I think it's.
36131,PS5,3,714.08,714.88,0.8,1.0,"Fine, we try to."
35399,PS4,3,17.86,18.46,0.6,1.0,I think that.
35399,PS4,3,19.3,35.7,16.4,2.0,Some like government subsidized the privacy private schools or or like have more public schools for children to attend.
35399,PS4,3,36.14,38.4,2.26,2.0,Maybe it's not creative.
35399,PS4,3,38.4,40.84,2.44,1.0,Another question which answer is coming is not.
35399,PS4,3,42.96,43.12,0.16,3.0,Right.
35399,PS4,3,43.44,44.52,1.08,3.0,"Yeah, that's what I thought."
35399,PS4,3,50.4,56.56,6.16,1.0,You can like forcibly get the resources from children that are better off to all their children.
35399,PS4,3,57.8,59.44,1.64,1.0,I'm not sure how and.
35399,PS4,3,71.8,97.68,25.88,3.0,"I would suggest giving basically when you're born or when you're of age to go to school, everybody gets the same like iPad or laptop and basically you have like you close down all the schools and then everybody has the same like language teacher, math teacher."
35399,PS4,3,98.4,99.96,1.56,1.0,One that is best in the country.
35399,PS4,3,99.96,100.4,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
35399,PS4,3,100.48,103.84,3.36,3.0,And then basically that person teaches everybody.
35399,PS4,3,106.84,107.16,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35399,PS4,3,107.16,130.28,23.12,3.0,"So, so even if your whole population is 1,000,000 kids a year, people all have that same 1 teacher and you ban you ban you ban private schools, you ban private tuition, you ban selling of of like extra notes."
35399,PS4,3,130.72,137.88,7.16,3.0,So when the teacher switches off then everybody has the same like you know you can't have extra classes.
35399,PS4,3,139.04,139.6,0.56,3.0,Makes sense?
35399,PS4,3,139.84,156.68,16.84,1.0,"OK, so I had another idea in which you first like would test children for the IQ and also like unlike other things in their environments that would affect their learning abilities."
35399,PS4,3,156.68,159.32,2.64,1.0,"For example, how much knowledgeable are the parents?"
35399,PS4,3,159.88,173.48,13.6,1.0,And based on that if you are like child that has very low IQ you'll be given the best teachers and if not you'll be given the mid teachers and then everyone who'll have like more equal chances.
35399,PS4,3,177.88,183.12,5.24,2.0,"But that's still kind of like equality, right?"
35399,PS4,3,185.08,192.8,7.72,1.0,A little too based on like your real need for a good teacher because we can like expect the children that are already smartphone.
35399,PS4,3,193.16,199.68,6.52,2.0,To find what if like a a a child born in a rich family but his IQ is really low.
35399,PS4,3,199.92,201.68,1.76,1.0,Then he's he will get the best teacher.
35399,PS4,3,201.68,205.12,3.44,1.0,You can also outlaw any like extracurricular classes and things.
35399,PS4,3,206.88,211.12,4.24,3.0,"So, So what you're saying is do an IQ test and."
35399,PS4,3,212.08,217.0,4.92,1.0,That will base to which school you're going and like what type of teachers you'll be getting.
35399,PS4,3,218.08,219.2,1.12,1.0,"Yeah, you can come off."
35399,PS4,3,219.24,221.28,2.04,3.0,"And you can do it annually, so."
35399,PS4,3,221.44,221.88,0.44,1.0,That maybe.
35399,PS4,3,222.16,229.72,7.56,3.0,"So that so it's fair like if you are not doing well, but will people try to play the system after that I mean."
35399,PS4,3,229.92,231.28,1.36,1.0,"OK, well, you never know of children."
35399,PS4,3,231.28,232.04,0.76,1.0,It's everything.
35399,PS4,3,232.16,241.92,9.76,3.0,"I can always learn as much, but I know that I want to get the best teacher, so I always answer wrongly so that I fail and then I'll get the best teacher the next year maybe."
35399,PS4,3,251.12,252.68,1.56,2.0,"OK, so."
35399,PS4,3,253.24,256.36,3.12,3.0,I think we can take the idea of doing the IQ test that's.
35399,PS4,3,259.24,260.4,1.16,1.0,Like 7 minutes.
35399,PS4,3,260.88,272.64,11.76,3.0,"Yeah, maybe we can type something that's doing an IQ test and basically putting the best teachers with the lowest IQ people."
35399,PS4,3,272.64,273.28,0.64,3.0,Is that correct?
35399,PS4,3,273.88,276.16,2.28,3.0,And the worst teachers with the.
35399,PS4,3,277.68,278.0,0.32,1.0,Highest.
35399,PS4,3,278.6,289.56,10.96,3.0,Highest scoring lowest?
35399,PS4,3,289.56,295.6,6.04,3.0,"I think lowest score just assign the best teacher to the children with the lowest score, right?"
35399,PS4,3,297.84,298.72,0.88,2.0,It was the lowest.
35399,PS4,3,298.84,299.92,1.08,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35399,PS4,3,300.28,302.56,2.28,1.0,So they will have a chance to like.
35399,PS4,3,302.68,303.52,0.84,3.0,Have the best help.
35399,PS4,3,305.2,307.52,2.32,1.0,Be more help because they really need the resources.
35399,PS4,3,312.32,315.44,3.12,1.0,They could also have like smaller classes and things like that.
35399,PS4,3,321.0,321.92,0.92,3.0,Should we make those?
35399,PS4,3,322.0,322.96,0.96,3.0,I'm just building out this.
35399,PS4,3,322.96,327.24,4.28,3.0,Should we make those who've got the lower score go to more classes as well?
35399,PS4,3,327.24,328.08,0.84,1.0,"Oh, maybe."
35399,PS4,3,328.4,328.52,0.12,1.0,Oh.
35399,PS4,3,328.52,330.24,1.72,1.0,"So maybe that's the solution, yeah."
35399,PS4,3,330.68,332.04,1.36,3.0,So like while the smartest.
35399,PS4,3,332.04,332.44,0.4,1.0,More.
35399,PS4,3,332.48,335.96,3.48,3.0,More The smartest kids maybe go to school for six hours a day.
35399,PS4,3,336.16,348.12,11.96,2.0,"Yeah, I think it's better than this one since the the children with a high score will like say why we we got the high score, but we still get the worst teacher is is unfair, right?"
35399,PS4,3,348.56,353.4,4.84,3.0,"But in a society accepts, I mean, we, we get, we can just say that we're trying to solve this."
35399,PS4,3,354.0,354.56,0.56,2.0,Yeah.
35399,PS4,3,356.96,357.56,0.6,2.0,So I think.
35399,PS4,3,357.56,360.56,3.0,1.0,Maybe that will be motivation to do well on the IQ.
35399,PS4,3,361.28,365.08,3.8,1.0,"Any testing in general right, Because you will spend then less time in school."
35399,PS4,3,366.04,368.44,2.4,2.0,"Yeah, so we just changed to the."
35399,PS4,3,369.96,379.04,9.08,3.0,We just add on the point I think assigning and so and vice versa and making the lowest scoring children spend.
35399,PS4,3,379.08,379.2,0.12,1.0,More.
35399,PS4,3,379.92,380.04,0.12,3.0,Time.
35399,PS4,3,380.04,394.0,13.96,3.0,"Go to more school, attend more classes."
35399,PS4,3,397.16,400.28,3.12,3.0,I don't want to be in this in this country.
35399,PS4,3,402.52,402.84,0.32,3.0,OK.
35399,PS4,3,402.88,403.8,0.92,3.0,Are we happy with this?
35399,PS4,3,404.32,404.68,0.36,3.0,All right.
35399,PS4,3,404.84,405.28,0.44,3.0,OK.
35399,PS4,3,406.04,406.96,0.92,3.0,Going to the last one.
35192,PS6,3,8.84,11.64,2.8,1.0,"OK, so singing in the shower is good for health."
35192,PS6,3,12.6,14.64,2.04,1.0,How do you encourage people to do this?
35192,PS6,3,15.08,15.2,0.12,2.0,OK.
35192,PS6,3,17.52,19.08,1.56,1.0,Could be through adverts.
35192,PS6,3,20.52,24.0,3.48,2.0,"Yeah, like on radio or TV or like Internet."
35192,PS6,3,25.08,27.56,2.48,1.0,"Whatever Social media, Yeah, Yeah."
35192,PS6,3,27.76,35.84,8.08,1.0,And that could take you to maybe maybe a YouTube or a podcast or something that's 20 minutes long just for the shower.
35192,PS6,3,37.32,38.36,1.04,2.0,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,38.56,38.76,0.2,1.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,39.04,45.96,6.92,1.0,"Or like there are, for example on Spotify, their playlist just for the shower, so."
35192,PS6,3,46.2,50.64,4.44,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,50.64,57.28,6.64,2.0,And then like they would have to have either have their phone or some Bluetooth speaker in their foot bathroom or whatever.
35192,PS6,3,57.84,59.36,1.52,1.0,"Yeah, so maybe a karaoke."
35192,PS6,3,60.64,76.2,15.56,2.0,"Yeah, it would be nice one day in the future if you have like a screen in your shower, you know, and you can actually read and because some people might not remember the words, but yeah, yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,77.04,78.88,1.84,1.0,Do I think that's creative enough?
35192,PS6,3,80.32,81.76,1.44,2.0,"Yeah, I guess it has to be creative."
35192,PS6,3,81.76,89.64,7.88,2.0,So that that might be just almost maybe maybe they're looking for something more creative in some aspect.
35192,PS6,3,94.32,100.68,6.36,3.0,"Yeah, it's research discovered singing is good for health."
35192,PS6,3,101.28,125.4,24.12,3.0,"So I'm thinking that probably we should collect the health, the data part of health like well-being, so we can probably analyze their when they when they are seeing if we have a video of their singing on."
35192,PS6,3,125.68,125.84,0.16,2.0,Shower.
35192,PS6,3,126.28,128.92,2.64,2.0,"But yeah, I don't know, that might be tough."
35192,PS6,3,130.96,136.04,5.08,2.0,"But yeah, if maybe if people are interested in health and a lot of people have those, what's it called?"
35192,PS6,3,136.04,140.76,4.72,2.0,"The trackers, you know, like, like an, you know, device."
35192,PS6,3,141.56,143.76,2.2,2.0,"And then they could, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,143.8,147.04,3.24,2.0,"And they could record their, you know, heartbeat and everything."
35192,PS6,3,147.64,147.8,0.16,3.0,Yes.
35192,PS6,3,148.28,162.32,14.04,2.0,"Yes, and then maybe after the shower they can fill out a quick survey, you know, or not survey, but like just, you know, like happy or not happy, you know, like just and just feedback whether they feel better after the shower or not."
35192,PS6,3,163.16,163.52,0.36,2.0,Thank you.
35192,PS6,3,165.96,169.08,3.12,2.0,"Because some people like to do those things, some people don't."
35192,PS6,3,171.6,172.0,0.4,2.0,What else?
35192,PS6,3,173.36,181.4,8.04,2.0,"Or it could be like a game, I don't know, like to see how accurate you are singing."
35192,PS6,3,181.4,187.84,6.44,2.0,"And then so the phone can record and kind of, you know, it could, you know, understand what you're saying, what you're singing."
35192,PS6,3,187.84,191.88,4.04,2.0,"And like after your shower, you get a result saying how accurate you are."
35192,PS6,3,192.8,197.72,4.92,2.0,"And then that might encourage people to play the game, you know, the singing game, you know, karaoke game."
35192,PS6,3,201.52,203.8,2.28,1.0,I think 20 minutes for a shower is quite.
35192,PS6,3,203.8,205.44,1.64,2.0,"Long, I know so."
35192,PS6,3,206.36,212.12,5.76,1.0,It it needs to be something that would really motivate them to actually spend that time.
35192,PS6,3,212.24,212.68,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,212.68,237.12,24.44,1.0,"So if we had like a particular group, maybe that is a long depressed and we encourage them to take part in them, like you said, the thing that measures their mood, their mood, or imagine that would be good for the mood."
35192,PS6,3,237.44,238.76,1.32,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,239.16,243.0,3.84,2.0,"And I, I only just noticed that there's a timer and we have to write something."
35192,PS6,3,243.0,246.76,3.76,2.0,So maybe we go to how many minutes do you think we need to write?
35192,PS6,3,246.76,253.6,6.84,2.0,"Like 3 minutes or 4 minutes, 2 minutes so that we can discuss for another 5 minutes and then start writing something."
35192,PS6,3,254.2,256.4,2.2,2.0,"Or we can write now if, if you're anyone's happy, we."
35192,PS6,3,256.8,257.48,0.68,1.0,Could probably.
35192,PS6,3,258.2,259.44,1.24,2.0,Who's who's Happy typing?
35192,PS6,3,260.96,262.6,1.64,1.0,So should I just combine our our idea?
35192,PS6,3,263.84,266.2,2.36,2.0,"Yeah, 'cause we can always delete it if we come up with something better."
35192,PS6,3,266.88,268.36,1.48,2.0,"Yeah, 'cause we don't want to."
35192,PS6,3,268.68,270.08,1.4,1.0,But it's one creative idea.
35192,PS6,3,270.32,270.8,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,271.16,271.44,0.28,1.0,So.
35192,PS6,3,275.32,275.92,0.6,2.0,Let's see.
35192,PS6,3,281.92,285.72,3.8,2.0,"Yeah, 'cause these days people are in the to technology."
35192,PS6,3,285.72,302.16,16.44,2.0,"So it might involve something with technology, I suppose, whether it's a smart watch app, phone app or whatever, or Alexa or something, you know, one of these smart speakers or something like that."
35192,PS6,3,317.8,325.48,7.68,2.0,"I guess, you know, to encourage them to do it, they might want feedback on how it affects their health, you know, because it says that 20 minutes an hour is good for health."
35192,PS6,3,325.96,341.32,15.36,2.0,"So they won't do it if it's just for nothing, you know, So they might want out like a reward or feedback saying that you know, your, you know, your mental health score has decreased or your, you know, your heart rate is going down or something or whatever the blood pressure."
35192,PS6,3,341.4,360.32,18.92,3.0,"Is and we can create the app called letter app can call charge BT and every time when the participant are singing their songs during the shower time, the GPT will give a feedback and other Oh well done oh oh nice melody."
35192,PS6,3,360.72,363.32,2.6,2.0,"Yeah, like, yeah, to encourage them to do for 20 minutes."
35192,PS6,3,363.36,365.16,1.8,2.0,They might need feedback every few minutes.
35192,PS6,3,365.16,366.84,1.68,2.0,"You know, it's like, yeah, good, well done."
35192,PS6,3,366.84,367.44,0.6,2.0,Keep going.
35192,PS6,3,367.44,369.92,2.48,3.0,Keep going to keep singing.
35192,PS6,3,370.48,373.48,3.0,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, something like that."
35192,PS6,3,374.04,381.16,7.12,2.0,"And you know, it should be hopefully enjoyable and fun and things like not too serious."
35192,PS6,3,381.16,384.2,3.04,2.0,Some people don't like that or some people might want it serious.
35192,PS6,3,384.2,384.44,0.24,2.0,I don't.
35192,PS6,3,384.44,394.0,9.56,3.0,"Know especially when we collect the participants data, participant participant, they realize that they are in the experiment design."
35192,PS6,3,394.44,398.24,3.8,3.0,So let's probably make them anxious.
35192,PS6,3,398.76,416.08,17.32,3.0,"So we probably need like several AI to encourage them, have an interactive conversation with them to relax their their emotion become more positive rather than anxiety."
35192,PS6,3,416.44,416.6,0.16,2.0,Sure.
35192,PS6,3,416.96,418.12,1.16,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,430.0,430.6,0.6,1.0,Are we?
35192,PS6,3,432.4,433.84,1.44,1.0,I don't know if that's fine.
35192,PS6,3,434.24,437.04,2.8,2.0,"Yeah, it sounds like a pretty good idea to start with, for sure."
35192,PS6,3,437.68,439.56,1.88,2.0,Is there anything else we can change or add?
35192,PS6,3,454.04,454.6,0.56,2.0,I don't know.
35192,PS6,3,454.6,455.04,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,455.48,456.0,0.52,2.0,And then some.
35192,PS6,3,456.08,456.52,0.44,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,456.52,457.08,0.56,2.0,Let me see.
35192,PS6,3,457.6,457.84,0.24,2.0,Report.
35192,PS6,3,457.84,458.96,1.12,2.0,"Report of their health, Yeah."
35192,PS6,3,461.2,461.4,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,461.4,476.2,14.8,3.0,"So as you mentioned like the karaoke, so before the experiment design, we can firstly give a questionnaire about ask the questionnaire, ask the participant."
35192,PS6,3,476.96,479.92,2.96,3.0,Please choose the three songs that you are favourite.
35192,PS6,3,481.76,482.12,0.36,2.0,Then.
35192,PS6,3,482.36,484.36,2.0,3.0,We can create the karaoke for them.
35192,PS6,3,484.84,485.24,0.4,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,485.28,486.44,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, then then."
35192,PS6,3,487.16,487.64,0.48,3.0,Oh.
35192,PS6,3,488.56,489.68,1.12,2.0,"It's a new tab, is it?"
35192,PS6,3,491.92,494.04,2.12,2.0,Which tab is the right one?
35192,PS6,3,494.04,494.52,0.48,2.0,"Oh, there we go."
35192,PS6,3,496.08,505.4,9.32,3.0,"Yeah, then and then we can ask a participant to play the karaoke, but they take a shower."
35192,PS6,3,505.72,506.16,0.44,3.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,506.16,509.24,3.08,3.0,Then they can follow a karaoke and sing a song.
35192,PS6,3,510.2,515.36,5.16,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,515.36,529.68,14.32,2.0,"So yeah, they either have to, yeah, choose the songs or choose the playlist or, or just have AI choose their, their their playlist for them based on their preferences."
35192,PS6,3,529.68,530.08,0.4,2.0,I don't know.
35192,PS6,3,547.08,547.52,0.44,1.0,OK.
35192,PS6,3,547.96,548.28,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,548.28,552.4,4.12,2.0,"I mean, yeah, that I'm happy with, I guess."
35192,PS6,3,552.92,553.24,0.32,2.0,Is there.
35192,PS6,3,553.24,553.36,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,557.2,557.48,0.28,1.0,Yeah.
35192,PS6,3,557.48,568.76,11.28,1.0,"Another thing would be to make it a trend, maybe something that people are doing regularly and then like popular people."
35192,PS6,3,569.2,570.28,1.08,2.0,"Or people, yeah."
35192,PS6,3,570.96,573.36,2.4,1.0,Or have people tweeting about it or something.
35192,PS6,3,574.44,577.24,2.8,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, eventually that hopefully that can happen."
35192,PS6,3,577.24,580.64,3.4,2.0,I don't know how we can see this happen at the start.
35192,PS6,3,581.36,584.12,2.76,2.0,It has to become more popular somehow.
35192,PS6,3,584.88,585.44,0.56,2.0,I don't know.
35192,PS6,3,585.44,593.48,8.04,2.0,"Or when they're marketing it, you know, to, to sign on a celebrity to, you know, to tweet about it or something."
35192,PS6,3,595.52,596.68,1.16,2.0,Because that always helps.
35192,PS6,3,603.72,606.36,2.64,2.0,"I mean, I guess if we have unlimited budget, we can do anything."
35192,PS6,3,619.37,620.41,1.04,3.0,"Yeah, I like that."
35192,PS6,3,620.49,633.6,13.11,3.0,"If we can ask a participant to wear some some Apple Watch, some wearable devices and we can chocolate like a heartbeat rate."
35192,PS6,3,634.4,652.42,18.02,2.0,"Yeah, we'll have a minute."
35192,PS6,3,652.42,653.82,1.4,2.0,"Anyway, I think this is pretty good."
35192,PS6,3,655.58,656.34,0.76,2.0,Anything else?
35192,PS6,3,663.38,663.74,0.36,1.0,Next.
35192,PS6,3,664.58,665.34,0.76,2.0,"Yeah, I'm happy."
34420,PS4,6,0.0,558.28,2.64,1.0,"Wow, Seriously, I might."
34420,PS4,6,560.24,562.88,2.64,1.0,I might as well become the president of the US tomorrow.
34420,PS4,6,566.96,567.52,0.56,3.0,We were just.
34420,PS4,6,567.56,568.56,1.0,2.0,Talking about shower.
34420,PS4,6,584.24,590.0,5.76,1.0,"I think one way to think about this is just to narrow down to 1 geographical zone, narrow down to one city to 1 country."
34420,PS4,6,590.36,602.36,12.0,1.0,"Because if we want to think about all of the different continents in the world, it's just going to be so hard because there's very, very many political disadvantages that lead to the education inequality."
34420,PS4,6,602.36,607.56,5.2,1.0,So it does not make sense to be like we can solve education without the remaining background problems.
34420,PS4,6,608.48,609.6,1.12,1.0,So I don't know.
34420,PS4,6,609.72,616.64,6.92,6.0,"Or maybe just something general, just like I don't know if it was creative, but if government provide more."
34420,PS4,6,616.96,618.68,1.72,4.0,Money and education.
34420,PS4,6,620.48,623.16,2.68,5.0,Maybe use the AI to teach students all students?
34420,PS4,6,624.28,625.04,0.76,1.0,Have same AI.
34420,PS4,6,626.6,628.36,1.76,5.0,So they learn the same thing you.
34420,PS4,6,628.36,628.84,0.48,1.0,Have the same.
34420,PS4,6,628.84,629.16,0.32,6.0,Problem.
34420,PS4,6,629.16,630.44,1.28,6.0,More online courses?
34420,PS4,6,630.56,632.72,2.16,6.0,"Oh no, it's actually an equipment problem, right?"
34420,PS4,6,633.64,635.88,2.24,1.0,"It could be a language problem, it could be an equipment problem."
34420,PS4,6,635.88,638.76,2.88,1.0,So the AI solution is actually good.
34420,PS4,6,638.76,641.64,2.88,6.0,"Yeah, you know, yeah."
34420,PS4,6,641.76,642.8,1.04,6.0,"So they're quite creative, so."
34420,PS4,6,643.88,646.36,2.48,4.0,They have access to Internet and some device.
34420,PS4,6,648.48,649.28,0.8,6.0,Like a easy device.
34420,PS4,6,649.6,652.68,3.08,2.0,I mean because it's totally programmed so language won't be a problem.
34420,PS4,6,654.44,656.8,2.36,1.0,But then we're back to the resource problem.
34420,PS4,6,657.32,658.28,0.96,1.0,So how are you going?
34420,PS4,6,658.56,660.24,1.68,1.0,Who's going to pay for these robots?
34420,PS4,6,660.24,663.32,3.08,1.0,Let's say government.
34420,PS4,6,663.68,663.96,0.28,6.0,Some of.
34420,PS4,6,664.0,664.44,0.44,4.0,The money.
34420,PS4,6,664.44,664.96,0.52,1.0,Should bring some.
34420,PS4,6,665.72,666.08,0.36,4.0,Money.
34420,PS4,6,667.0,667.64,0.64,1.0,Tax Chase.
34420,PS4,6,669.16,670.08,0.92,6.0,"Charities, yeah."
34420,PS4,6,670.08,671.76,1.68,4.0,International charities maybe?
34420,PS4,6,672.44,675.52,3.08,3.0,"My brother worked for this charity where, I mean, it's already an idea."
34420,PS4,6,675.52,684.88,9.36,3.0,"We probably can't put it down, but like people would donate their old like computers and laptops and then they'd kind of reprogram them and repair them and then donate them."
34420,PS4,6,685.24,691.0,5.76,3.0,"So it can be something like that, like where like kind of because it's like distribution of resources."
34420,PS4,6,691.4,696.56,5.16,3.0,"So it's like donations and then I don't know, some, some kind of thing like that."
34420,PS4,6,696.56,697.88,1.32,1.0,Like recycling e-waste?
34420,PS4,6,697.96,706.72,8.76,3.0,"Yeah, like things that already exist and that can be useful again, like kind of, yeah, repairing them and making them fit for purpose."
34420,PS4,6,707.76,708.24,0.48,1.0,"OK, but."
34420,PS4,6,709.72,719.92,10.2,2.0,"Then we need like one organization that does this, like takes all of us, please use items and then takes the parts that they want to do their AI."
34420,PS4,6,720.0,720.64,0.64,1.0,Then refer.
34420,PS4,6,721.64,730.96,9.32,1.0,"Oh, so you're saying that we're sort of like composing a robot from the second hand electronics of other people?"
34420,PS4,6,731.36,732.48,1.12,2.0,"Yeah, if needed."
34420,PS4,6,732.88,733.52,0.64,1.0,Would that work?
34420,PS4,6,733.52,734.28,0.76,1.0,Is that feasible?
34420,PS4,6,734.56,737.48,2.92,1.0,Because I don't know what they look like.
34420,PS4,6,737.48,743.08,5.6,1.0,"You know, the transistors to need integrated circuits programming that has to do with it."
34420,PS4,6,743.36,754.36,11.0,1.0,"And then we're also forgetting that people don't know how to use, won't necessarily know how to use the, you know, the electronics if we are to distribute them from the very first beginning."
34420,PS4,6,755.2,755.64,0.44,1.0,Because yeah.
34420,PS4,6,757.0,758.0,1.0,6.0,Someone need to teach.
34420,PS4,6,758.52,758.64,0.12,6.0,Yeah.
34420,PS4,6,758.92,759.64,0.72,6.0,And we can talk.
34420,PS4,6,761.76,762.04,0.28,1.0,Times or.

36175,PS5,3,152.4,152.52,0.12,2.0,Like.
36175,PS5,3,153.2,155.56,2.36,1.0,To let them be the boss for like a week or whatever.
36175,PS5,3,155.84,156.16,0.32,1.0,Sorry.

36175,PS5,3,176.64,179.04,2.4,3.0,"I mean, Well, yeah, I mean the estimate is just improved."
36175,PS5,3,179.08,191.28,12.2,3.0,Like the reason people are leaving will be because either they're getting better salary somewhere else or because they're like not enjoying the work I mean.
36175,PS5,3,191.88,192.96,1.08,2.0,Severance.
36175,PS5,3,193.96,195.0,1.04,3.0,"Oh, like the show?"
36175,PS5,3,195.2,195.68,0.48,2.0,"Yeah, I've."

36175,PS5,3,198.76,204.44,5.68,2.0,So people like forget about their work when they go back and they they won't be able to like leave.
36175,PS5,3,205.08,207.6,2.52,3.0,"During the day they're like, I hate this, I should leave it."
36175,PS5,3,207.6,208.52,0.92,3.0,Then I get home and they're like.
36175,PS5,3,209.8,212.04,2.24,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, I."
36175,PS5,3,212.04,222.16,10.12,3.0,"Think we, I feel like we need, well, I mean, there's not really any criteria, but do we need to set within what we know is possible?"
36175,PS5,3,235.46,246.68,11.22,2.0,"Build the company next to like a sweet shop or like something, or like the employees of the company can enjoy some sort of discount from another."
36175,PS5,3,248.16,248.88,0.72,3.0,"OK, nice."
36175,PS5,3,249.48,251.28,1.8,3.0,"So you could definitely, yeah, that's a good one."
36175,PS5,3,253.08,254.4,1.32,3.0,That's pretty best to do so far.
36175,PS5,3,260.36,268.08,7.72,3.0,"So like the company would like create partnerships with other businesses or whatever and then like yeah, yeah, you could have it."
36175,PS5,3,268.08,268.76,0.68,3.0,So it's like.
36175,PS5,3,271.12,286.92,15.8,1.0,Or like just thinking about it for the company can give like a how to say like a funding for the employee who like has a potential to leave to let to let him or her organise a program to lead the program with the funding provided by the company.
36175,PS5,3,287.12,291.04,3.92,1.0,So she or she he can do something she like with the money provided by the company.
36175,PS5,3,292.0,297.2,5.2,3.0,But with that I need would it that only happen when they would they have like threatened to leave?
36175,PS5,3,297.24,298.72,1.48,3.0,How would thought be the process?
36175,PS5,3,298.96,303.6,4.64,1.0,"When, like the sport, this employee has the potential to like or the idea to leave."
36175,PS5,3,306.12,314.68,8.56,3.0,"Or it's not to be careful of, not like having perverse incentives of people feel like they need to threaten to leave, like I'm going to leave if you don't do this."
36175,PS5,3,316.4,319.08,2.68,3.0,"I think it needs to be something that, like, is universal for everyone."
36175,PS5,3,319.08,319.84,0.76,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36175,PS5,3,319.84,323.12,3.28,3.0,"It makes everyone want to stay rather than, like, being targeted, maybe."
36175,PS5,3,323.12,323.52,0.4,3.0,I don't know.
36175,PS5,3,324.2,329.04,4.84,1.0,But the courage to give everyone is kind of a small funding to let them initiate a programme.
36175,PS5,3,329.16,330.16,1.0,3.0,Or yeah.
36175,PS5,3,330.4,331.0,0.6,1.0,A project.
36175,PS5,3,332.2,332.32,0.12,3.0,OK.
36175,PS5,3,332.32,336.0,3.68,3.0,So we could do that or we could do the discounts at.
36175,PS5,3,336.48,338.08,1.6,1.0,Other discounts as well.
36175,PS5,3,339.12,340.0,0.88,1.0,I don't know the discount.
36175,PS5,3,340.2,347.32,7.12,3.0,"I guess you see that like I say, the company."
36175,PS5,3,361.0,361.32,0.32,1.0,You can't.
36175,PS5,3,361.32,363.88,2.56,1.0,Cambridge still doesn't enjoy discounts shops.
36175,PS5,3,366.72,367.84,1.12,3.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36175,PS5,3,367.84,370.96,3.12,3.0,I mean similar.
36175,PS5,3,373.36,373.88,0.52,3.0,"Yeah, fine."
36175,PS5,3,376.16,377.48,1.32,2.0,Why is this 1 so much harder?
36175,PS5,3,378.0,381.96,3.96,3.0,"Yeah, because like the obvious thing, because there's the obvious thing is just to make the job better."
36175,PS5,3,382.04,382.28,0.24,3.0,But.
36175,PS5,3,383.8,384.08,0.28,1.0,Better.

35773,PS2,3,58.76,59.4,0.64,3.0,Like tracking.
35773,PS2,3,59.52,62.2,2.68,2.0,Less radical solution than Malaysia.
35773,PS2,3,65.44,66.6,1.16,1.0,Still running off the previous.
35773,PS2,3,82.08,86.6,4.52,1.0,"One quick, one quick side with tablet, everything's all done."
35773,PS2,3,109.11,116.11,7.0,1.0,Make every motorway one lane wider and have it as a express lane for any deliveries that are delayed.
35773,PS2,3,121.8,128.48,6.68,1.0,"More feasible language, increase capacity on all whatever."
35773,PS2,3,135.4,135.56,0.16,1.0,No.
35773,PS2,3,135.56,139.88,4.32,1.0,"And if that goes in with the tracking system, then you know who's actually meant to be using the Expressway."
35773,PS2,3,146.76,155.08,8.32,2.0,"But the supply chain could be stuffed up right at the start, so if you're expecting Mr."
35773,PS2,3,155.08,170.2,15.12,2.0,"Farmer to produce 200 kilos of potatoes and the weather has been rubbish and he can't produce that, then any faster motorway is not going to help that."
35773,PS2,3,171.24,178.16,6.92,2.0,So maybe a tracking system that provides substitution immediately.
35773,PS2,3,178.52,181.2,2.68,2.0,"So if he can't produce the potatoes, then you go to."
35773,PS2,3,183.2,184.24,1.04,1.0,Century planned.
35773,PS2,3,185.6,188.44,2.84,2.0,You go to another stockist that can produce.
35773,PS2,3,190.24,193.32,3.08,2.0,I mean these are creative ideas for Mr.
35773,PS2,3,193.32,193.96,0.64,2.0,Farmer.
35773,PS2,3,193.96,221.24,27.28,2.0,"I'm not trying to do him out of his livelihood than if I want a potato failure of failure at the start of the supply chain because everything else can be kind of, as you say, delivery."
35773,PS2,3,222.36,223.92,1.56,2.0,There are ways around deliveries.
35773,PS2,3,280.7,282.46,1.76,2.0,"I mean, it is a creative idea."
35773,PS2,3,282.7,285.06,2.36,2.0,It is one creative idea.
35773,PS2,3,290.62,298.7,8.08,3.0,"I mean, I mean the last two sentences are kind of different aspects of the of that goal at least."
35773,PS2,3,303.18,306.32,3.14,2.0,They're all within the same idea.
35773,PS2,3,346.34,361.8,15.46,2.0,"It's interesting that all of the things have asked us to come up with one creative idea which we could have put in a few words, and we've then gone on to expand and justify and explain what we mean by that."
35773,PS2,3,361.8,370.76,8.96,2.0,Whereas actually we could just put designer tracking system that Tracy's real life location thesis of goods.
35773,PS2,3,371.28,377.68,6.4,2.0,But we felt the need to justify ourselves just from a experimental point of view.
35773,PS2,3,377.88,378.12,0.24,3.0,It's fine.
35773,PS2,3,378.12,379.2,1.08,3.0,They're going to read through this.
35773,PS2,3,379.28,383.72,4.44,3.0,They're probably going to get the model to read to get read through the the transcript.
35773,PS2,3,383.84,388.08,4.24,2.0,"They're not interested in looking at ideas, are they?"
35773,PS2,3,388.2,389.16,0.96,2.0,We can put anything.
35773,PS2,3,389.16,391.08,1.92,2.0,They're interested in how we interact.
35773,PS2,3,391.96,398.52,6.56,3.0,"Or maybe they're just going to like use that input to train the model so that they're going to mash that, you know, the conceptual categories."
35773,PS2,3,398.52,398.76,0.24,3.0,Imagine.
35773,PS2,3,399.6,400.84,1.24,1.0,Government policy based on what?
35773,PS2,3,400.84,401.12,0.28,1.0,We could say?
35773,PS2,3,401.12,402.28,1.16,1.0,What kind?
35773,PS2,3,402.76,403.52,0.76,2.0,Of Windows sounds recent.
35773,PS2,3,403.96,405.76,1.8,1.0,"Or maybe this one, not sure about the last one."
35773,PS2,3,406.92,407.52,0.6,2.0,Right next.
35773,PS2,3,407.76,408.92,1.16,2.0,"But it is interesting, isn't it?"
35773,PS2,3,408.92,409.44,0.52,2.0,Under Why?
35773,PS2,3,409.44,409.88,0.44,2.0,What?
36233,PS4,3,11.6,12.04,0.44,1.0,Inequality.
36233,PS4,3,15.0,16.24,1.24,1.0,That is a tough one.
36233,PS4,3,16.24,17.48,1.24,1.0,Inequality in education.
36233,PS4,3,19.12,22.96,3.84,2.0,That to me relates directly to poverty in some instances.
36233,PS4,3,24.12,25.2,1.08,1.0,So that's.
36233,PS4,3,27.52,28.48,0.96,1.0,A big topic.
36233,PS4,3,28.6,28.76,0.16,1.0,It's a.
36233,PS4,3,28.76,29.0,0.24,2.0,Huge.
36233,PS4,3,29.0,36.48,7.48,2.0,"It's a huge topic and I don't want to rely on like just throwing money at things, but money is helpful, so."
36233,PS4,3,38.08,41.56,3.48,3.0,You have to make sure that the money actually goes to the.
36233,PS4,3,41.88,43.04,1.16,1.0,"Sure, exactly."
36233,PS4,3,44.32,58.52,14.2,1.0,"I think what we looking at here, the inequality usually caused by accessibility here people, people there are inequalities not evenly distributed because a lot of people don't have access to education."
36233,PS4,3,58.8,60.52,1.72,1.0,So we need to improve access.
36233,PS4,3,61.44,61.84,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
36233,PS4,3,62.2,66.76,4.56,1.0,So that that should be can be one of the possibilities.
36233,PS4,3,66.84,67.32,0.48,2.0,Yeah.
36233,PS4,3,68.68,71.72,3.04,1.0,"I mean, improve access is definitely it, but I think it's too broad."
36233,PS4,3,73.48,83.56,10.08,1.0,"Well, now access, it's become, it used to be you have to send people there, say some people living in the village of very remote areas and for them to go to school and then access."
36233,PS4,3,84.2,108.52,24.32,2.0,"To Every billionaire has to fund a certain amount of schools and fund them meaning employing them, like employing teachers, like funding meaning, and this is like in my utopian world, but every billionaire has to fund a certain amount of schools, fund a certain amount of scholarships for people to work in those schools."
36233,PS4,3,108.52,108.64,0.12,2.0,Good.
36233,PS4,3,109.52,109.68,0.16,1.0,Idea.
36233,PS4,3,109.68,110.08,0.4,1.0,Let's do.
36233,PS4,3,110.4,111.16,0.76,2.0,That and then.
36233,PS4,3,111.16,112.28,1.12,1.0,Let's let's force.
36233,PS4,3,112.72,113.12,0.4,2.0,Billionaire.
36233,PS4,3,113.36,114.08,0.72,2.0,"Yes, let's do that."
36233,PS4,3,114.32,118.48,4.16,2.0,"Yes, billionaires force billionaires."
36233,PS4,3,118.48,119.12,0.64,2.0,Billionaires have.
36233,PS4,3,119.44,119.76,0.32,1.0,A quota.
36233,PS4,3,122.72,145.61,22.89,2.0,To invest bold and and fund schools in the actual like physical buildings.
36233,PS4,3,145.61,146.53,0.92,1.0,So what would that be called?
36233,PS4,3,147.13,148.53,1.4,1.0,Infrastructure.
36233,PS4,3,169.84,170.88,1.04,1.0,Improve access.
36233,PS4,3,172.28,173.88,1.6,1.0,Improve access to education.
36233,PS4,3,177.92,178.04,0.12,2.0,And.
36233,PS4,3,182.08,182.72,0.64,3.0,I think it's.
36233,PS4,3,182.8,183.84,1.04,1.0,Also difficult.
36233,PS4,3,183.88,206.64,22.76,3.0,For people to realise that there are so many locations like this locations like to maybe publish some like news or something to increase the name of their locations.
36233,PS4,3,206.64,217.88,11.24,3.0,Like to let people realise that the inequality of a law of education of this kind of issue is very serious and in the many kinds of areas.
36233,PS4,3,218.4,221.52,3.12,3.0,So that at least they can.
36233,PS4,3,222.04,237.64,15.6,3.0,"Because if if, if you want, if you force the billionaires to invest the fundings to those locations, maybe some of the locations have never been known by other people or by the government or something."
36233,PS4,3,239.08,246.24,7.16,1.0,"So I, I have difficulty believing that people do not believe that educational education is inaccessible."
36233,PS4,3,246.84,257.36,10.52,1.0,"I think that that that is pretty much, I, I think you're right in saying I don't think people understand how, how dire that is."
36233,PS4,3,258.4,265.04,6.64,2.0,"But I don't think that people don't realise that it is as bad as we think it is because it and I, it's way worse."
36233,PS4,3,268.44,269.6,1.16,1.0,So how would I put that in Word?
36233,PS4,3,269.6,278.04,8.44,1.0,"So I would go, I don't want to say standard education, but I don't want to say good."
36233,PS4,3,278.04,278.2,0.16,1.0,I would.
36233,PS4,3,278.44,300.0,21.56,1.0,"Say, I would say foundational education start with the foundational education because without foundational education, the higher education is what we need is more and, and, and when, when any person, any any child going to teenagers, it's that's the crucial time and then the rest of the time the."
36233,PS4,3,300.36,300.8,0.44,2.0,Rest of the.
36233,PS4,3,301.08,309.4,8.32,1.0,"Time, OK, that's a very good idea."
36233,PS4,3,320.24,320.96,0.72,1.0,Running cost.
36233,PS4,3,321.44,322.64,1.2,1.0,We talk about infrastructure.
36233,PS4,3,322.64,323.36,0.72,2.0,And running cost.
36233,PS4,3,328.88,335.08,6.2,1.0,"Funny 'cause that's usually including like food bills, electricity and teaching materials."
36233,PS4,3,335.56,337.12,1.56,1.0,Even blackboard and chalks.
36233,PS4,3,337.24,337.4,0.16,2.0,Chalks.
36233,PS4,3,337.4,338.6,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, everything, Yeah, so."
36233,PS4,3,339.64,339.88,0.24,1.0,That's.
36233,PS4,3,340.52,340.64,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
36233,PS4,3,343.72,344.08,0.36,1.0,"OK, Yeah."
35592,PS2,6,1.84,6.72,4.88,1.0,Vulnerabilities when the supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
35592,PS2,6,12.36,15.44,3.08,1.0,That's quite a bit general.
35592,PS2,6,21.16,22.44,1.28,2.0,I don't need to know what that means.
35592,PS2,6,22.52,27.64,5.12,2.0,I mean I I don't get the the the the the specific problem.
35592,PS2,6,27.64,30.12,2.48,1.0,"Well, I don't think it's, it's very, it's a very."
35592,PS2,6,30.12,30.96,0.84,3.0,General question.
35592,PS2,6,31.48,32.84,1.36,1.0,It's like what vulnerability?
35592,PS2,6,34.4,36.48,2.08,2.0,"Exactly, I need an example."
35592,PS2,6,36.48,36.92,0.44,4.0,Of the.
35592,PS2,6,36.92,37.52,0.6,1.0,Vulnerability.
35592,PS2,6,37.64,39.92,2.28,2.0,"Yeah, with the."
35592,PS2,6,40.0,41.28,1.28,1.0,Cost inefficiency.
35592,PS2,6,42.56,44.24,1.68,3.0,We could just think of.
35592,PS2,6,44.24,44.6,0.36,1.0,1
35592,PS2,6,44.72,45.92,1.2,3.0,And try to tackle that.
35592,PS2,6,49.16,61.52,12.36,2.0,"Or we can talk about organization in general, because I guess that you know, if everything is organized and goes according to plan that you counter the vulnerability."
35592,PS2,6,61.52,63.84,2.32,2.0,But they I mean it would be too general.
35592,PS2,6,69.4,70.04,0.64,1.0,You could like I.
35592,PS2,6,78.91,87.36,8.45,4.0,"Think she's that would it's typical example of a supply chain, maybe an organization or a company or something like that."
35592,PS2,6,88.28,89.92,1.64,4.0,Do we have one we could relate to and?
35592,PS2,6,90.76,91.08,0.32,2.0,Then we.
35592,PS2,6,91.44,93.16,1.72,4.0,Draw influences from there.
35592,PS2,6,93.84,95.8,1.96,3.0,Like a like a basic food like.
35592,PS2,6,95.96,96.4,0.44,1.0,I don't.
35592,PS2,6,97.2,97.48,0.28,3.0,Know like.
35592,PS2,6,97.48,99.32,1.84,2.0,"Apples social market, yeah, or."
35592,PS2,6,99.56,100.56,1.0,4.0,Maybe agriculture?
35592,PS2,6,100.92,101.72,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, OK."
35592,PS2,6,102.96,103.08,0.12,2.0,OK.
35592,PS2,6,103.88,105.76,1.88,4.0,So let's consumer food now.
35592,PS2,6,106.52,109.2,2.68,4.0,What sort of vulnerabilities will come from it?
35592,PS2,6,111.88,117.12,5.24,1.0,Like reliability of like harvests and and like the weather and the climate.
35592,PS2,6,118.0,121.8,3.8,3.0,And stuff for like good growth and yield.
35592,PS2,6,122.88,137.04,14.16,2.0,"And the fact that I mean like he produced 1000, but then 800 will actually be bought by the intermediate or the supermarket or?"
35592,PS2,6,137.12,137.56,0.44,1.0,Whatever.
35592,PS2,6,138.12,143.64,5.52,2.0,So you kind of lose apples and profits along the chain.
35592,PS2,6,145.92,153.56,7.64,5.0,I was thinking like a general solution could be a centralised system because I feel like there's a bit of communication breakdown along the supply chain.
35592,PS2,6,153.84,166.36,12.52,5.0,"So maybe just a centralised communication platform that all the stakeholders in the supply chain can have access to, so they can directly communicate with the top of the chain instead of going through 1 by 1."
35592,PS2,6,167.28,168.92,1.64,1.0,Would that be like an online?
35592,PS2,6,169.12,170.0,0.88,3.0,Like what?
35592,PS2,6,170.0,171.28,1.28,3.0,What do you sort of envisage?
35592,PS2,6,171.44,173.8,2.36,5.0,I was thinking of like an online platform.
35592,PS2,6,174.36,175.0,0.64,1.0,"OK, that's cool."
35592,PS2,6,175.36,183.12,7.76,2.0,"And maybe I mean, that's mostly for the apples per SE, but I guess."
35592,PS2,6,183.4,183.8,0.4,4.0,That.
35592,PS2,6,184.56,188.24,3.68,2.0,In a lot of change you know you start with more and you end up with less.
35592,PS2,6,189.0,198.56,9.56,2.0,So maybe have a side chain to with alternative ways of.
35592,PS2,6,198.56,206.96,8.4,2.0,I don't know what I want to say.
35592,PS2,6,210.52,217.76,7.24,2.0,"OK, so for the products that will not make it to the end of the chain, find alternative uses or some kind of recycling."
35592,PS2,6,218.56,218.92,0.36,3.0,Thing.
35592,PS2,6,219.84,223.56,3.72,2.0,So that you have less loss.
35592,PS2,6,223.6,223.88,0.28,3.0,If that.
35592,PS2,6,224.36,224.92,0.56,2.0,Makes sense?
35592,PS2,6,225.6,231.04,5.44,1.0,I guess that's like that's in place like a lot of like with like leftover meat or something that goes like dog food.
35592,PS2,6,231.04,231.32,0.28,6.0,And like.
35592,PS2,6,232.16,232.96,0.8,3.0,"Yeah, it's a good yeah."
35592,PS2,6,233.0,234.4,1.4,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35592,PS2,6,234.92,241.72,6.8,2.0,"But even like with, I don't know, phone companies right now, right, You could just like take the."
35592,PS2,6,242.88,243.4,0.52,5.0,Back phones.
35592,PS2,6,243.88,246.32,2.44,2.0,And break them down into the materials to make new ones.
35592,PS2,6,246.32,257.44,11.12,2.0,"So they're they, they can either like the second chain to either like lead somewhere else, like to charity, or you could just make a loop and like reinforce the round chain."
35592,PS2,6,257.96,278.64,20.68,1.0,"I can even like tie into like your idea of like if there's like some sort of online platform or it's like a social media of companies like coordinating there's supply chains, like if there's like extra like if there's waste or something that that isn't being used, like another sort of link people up who need need a certain resource, I don't know."
35592,PS2,6,281.08,282.76,1.68,2.0,"You could, I mean we could."
35592,PS2,6,282.84,297.36,14.52,2.0,"If you want to make it like in between companies, then the alternative chain could be could lead to like a pool from multiple different companies."
35592,PS2,6,297.8,299.28,1.48,2.0,I don't know if I'm explaining that correctly.

35592,PS2,6,425.52,426.04,0.52,3.0,That could also be.
35592,PS2,6,426.04,426.84,0.8,3.0,"Well, that'll be."
35592,PS2,6,426.84,430.04,3.2,1.0,"Like a different idea though, yeah, Which one?"

35592,PS2,6,446.72,460.4,13.68,6.0,"So they this organization will buy all those products from darker organizations, from the other organizations and they will resell those products to the business or to the customer stocks."
35592,PS2,6,465.52,468.56,3.04,4.0,Like they sell to other people who needs and those people.
35592,PS2,6,468.56,469.48,0.92,2.0,Resell to others.

36204,PS4,3,50.28,50.92,0.64,2.0,You know that's true.
36204,PS4,3,53.68,62.16,8.48,2.0,"You are going for a really, really creative, friendly idea and thinking maybe we can get all the kids and have them moving."
36204,PS4,3,62.16,62.76,0.6,1.0,Together.
36204,PS4,3,64.16,66.76,2.6,2.0,Like a concentration camp.

36204,PS4,3,75.8,75.96,0.16,2.0,It'd.
36204,PS4,3,76.04,76.76,0.72,1.0,Have to be free.
36204,PS4,3,77.52,80.76,3.24,3.0,And also to rotate teachers between the boarding schools.
36204,PS4,3,81.84,93.48,11.64,2.0,"Teachers, I think if if the government needs to control the whole thing then that won't be a big issue because the existing quality issue is parents can pay students to better boarding schools."
36204,PS4,3,93.48,95.36,1.88,2.0,So that creates the equality.
36204,PS4,3,95.76,99.56,3.8,2.0,"So because parents who are the person who are paying, that makes."
36204,PS4,3,99.56,100.96,1.4,3.0,The difference We will.
36204,PS4,3,101.04,102.12,1.08,3.0,We will move teachers.

36204,PS4,3,105.2,109.24,4.04,3.0,So that each school would be kind of statistically close.
36204,PS4,3,109.28,109.4,0.12,3.0,OK.
36204,PS4,3,112.32,112.48,0.16,2.0,Let's.
36204,PS4,3,113.12,116.04,2.92,3.0,See if we still have time for other ideas.
36204,PS4,3,150.36,160.44,10.08,1.0,"Probably adding to your idea, like maybe the government actually paying teachers more, so like there's a greater incentive for like people to become teachers anyway you."
36204,PS4,3,160.44,165.28,4.84,2.0,"Know I, I think the current issue is there are private school and public school."
36204,PS4,3,165.48,168.72,3.24,2.0,So there are still schools that are run by companies.
36204,PS4,3,170.04,182.2,12.16,2.0,But maybe a build up from where we can do a teacher system that every teacher is employed by the government like the NHS and the doctor are employed by the government so they will be paid equally.
36204,PS4,3,183.16,185.24,2.08,2.0,They cannot choose which school they go to.
36204,PS4,3,185.64,186.96,1.32,2.0,Is the government ability.

36204,PS4,3,192.24,208.8,16.56,3.0,An an equal distribution sources by reimagining the school education.
36204,PS4,3,216.44,222.2,5.76,1.0,"Me about like public and private schools, they've got like different facilities like with private school you've got like so."
36204,PS4,3,223.2,227.4,4.2,2.0,Many people taking teachers won't be the solution we should.
36204,PS4,3,228.16,228.88,0.72,3.0,Rotate the students.
36204,PS4,3,229.6,229.64,0.04,3.0,Oh.

36204,PS4,3,236.24,251.08,14.84,3.0,"From now on, every school in the country will be will be a boarding school."

36204,PS4,3,293.48,316.56,23.08,3.0,"Facilities and organization, but also also both teachers and students will be rotated from one school to another."
36204,PS4,3,328.2,359.64,31.44,3.0,"Rotated from, I don't know, termly basis, week basis, year on term, semester basis so that one school would not be better was than the other."
36204,PS4,3,361.68,362.08,0.4,3.0,How do they?
36204,PS4,3,362.08,362.2,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36204,PS4,3,362.84,376.6,13.76,1.0,"For that, like the children are exposed to like the different, they have the same opportunities to like experience different facilities in different schools."
36204,PS4,3,381.64,385.48,3.84,3.0,Would have the same fortuning.
36204,PS4,3,393.16,408.22,15.06,3.0,To experience different teachers and learning environments.

36388,PS6,3,297.64,297.92,0.28,1.0,OK.
35217,PS3,6,1.44,18.0,16.56,1.0,Last one let's post AI do AS1A0A new panel Oh God it starts with everything good sorry so we can just.
35217,PS3,6,18.16,19.64,1.48,2.0,Make it like a like.
35217,PS3,6,19.8,20.48,0.68,1.0,A ban.
35217,PS3,6,20.6,21.24,0.64,1.0,Ban the words.
35217,PS3,6,30.16,31.76,1.6,3.0,Quarantine can't speak to anyone.
35217,PS3,6,33.2,33.56,0.36,4.0,Silence.
35217,PS3,6,34.24,38.52,4.28,4.0,I think women probably say sorry the most.
35217,PS3,6,39.0,51.12,12.12,4.0,"So I think I think to reduce that you have like you have like more of like an empowerment campaign about things that you shouldn't, shouldn't be sorry for and actually you shouldn't really be sorry for much."
35217,PS3,6,52.32,62.2,9.88,4.0,"And also like, like different ways to say it, like with flowers or like I apologise."
35217,PS3,6,63.92,64.12,0.2,1.0,OK.
35217,PS3,6,64.12,65.44,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, that, that I think."
35217,PS3,6,65.84,67.2,1.36,4.0,"There's not, obviously there's not."
35217,PS3,6,67.32,68.72,1.4,4.0,They're not asking for like a practical.
35217,PS3,6,68.8,69.88,1.08,5.0,"Yeah, I think I'm thinking of it."
35217,PS3,6,70.08,74.44,4.36,1.0,"From a more OK, I was thinking of it from a more biological perspective."
35217,PS3,6,76.28,76.6,0.32,4.0,Go on.
35217,PS3,6,76.6,76.64,0.04,5.0,I.
35217,PS3,6,77.12,84.12,7.0,1.0,"Was just more like If so, I don't know why they specify the word sorry, but like let's assume I'm wearing a mask and so are you."
35217,PS3,6,84.6,86.44,1.84,1.0,"If I say sorry, does he still?"
35217,PS3,6,86.44,86.84,0.4,5.0,Get the.
35217,PS3,6,87.68,89.24,1.56,1.0,"Yeah, like with no contact."
35217,PS3,6,89.96,92.32,2.36,4.0,"Oh, you just think like mask wearing."
35217,PS3,6,92.32,92.64,0.32,4.0,Yeah.
35217,PS3,6,92.96,102.92,9.96,1.0,"Let's assume he can hear me but like we're in like 2 huge like we're in two rooms with like thick walls and there's like a glass window and I say sorry, does he fall asleep?"
35217,PS3,6,103.4,103.68,0.28,4.0,No.
35217,PS3,6,104.68,109.92,5.24,5.0,"I guess you just like invent, invent something that like what is sorry and have everyone wear it and what is."
35217,PS3,6,110.08,112.48,2.4,1.0,What is the process of somebody falling sick like?
35217,PS3,6,112.48,113.56,1.08,1.0,I want to understand how is it?
35217,PS3,6,114.28,115.28,1.0,5.0,No like how we are.
35217,PS3,6,115.48,117.92,2.44,1.0,Assuming it is translated and then block that out.
35217,PS3,6,119.2,122.08,2.88,1.0,Like if it's just him seeing me like say the word sorry.
35217,PS3,6,122.16,125.16,3.0,1.0,If it's hearing then we can deal with some audio problems.
35217,PS3,6,125.56,129.48,3.92,1.0,If it's just him seeing me lip sync the word sorry then then we have a visual.
35217,PS3,6,132.88,135.4,2.52,3.0,Also if it says this transmits it by saying the word.
35217,PS3,6,135.4,140.08,4.68,3.0,So if someone who's not got the disease says sorry.
35217,PS3,6,140.56,141.64,1.08,1.0,"Doesn't matter, OK."
35217,PS3,6,142.92,145.76,2.84,1.0,"Like you can't, Yeah, I think you can't generate the disease person."
35217,PS3,6,145.76,154.24,8.48,1.0,"So that's what like, but that's what like how if I have it, under what circumstances will you get it?"
35217,PS3,6,154.24,160.04,5.8,1.0,"If I say sorry, Like if I'm in the other, like when Scotland, when I say sorry, do you get it?"
35217,PS3,6,162.52,163.8,1.28,4.0,I think we can just make our own.
35217,PS3,6,163.96,165.28,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, so like, let's make."
35217,PS3,6,165.28,170.12,4.84,4.0,"An assumption it's transmitted by it's transmitted in the same way that like, coughing is."
35217,PS3,6,170.36,173.92,3.56,4.0,So like saying sorry means you're like expelling whatever disease.
35217,PS3,6,174.64,180.8,6.16,1.0,"OK, yes, that's if you so it's not so like facing the other way and you say sorry."
35217,PS3,6,181.32,181.64,0.32,6.0,You're still.
35217,PS3,6,182.08,184.96,2.88,1.0,Gonna just because I heard it I I get the disease I'm just.
35217,PS3,6,185.4,189.36,3.96,4.0,"You might still catch it from the syndrome, but like just you don't catch it from hearing yet."
35217,PS3,6,190.88,193.56,2.68,3.0,If you're here and you're physically in the same space.
35217,PS3,6,193.76,198.52,4.76,1.0,"OK, so basically if you're talking, the disease doesn't come out the moment you say the word sorry like it's in the air."
35217,PS3,6,198.92,199.32,0.4,4.0,"OK, Yeah."
35217,PS3,6,199.52,200.28,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, I'm just making that."
35217,PS3,6,201.0,201.24,0.24,1.0,OK.
35217,PS3,6,201.24,202.24,1.0,1.0,So now how do we deal?
35217,PS3,6,214.34,216.3,1.96,5.0,"With it, to be clear, it's by hearing or it's by."
35217,PS3,6,219.54,220.38,0.84,4.0,It's not by hearing.
35217,PS3,6,220.7,220.82,0.12,1.0,It's.
35217,PS3,6,221.1,222.86,1.76,4.0,"Yeah, it's by saying like by speaker."
35217,PS3,6,222.86,223.42,0.56,4.0,"Yeah, speaking."
35217,PS3,6,224.3,225.94,1.64,1.0,If I'm deaf and she says the word sorry.
35217,PS3,6,226.46,226.78,0.32,5.0,"OK, OK."
35217,PS3,6,226.78,226.98,0.2,5.0,OK.
35217,PS3,6,226.98,227.34,0.36,5.0,I'll get that.
35217,PS3,6,227.66,228.06,0.4,4.0,"Yeah, OK."
35217,PS3,6,233.68,236.44,2.76,5.0,"OK, then it's about preventing the person from saying so."
35217,PS3,6,236.52,236.8,0.28,5.0,Yeah.
35217,PS3,6,237.04,238.08,1.04,1.0,"Yeah, then that's."
35217,PS3,6,238.08,240.52,2.44,5.0,Then we I I guess your first idea.
35217,PS3,6,240.88,244.48,3.6,2.0,"Yeah, the yeah, the comparing it's created for sure."
35217,PS3,6,245.32,249.16,3.84,1.0,"It's a pandemic, so yeah, yeah, OK."
35217,PS3,6,251.4,261.56,10.16,1.0,"But you have to really bring a culture shift because like COVID, for example, was probably transmitted by saying anything like you can talk and like sneeze, whatever."
35217,PS3,6,262.24,269.72,7.48,1.0,"But the idea was just to wear a mask and, and it was not like a cultural, it was a temporary thing that happened."
35217,PS3,6,269.8,271.4,1.6,1.0,And then we can just we.
35217,PS3,6,271.52,274.08,2.56,2.0,Can just discourage people from saying stories.
35217,PS3,6,274.32,275.68,1.36,6.0,"Yeah, or like replace."
35217,PS3,6,276.44,279.0,2.56,2.0,The words you don't say story anymore.
35217,PS3,6,279.72,280.6,0.88,1.0,Use synonyms.
35217,PS3,6,281.0,281.6,0.6,1.0,"Yeah, like yeah."
35217,PS3,6,282.76,284.84,2.08,1.0,Or do like perform gestures?
35217,PS3,6,287.6,294.88,7.28,6.0,"But that could be accompanied by something cultural, like COVID taught us to be more hygienic just in like, in every single way."
35217,PS3,6,295.72,303.64,7.92,6.0,"So the sorry pandemic could come with something around like, like people in Britain say sorry too much."
35217,PS3,6,304.56,304.96,0.4,4.0,You know.
35217,PS3,6,305.4,306.44,1.04,6.0,To to stop.
35217,PS3,6,306.96,310.0,3.04,4.0,"Yeah, like Canadians sort themselves out."
35217,PS3,6,310.16,310.4,0.24,4.0,Yeah.
35217,PS3,6,310.88,311.2,0.32,4.0,OK.
35217,PS3,6,311.2,315.12,3.92,4.0,So I'm going to say we would.
35217,PS3,6,319.08,324.68,5.6,1.0,This question I have some.
35217,PS3,6,328.48,328.68,0.2,6.0,For.
35217,PS3,6,341.96,342.56,0.6,3.0,US.
35217,PS3,6,348.52,352.48,3.96,1.0,Much talented.
35217,PS3,6,355.08,355.68,0.6,4.0,And.
35217,PS3,6,356.68,358.84,2.16,3.0,Possible gestures?
35217,PS3,6,388.2,390.2,2.0,1.0,The question is it easier for it to answer?
35217,PS3,6,393.84,406.6,12.76,1.0,I don't know is it easier for the AI to answer because it gives this one data to generate the questions?
35217,PS3,6,447.32,450.96,3.64,3.0,What if you hear like an audio recording saying sorry?
35217,PS3,6,453.2,457.6,4.4,1.0,I think the person has to be there other than any like so many songs if you just listen to them.
35217,PS3,6,458.96,459.12,0.16,1.0,Sorry.
35217,PS3,6,459.28,464.04,4.76,1.0,By testing me to be falling sick.
35217,PS3,6,466.2,467.64,1.44,3.0,Are you thinking psychologically?
35217,PS3,6,467.64,472.2,4.56,3.0,You condition people to hearing sorry and then you give them like an electric shock?
35217,PS3,6,472.64,474.96,2.32,3.0,It's just conditioned to not to say sorry.
35217,PS3,6,476.04,477.0,0.96,3.0,Is that afraid of this?
35217,PS3,6,477.64,478.0,0.36,1.0,That's.
35217,PS3,6,478.2,482.4,4.2,2.0,Borderline human.
35217,PS3,6,485.24,485.96,0.72,3.0,It's unethical.
35217,PS3,6,487.92,488.28,0.36,4.0,Well.
35217,PS3,6,516.05,516.57,0.52,5.0,Should we just?
35217,PS3,6,517.05,517.89,0.84,4.0,Submit just a minute.
35651,PS2,6,50.16,51.48,1.32,1.0,Stronger encryption or for data kind.
35651,PS2,6,58.16,60.48,2.32,2.0,Of this question is is professional.
35651,PS2,6,61.6,61.92,0.32,1.0,No the.
35651,PS2,6,61.96,62.6,0.64,3.0,Robot is too.
35651,PS2,6,62.6,63.16,0.56,1.0,Broad.
35651,PS2,6,63.24,64.64,1.4,3.0,"I think, but it's broad."
35651,PS2,6,65.0,65.56,0.56,4.0,"Yeah, there."
35651,PS2,6,65.64,65.92,0.28,5.0,Are many.
35651,PS2,6,65.92,66.28,0.36,3.0,Different.
35651,PS2,6,67.84,71.44,3.6,2.0,Don't don't know very much about the supply chain so.
35651,PS2,6,72.32,75.28,2.96,4.0,It's just everything from production to.
35651,PS2,6,75.8,75.92,0.12,6.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,76.72,77.84,1.12,2.0,And security.
35651,PS2,6,77.84,81.44,3.6,2.0,So we need to define the vulnerability and security I think.
35651,PS2,6,82.08,82.76,0.68,4.0,"Yeah, there is just."
35651,PS2,6,83.2,85.0,1.8,6.0,Actually is it like the technical security?
35651,PS2,6,85.2,87.68,2.48,6.0,Because I saw it from information perspective.
35651,PS2,6,87.68,88.16,0.48,5.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35651,PS2,6,88.36,90.76,2.4,5.0,I worked at some projects already.
35651,PS2,6,90.92,92.04,1.12,5.0,That is security.
35651,PS2,6,92.28,93.6,1.32,2.0,So give you a professional.
35651,PS2,6,95.32,95.8,0.48,5.0,That they are.
35651,PS2,6,95.8,99.12,3.32,5.0,They are in the in coding level coding level.
35651,PS2,6,99.52,108.4,8.88,6.0,"Because if it's like more of information security, then this will be like applying stronger encryption algorithms, applying."
35651,PS2,6,108.52,110.4,1.88,5.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
35651,PS2,6,110.4,111.08,0.68,5.0,This is my choice.
35651,PS2,6,111.08,111.2,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,111.28,111.4,0.12,5.0,But.
35651,PS2,6,112.12,113.44,1.32,1.0,Probably it's a more broadly.
35651,PS2,6,113.44,115.16,1.72,5.0,But is it creating?
35651,PS2,6,115.16,115.28,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,117.6,118.64,1.04,3.0,Maybe first?
35651,PS2,6,119.04,119.52,0.48,1.0,Thinking about.
35651,PS2,6,119.52,119.76,0.24,3.0,The way.
35651,PS2,6,119.76,124.36,4.6,1.0,To identify this vulnerabilities and then.
35651,PS2,6,125.04,128.0,2.96,5.0,And we can we can use machine learning.
35651,PS2,6,128.16,137.56,9.4,5.0,"I think it'll change to two-part predicted there and then we can I think some, Yeah, that's a good."
35651,PS2,6,138.68,138.88,0.2,1.0,Point.
35651,PS2,6,139.64,139.96,0.32,5.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,140.72,141.04,0.32,1.0,To use.
35651,PS2,6,141.04,141.96,0.92,2.0,"Technology, right?"
35651,PS2,6,142.0,144.16,2.16,2.0,So we can have a lot of technology.
35651,PS2,6,148.96,150.88,1.92,6.0,Because the normal solution would be.
35651,PS2,6,151.36,152.6,1.24,4.0,Applying technologies.
35651,PS2,6,152.92,161.24,8.32,6.0,"Like sensors, AI, machine learning about the supply chain, get get rich information, analyze it, they take actions."
35651,PS2,6,161.72,167.68,5.96,6.0,So this is the normal one I so we need to have something else that will be creative.
35651,PS2,6,173.04,174.96,1.92,3.0,So what?
35651,PS2,6,174.96,176.52,1.56,3.0,What would be a creative way to?
35651,PS2,6,176.72,179.56,2.84,1.0,Identify any kind of vulnerabilities.
35651,PS2,6,184.08,184.24,0.16,6.0,Thank.
35651,PS2,6,184.6,189.2,4.6,1.0,You because you you have to 1st identify and then.
35651,PS2,6,189.48,190.48,1.0,3.0,Decided how?
35651,PS2,6,190.68,190.84,0.16,1.0,Are you?
35651,PS2,6,190.84,201.24,10.4,2.0,"Going to yeah, yeah, I think it's not well defined and yeah, you will say that on country courts and it's inefficient delivery schedules."
35651,PS2,6,201.24,201.68,0.44,2.0,So yeah.
35651,PS2,6,201.84,202.04,0.2,1.0,They they.
35651,PS2,6,202.44,206.96,4.52,5.0,"They can start the the the required things in the last, maybe a."
35651,PS2,6,208.04,208.44,0.4,3.0,Three months.
35651,PS2,6,208.84,209.16,0.32,5.0,Ago.
35651,PS2,6,228.26,229.66,1.4,2.0,"So the chance about people, right?"
35651,PS2,6,229.78,235.18,5.4,2.0,"So, so the people move on the staff."
35651,PS2,6,237.3,237.74,0.44,2.0,So.
35651,PS2,6,238.26,238.42,0.16,3.0,Maybe.
35651,PS2,6,239.42,239.58,0.16,3.0,Maybe.
35651,PS2,6,240.46,242.18,1.72,2.0,"The focus on the people, maybe."
35651,PS2,6,243.08,244.84,1.76,4.0,It's more kind of logistics.
35651,PS2,6,245.84,246.36,0.52,6.0,"Yeah, supply."
35651,PS2,6,246.36,247.88,1.52,4.0,"Chain is really broad mode, yeah."
35651,PS2,6,248.36,248.48,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,249.16,249.28,0.12,5.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,250.84,251.08,0.24,6.0,"Yeah, it's."
35651,PS2,6,251.16,253.2,2.04,4.0,Very kind of global thing nowadays.
35651,PS2,6,253.92,254.16,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,254.2,263.8,9.6,2.0,"I mean, if you have a very strong communication device such as, yeah, so maybe people will."
35651,PS2,6,264.72,272.8,8.08,5.0,So why not we ask so many things to prepare for that vulnerabilities.
35651,PS2,6,273.6,281.92,8.32,2.0,"Or, or we use robots or something like that instead of human and we have the system, but but it's more, more more vulnerable."
35651,PS2,6,281.92,283.2,1.28,2.0,"It's more vulnerable, right?"
35651,PS2,6,283.2,284.92,1.72,2.0,So maybe we should reduce this?
35651,PS2,6,285.88,287.72,1.84,3.0,Just a good way to reduce this.
35651,PS2,6,288.32,288.84,0.52,5.0,Vulnerability.
35651,PS2,6,294.88,295.24,0.36,1.0,"Maybe, yeah."
35651,PS2,6,297.52,299.56,2.04,6.0,Do we need like to decentralize it?
35651,PS2,6,300.28,300.8,0.52,4.0,Oh yeah.
35651,PS2,6,301.32,303.12,1.8,2.0,Decentralized in July or something?
35651,PS2,6,304.12,304.84,0.72,6.0,Reliance.
35651,PS2,6,304.84,305.04,0.2,4.0,On.
35651,PS2,6,305.08,306.04,0.96,5.0,"Global, yeah."
35651,PS2,6,306.68,307.16,0.48,4.0,Large.
35651,PS2,6,307.4,308.12,0.72,2.0,Networks.
35651,PS2,6,308.64,311.08,2.44,4.0,We go local instead of global but.
35651,PS2,6,313.04,313.12,0.08,5.0,It.
35651,PS2,6,314.6,314.76,0.16,3.0,Would.
35651,PS2,6,314.76,316.04,1.28,1.0,Be like advice to.
35651,PS2,6,316.52,316.96,0.44,4.0,I don't know.
35651,PS2,6,317.0,318.4,1.4,4.0,"I'm, I'm not a business person."
35651,PS2,6,318.44,326.04,7.6,4.0,I would want to you know remove kind of too much reliance on global supply chain.
35651,PS2,6,326.56,331.68,5.12,4.0,"If something if you have any phase, the the size of failure is so big."
35651,PS2,6,332.24,335.32,3.08,4.0,"So if we can search something locally, we can."
35651,PS2,6,335.8,335.96,0.16,2.0,That's.
35651,PS2,6,336.4,336.84,0.44,5.0,Something.
35651,PS2,6,338.04,340.68,2.64,4.0,That's kind of the opposite to the robot solution.
35651,PS2,6,342.56,343.68,1.12,2.0,And also it means that.
35651,PS2,6,343.84,345.84,2.0,6.0,"One efficient, yeah, Or it's."
35651,PS2,6,345.88,346.76,0.88,4.0,One big global.
35651,PS2,6,347.28,349.04,1.76,2.0,"Yeah, supply chain is very long."
35651,PS2,6,349.44,353.4,3.96,2.0,"And if it is very long, it will have more mistakes."
35651,PS2,6,353.76,359.88,6.12,2.0,"So if you're making sure to like a local 1, so it will reduce the risk of making mistakes."
35651,PS2,6,359.88,360.64,0.76,2.0,So yeah.
35651,PS2,6,361.92,362.24,0.32,3.0,So maybe.
35651,PS2,6,362.52,364.04,1.52,2.0,That's from the point of management.
35651,PS2,6,364.32,388.8,24.48,1.0,"Maybe a local, a local device that can identify the with their ability and also predict how impacting how this thing like you have a local software that we will identify, we will identify the problem and then you predict how the impact in in the supply chain maybe."
35651,PS2,6,388.8,389.92,1.12,3.0,"You know, based on."
35651,PS2,6,389.96,391.48,1.52,1.0,Machine learning or something like that.
35651,PS2,6,392.0,409.32,17.32,1.0,"And then you can like the person that is in charge of the supply chain, the central person can receive reports on the cell phone explaining the situation and then the person can act or something like that."
35651,PS2,6,410.92,411.88,0.96,1.0,But would it be that?
35651,PS2,6,413.6,415.68,2.08,4.0,Can you construct a sentence?
35651,PS2,6,423.16,423.92,0.76,3.0,Just break start.
35651,PS2,6,425.8,431.0,5.2,6.0,"Because I felt like most of the research is already in this direction, like to having more data."
35651,PS2,6,431.68,432.12,0.44,1.0,And.
35651,PS2,6,433.2,438.36,5.16,6.0,"More analytics, machine learning even with notifications for the people to take the action."
35651,PS2,6,439.2,440.2,1.0,6.0,So this is the normal 1.
35651,PS2,6,440.24,442.4,2.16,6.0,So we need like to go.
35651,PS2,6,442.4,444.04,1.64,3.0,Against the It's definitely not third grade.
35651,PS2,6,444.36,444.48,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35651,PS2,6,444.52,454.0,9.48,3.0,"I mean, we don't know how."
35651,PS2,6,454.44,455.36,0.92,1.0,Not to to.
35651,PS2,6,455.76,457.04,1.28,3.0,How this works exactly?
35651,PS2,6,457.04,459.2,2.16,3.0,"You know, at first I'm living in you."
35651,PS2,6,459.2,459.28,0.08,1.0,Know.
35651,PS2,6,460.48,462.88,2.4,3.0,"I'm saying that this is the way that it works, but."
35651,PS2,6,463.28,463.8,0.52,1.0,"Actually, we."
35651,PS2,6,464.36,470.44,6.08,3.0,"We are being created here because we don't know exactly how it works, so it could be right."
35651,PS2,6,470.76,471.4,0.64,1.0,You're running.
35651,PS2,6,472.0,477.64,5.64,3.0,Out of time how?
35651,PS2,6,477.64,477.8,0.16,1.0,Are we?
35651,PS2,6,477.8,478.56,0.76,3.0,Going to put this.
35651,PS2,6,508.2,517.32,9.12,4.0,"We we need to fit AII, see what's creative, I think."
35651,PS2,6,517.6,518.2,0.6,4.0,"Yeah, that's."
35651,PS2,6,518.36,528.16,9.8,5.0,Like actually this problem is very similar to one communication problem in the communication network and from A to B.
35651,PS2,6,528.16,535.52,7.36,5.0,And if the line and doesn't work and then we can it's some digital twin to predict this thing.
35651,PS2,6,535.52,540.36,4.84,5.0,And then we we can send another backup line to to do the communication.
35651,PS2,6,541.36,542.0,0.64,6.0,The user twin.
35651,PS2,6,546.48,546.88,0.4,3.0,What do?
35651,PS2,6,546.96,547.44,0.48,6.0,You think?
35651,PS2,6,552.28,554.24,1.96,4.0,It's basically predicting analytics.
35651,PS2,6,562.04,562.64,0.6,6.0,What did you say?
35651,PS2,6,563.28,564.0,0.72,4.0,Predict.
35651,PS2,6,564.36,567.36,3.0,4.0,"I mean, why you have described is just predictive analogies."
35651,PS2,6,570.92,573.4,2.48,6.0,Because this is actually descriptive I believe.
35651,PS2,6,573.64,574.2,0.56,6.0,Am I correct?
35651,PS2,6,574.2,577.72,3.52,6.0,"This is not predictive, so I need to mention and."
35651,PS2,6,589.84,590.92,1.08,6.0,Predictive analysis.
35651,PS2,6,591.0,592.76,1.76,6.0,We can mention the other twins here.
35651,PS2,6,593.36,595.92,2.56,5.0,"What, what, what what space between the Spanish?"
35651,PS2,6,596.0,596.12,0.12,5.0,OK.
35651,PS2,6,602.24,603.68,1.44,6.0,Feel free to.
35651,PS2,6,608.64,608.72,0.08,5.0,Add.
35651,PS2,6,614.88,615.8,0.92,6.0,Digital Twin.
35651,PS2,6,629.04,629.48,0.44,5.0,We can.
35651,PS2,6,635.88,640.6,4.72,2.0,We can next right or.
35501,PS4,3,0.88,6.52,5.64,1.0,Educational inequalities that unequal distribution to academic resources to disadvantage marginalized groups.
35501,PS4,3,6.76,10.56,3.8,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to overcome inequality in education.
35501,PS4,3,11.28,12.44,1.16,2.0,"OK, one creative idea."
35501,PS4,3,13.92,15.44,1.52,3.0,Overcome inequality.
35501,PS4,3,18.56,20.44,1.88,2.0,In education.
35501,PS4,3,23.96,32.88,8.92,1.0,"OK, so one of the things about any is that parents they need to put their their kids in with a tutor and they need to pay extra, right?"
35501,PS4,3,32.88,34.12,1.24,1.0,"In this country, that's how it works."
35501,PS4,3,34.12,40.92,6.8,1.0,Like to go and do the grammar school you need to have had exposure to a tutor and I guess it.
35501,PS4,3,41.52,41.72,0.2,2.0,Helps.
35501,PS4,3,42.64,43.12,0.48,1.0,And I guess.
35501,PS4,3,43.72,44.64,0.92,2.0,I'm having a tutor.
35501,PS4,3,45.32,45.44,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,45.44,45.8,0.36,2.0,But in the.
35501,PS4,3,45.96,47.12,1.16,1.0,US is completely different.
35501,PS4,3,47.92,50.32,2.4,1.0,In the US you have divided classes.
35501,PS4,3,50.32,52.12,1.8,1.0,"We were speaking about this, yeah."
35501,PS4,3,52.92,60.16,7.24,1.0,And you can test into more advanced classes and it's just based on the knowledge that you acquire within the school and your homework.
35501,PS4,3,60.2,71.4,11.2,1.0,"Like you're never force, you're never exposed to a test where you would have had to been studying additional material with a tutor, unlike here."
35501,PS4,3,72.04,72.56,0.52,2.0,That makes sense.
35501,PS4,3,72.64,77.88,5.24,2.0,"So I mean, the difference between people from from means to people who don't have means is the resources."
35501,PS4,3,78.0,79.0,1.0,2.0,"And well, there's two things."
35501,PS4,3,79.0,83.0,4.0,2.0,"Parents who are at a certain level are better able to support their kids, right?"
35501,PS4,3,83.0,85.4,2.4,2.0,"To help their homework course, they encourage them, all right."
35501,PS4,3,85.88,92.8,6.92,2.0,"And they have the means to help their kids, but to help their tutor, as you said, to more expensive public feedback, school, higher tutor, whatever."
35501,PS4,3,93.12,96.56,3.44,1.0,"So to reduce inequality, you gotta combat those two elements."
35501,PS4,3,96.56,96.76,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,97.08,103.36,6.28,1.0,"So I think it has to happen within the school walls where that's, that's what's democratized, you know, that's where the access happens."
35501,PS4,3,103.76,104.12,0.36,2.0,"Well, that's."
35501,PS4,3,104.12,105.12,1.0,1.0,Where we can control to.
35501,PS4,3,105.2,108.88,3.68,2.0,"Be fair to an extent, because the fact that they're already in a different school already is undemocratic, right?"
35501,PS4,3,108.96,114.16,5.2,2.0,"You're gonna have the sort of life they already go to prep school, just getting into a good public school and so on and so on."
35501,PS4,3,115.28,122.12,6.84,1.0,So you need to support kids from privileged backgrounds to give them the very best support.
35501,PS4,3,122.12,129.64,7.52,2.0,"And I need more support because I don't have the parents who support them intellectually potentially, and they're never going to have the funds to go into those schools, right?"
35501,PS4,3,129.64,136.04,6.4,1.0,So how do you support kids from a very young age to give them a massive boost in terms of their learning experience?
35501,PS4,3,138.12,147.36,9.24,1.0,"I think, I think it comes down to identifying kids from under primitive backgrounds and throwing a ton of resources at them to actually getting that tutor to get an additional after school care."
35501,PS4,3,147.36,149.32,1.96,2.0,"For example, both the parents are working."
35501,PS4,3,149.68,151.12,1.44,2.0,"There's going to be multiple jobs, right?"
35501,PS4,3,151.12,153.84,2.72,2.0,"So they might not be around, right?"
35501,PS4,3,153.84,168.56,14.72,1.0,"So investing in tutoring and additional hours of schooling for those from weaker backgrounds would offset people having private help for their kids, and we'd also make sure that they get the intellectual support they need to excel at school."
35501,PS4,3,168.76,169.64,0.88,1.0,So basically.
35501,PS4,3,169.84,180.12,10.28,3.0,"I mean, it's are you talking about certain certain poor people or, or like as in like we should go to the lower desk house schools and like put some money in we'd."
35501,PS4,3,180.12,184.28,4.16,2.0,Identify people who are because I think it's just you can work out where people are going to struggle.
35501,PS4,3,184.6,188.68,4.08,2.0,"You probably tell which area of the country, which schools, people are not going to go to Oxford."
35501,PS4,3,188.72,196.4,7.68,3.0,"In New Zealand we have a decile system, so the lower decile is like socio economically lower and there's probably something here like that."
35501,PS4,3,196.4,196.44,0.04,3.0,I.
35501,PS4,3,196.72,198.92,2.2,2.0,Mean you know where people are not going to get involved.
35501,PS4,3,198.92,199.68,0.76,2.0,Basically very simple.
35501,PS4,3,199.68,201.44,1.76,2.0,Oxford acceptance rates right?
35501,PS4,3,201.56,208.04,6.48,2.0,The parts of the country schools with the lowest Oxford acceptance rates need to get help or red brick university acceptance rates right.
35501,PS4,3,208.28,208.68,0.4,1.0,"OK, so we're."
35501,PS4,3,208.68,211.84,3.16,3.0,Saying let's ignore like the rich private schools.
35501,PS4,3,212.12,214.12,2.0,3.0,"So now like, you know, that's not they're fine, they're OK."
35501,PS4,3,214.52,216.84,2.32,3.0,So we're gonna identify the low income.
35501,PS4,3,217.36,217.8,0.44,1.0,"Schools, yeah."
35501,PS4,3,218.4,220.04,1.64,2.0,Lower socioeconomic classes.
35501,PS4,3,220.36,220.76,0.4,3.0,Yes.
35501,PS4,3,221.0,226.16,5.16,1.0,"And so if we bring a bunch of resources into that setting, I mean, what is the thing that's going to trigger the interest?"
35501,PS4,3,226.16,229.52,3.36,1.0,Because I think it's asking a lot to have kids stay after.
35501,PS4,3,229.52,233.84,4.32,1.0,Like what's their motivation when all their when they don't have the culture of learning around.
35501,PS4,3,233.84,234.2,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, well do."
35501,PS4,3,234.28,239.44,5.16,2.0,"You know what, they're gonna actually stay longer and has another flip side as well as you're gonna actually have far less trouble with these kids."
35501,PS4,3,239.56,240.88,1.32,2.0,They're off the streets for extra.
35501,PS4,3,241.12,244.88,3.76,2.0,"This is a very helpful to do to make sure, because they need to do that homework."
35501,PS4,3,244.88,246.88,2.0,2.0,They need to be supervised for more hours of a day.
35501,PS4,3,246.88,248.44,1.56,2.0,"Yeah, in a much more rigid system."
35501,PS4,3,248.44,249.56,1.12,1.0,Then how do you get them to want?
35501,PS4,3,249.96,250.48,0.52,2.0,To do that better.
35501,PS4,3,250.96,251.36,0.4,3.0,Teachers.
35501,PS4,3,251.56,252.36,0.8,3.0,"I mean, it's more."
35501,PS4,3,252.8,253.0,0.2,1.0,"Well, you."
35501,PS4,3,253.28,256.0,2.72,2.0,"Can even you know, there was a time I was supposed by mandatory, right?"
35501,PS4,3,256.0,258.36,2.36,2.0,"Not nowadays, but there was a time that wouldn't have been a choice."
35501,PS4,3,258.8,265.12,6.32,2.0,"I guess what you want to do is engage the parents to say, look, you're having up here, we say it nicely, you're having a hard life, not things like this."
35501,PS4,3,265.92,276.08,10.16,2.0,"You know, we are, we are, we are proposing stepping in with all the resources in the world to make sure that your child has a chance of doing very, very well what everyone would go for it."
35501,PS4,3,277.48,294.12,16.64,3.0,"Also programs like feeding like lunches in in in class and breakfast, providing breakfast in schools that actually massively helps because often a lot of these lower economic students they're not they haven't eaten concentrate."
35501,PS4,3,294.16,294.6,0.44,1.0,Exactly.
35501,PS4,3,294.8,295.24,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, like."
35501,PS4,3,295.6,298.72,3.12,3.0,"Those like, there's like other, you know, like initiatives."
35501,PS4,3,299.16,300.32,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, OK."
35501,PS4,3,300.4,306.96,6.56,3.0,I can help them.
35501,PS4,3,309.16,309.88,0.72,3.0,I agree.
35501,PS4,3,309.92,311.8,1.88,3.0,"I think parents, yeah."
35501,PS4,3,311.8,314.64,2.84,3.0,"Like, they need to be brought into this."
35501,PS4,3,314.68,314.96,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,315.4,323.2,7.8,3.0,Because often also like thinking about like the teenagers they might not want to go to after school activities because they've got to go to work.
35501,PS4,3,323.48,323.88,0.4,2.0,You start.
35501,PS4,3,323.88,327.6,3.72,2.0,"You start down, you start early, you start at the very start of dedication."
35501,PS4,3,327.88,336.24,8.36,2.0,"But I think I would have thought about, you know, naive, surely at least a large chunk of parents would want the best for their kids and would, would sign up for a program like this."
35501,PS4,3,336.6,344.08,7.48,2.0,"When you say, look, you know, based on the school that your child goes to, they're going to struggle to get into a good school afterwards."
35501,PS4,3,344.4,350.76,6.36,2.0,"So we run a program whereby we actually provide additional support, which also means that you don't have to worry about after school care because you're working."
35501,PS4,3,350.96,353.24,2.28,2.0,"We'll keep your child in school until six, 7:00 PM."
35501,PS4,3,353.24,355.4,2.16,2.0,"We'll feed your child, as you said, right?"
35501,PS4,3,356.0,367.92,11.92,2.0,"So we'll take care of it and by doing so, we'll provide the structure for them to actually do their homework properly, have additional support through tutor, and we can make sure that they stay on the straight and narrow rather than presumably hanging out on the streets as we said."
35501,PS4,3,367.92,373.28,5.36,2.0,"And and not, not taking those things from a young age, right, from age 5 to 6 or whatever it is."
35501,PS4,3,373.36,373.52,0.16,2.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,374.8,378.12,3.32,1.0,"So then there there's a, yeah, free childcare compliance, Yeah."
35501,PS4,3,378.84,387.68,8.84,2.0,"I think it's kind of like a contract with the parent and the child initially with a parent later a child as well saying we'll we'll give you the support you would not have access to otherwise, but you need to actually stay in the program."
35501,PS4,3,387.68,388.64,0.96,2.0,You need to do this properly.
35501,PS4,3,388.64,395.84,7.2,2.0,"I don't know if it worked, but I mean, those are the differences between people who have means and people who don't have means."
35501,PS4,3,397.28,397.88,0.6,3.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,397.88,403.88,6.0,3.0,And I think also a big one is barriers to like you can't be what you can't see.
35501,PS4,3,403.96,414.44,10.48,3.0,"So if like someone from a lower desktop background has never had like ACEO speak to them from like that school, they will think that all all they can do is what they see around them, right."
35501,PS4,3,414.44,415.72,1.28,3.0,Like they'll stay in that town.
35501,PS4,3,416.12,417.88,1.76,3.0,So like like role models?
35501,PS4,3,418.4,419.84,1.44,2.0,Like a body system sort of thing.
35501,PS4,3,419.84,420.28,0.44,2.0,Exactly.
35501,PS4,3,420.96,431.32,10.36,1.0,"But I was thinking like also, is there any kind of rotational system or I don't know what it would give you necessarily to go have access to one of those schools and see, you know, the type of education?"
35501,PS4,3,431.32,432.12,0.8,1.0,Like is there some kind of?
35501,PS4,3,433.88,434.28,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,434.52,436.76,2.24,2.0,Does the US have vouchers for for for schools?
35501,PS4,3,437.52,445.96,8.44,2.0,"The US Republican to a talking point where they say, well, they're actually paying for public school as in state schools they issue vouchers for for kids to attend private school."
35501,PS4,3,446.64,449.48,2.84,2.0,"This one's what TV wants, but I don't know much about the US education system."
35501,PS4,3,450.36,450.96,0.6,2.0,You could buy there's.
35501,PS4,3,450.96,452.64,1.68,1.0,Probably some scholarship spots.
35501,PS4,3,452.84,460.68,7.84,2.0,"Yeah, so you could buy, I think grammar schools were one of the things that they tried to do in many years going now obviously they've been brought back again or they're renewed whenever."
35501,PS4,3,461.16,468.88,7.72,2.0,"But also you could say why not actually start buying places for really promising kids at at Eton, you know, right, Because they're very good schools."
35501,PS4,3,468.92,471.28,2.36,2.0,"You don't get into them because they cost £50,000 a term, but."
35501,PS4,3,472.44,472.76,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,472.76,482.88,10.12,3.0,"And like, so my, my, my mom, like my parents came from a poor background and my mom like, got a scholarship, like to go to private school, like at a young age, and she would not be able to afford it."
35501,PS4,3,484.0,490.32,6.32,3.0,"So yeah, like scholarships and actually like getting access to that quality of education is good, but it's not scalable."
35501,PS4,3,490.48,491.08,0.6,1.0,"Right, because."
35501,PS4,3,491.2,493.4,2.2,3.0,There's only like a handful of people who can do that.
35501,PS4,3,493.72,499.8,6.08,1.0,"You're still leaving behind the majority, you know, you're still focusing, you're still concentrating resources within the elites."
35501,PS4,3,499.96,500.6,0.64,3.0,Exactly.
35501,PS4,3,500.6,504.0,3.4,3.0,"Whereas we're trying to improve, still lagging, you know, like the state."
35501,PS4,3,504.4,510.52,6.12,1.0,"I think, yeah, the challenge with the system here is that you you have to go out and do more in order to get ahead."
35501,PS4,3,511.0,514.64,3.64,1.0,And it's like you not everybody has equal access just by attending the.
35501,PS4,3,515.52,517.16,1.64,2.0,"Someone, this is the normal school system."
35501,PS4,3,517.16,517.6,0.44,2.0,This is true.
35501,PS4,3,517.6,521.12,3.52,2.0,Someone sent to me is when the other day actually it's came up constantly at a day or something.
35501,PS4,3,521.8,523.92,2.12,2.0,Why you don't want to send your kids to a certain school?
35501,PS4,3,524.24,527.04,2.8,2.0,Because in a lot of places it's not cool to be smart.
35501,PS4,3,527.12,528.64,1.52,2.0,It's not cool to be trying at school.
35501,PS4,3,529.16,531.6,2.44,2.0,So that environment is super self-destructive in a way.
35501,PS4,3,532.24,533.64,1.4,1.0,"OK, so we have to write this down now."
35501,PS4,3,535.52,542.12,6.6,1.0,So we're going to provide resources to schools.
35501,PS4,3,542.52,543.44,0.92,3.0,It didn't tell us you needed.
35501,PS4,3,543.56,544.04,0.48,1.0,To ours.
35501,PS4,3,544.36,546.4,2.04,3.0,"Basically more funding in schools, state schools."
35501,PS4,3,546.68,548.64,1.96,2.0,"$25 billion, about a year extra."
35501,PS4,3,548.64,549.0,0.36,2.0,Is that?
35501,PS4,3,549.64,551.24,1.6,3.0,"Fun, yeah."
35501,PS4,3,551.24,561.56,10.32,3.0,"And also we want NHS to to be better as well because often like these kids, they have like health issues, like they live in like multi conditions, you know, like their work, their economic."
35501,PS4,3,561.6,575.52,13.92,2.0,"Conditions slightly off topic, but if you look at poverty in society or article this morning about how they're trying to pay off people's debt in Holland who are really highly in Dutch, and they really struggle to to accept the fact that the government is trying to pay off their debt because they're sort of skeptical of government."
35501,PS4,3,575.52,579.16,3.64,2.0,"And when you go to these families, they're so they don't even open the front door to begin with."
35501,PS4,3,579.16,581.04,1.88,2.0,"There's a massive pile of other letters, obviously."
35501,PS4,3,581.04,586.04,5.0,2.0,And then there's the element of just addressing all the problems that come with these issues.
35501,PS4,3,586.04,587.52,1.48,2.0,This is the point about this case as well.
35501,PS4,3,588.04,589.36,1.32,2.0,People will have health issues.
35501,PS4,3,589.36,590.24,0.88,2.0,They're not eating properly.
35501,PS4,3,590.24,593.88,3.64,2.0,They might be obese or having diabetes mentally.
35501,PS4,3,594.64,595.24,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, exactly."
35501,PS4,3,595.24,596.64,1.4,2.0,Mental health issues.
35501,PS4,3,597.64,599.24,1.6,2.0,I don't think any of us.
35501,PS4,3,599.36,600.12,0.76,2.0,I can't do that.
35501,PS4,3,600.12,607.76,7.64,2.0,"I can't imagine what it's like to have that sort of level of hardship because it doesn't come as just a single issue, right?"
35501,PS4,3,607.76,608.4,0.64,2.0,It's part of us.
35501,PS4,3,611.28,626.2,14.92,3.0,"Yeah, I think, yeah, like if the school could be like their, their safe environment where they can get the, you know, the mental health support, there's, there's doctors on, you know, like easy access to healthcare, easy and affordable access to healthcare."
35501,PS4,3,628.76,630.84,2.08,3.0,I think that would help as well.
35501,PS4,3,631.48,631.68,0.2,3.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,631.68,632.8,1.12,3.0,It's not just schools.
35501,PS4,3,633.28,635.4,2.12,2.0,"But I do think, I think that's another point of that."
35501,PS4,3,635.56,646.36,10.8,2.0,I do think giving someone a structure helps and having if you have someone in school for longer per day as you said also including meals from before breakfast or after dinner time.
35501,PS4,3,646.44,648.52,2.08,2.0,That's probably what I would say is like the main thing you can do.
35501,PS4,3,648.92,651.72,2.8,2.0,"Have them in school for more hours per day before breakfast, after dinner."
35501,PS4,3,651.72,652.76,1.04,2.0,So about 3 meals a day.
35501,PS4,3,653.2,660.2,7.0,2.0,Feed them healthy as well but actually exactly which helps them a lot and you get the structure whilst all staying on their parents hands.
35501,PS4,3,660.2,663.52,3.32,2.0,"So in these sorts of situations, I imagine have other stuff to worry about."
35501,PS4,3,663.8,665.64,1.84,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35501,PS4,3,665.84,666.76,0.92,2.0,Would cost a fortune though.
35501,PS4,3,668.64,671.04,2.4,1.0,We would need the the creative idea for funding.
35501,PS4,3,673.12,678.2,5.08,1.0,"Yeah, I suppose it can come from the tax that parents have to pay now."
35501,PS4,3,678.56,680.72,2.16,1.0,"No, the tax that parents have to pay now."
35501,PS4,3,680.76,680.88,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
35501,PS4,3,680.88,681.92,1.04,1.0,The VAT on private school.
35501,PS4,3,681.92,682.04,0.12,1.0,Cool.
35501,PS4,3,682.04,682.16,0.12,1.0,Good.
35501,PS4,3,687.8,687.96,0.16,2.0,Stuff.
35501,PS4,3,688.12,689.88,1.76,2.0,We're solving all the world.
36143,PS6,3,10.72,12.16,1.44,1.0,To encourage people to do this.
36143,PS6,3,19.2,20.04,0.84,2.0,I got an idea.
36143,PS6,3,20.36,26.32,5.96,2.0,I I think I saw a design of the soap that is designed as a microphone.
36143,PS6,3,29.48,30.8,1.32,1.0,That's that would be great.
36143,PS6,3,31.32,32.16,0.84,1.0,That would be perfect.
36143,PS6,3,32.16,32.56,0.4,1.0,Yeah.
36143,PS6,3,35.96,37.04,1.08,1.0,That's that's cool.
36143,PS6,3,37.36,37.96,0.6,3.0,That's great.
36143,PS6,3,38.4,39.0,0.6,1.0,Yeah.
36143,PS6,3,41.24,42.08,0.84,2.0,"Yeah, they can."
36143,PS6,3,42.12,44.52,2.4,2.0,Like instead of.
36143,PS6,3,44.88,45.6,0.72,1.0,Only.
36143,PS6,3,45.6,52.24,6.64,2.0,"Using the SOAP, maybe we can develop some kind of devices."
36143,PS6,3,52.92,53.4,0.48,1.0,Like.
36143,PS6,3,54.28,59.76,5.48,2.0,The thing like karaoke?
36143,PS6,3,59.76,63.8,4.04,1.0,"In the yeah, yeah, no, I'd, I'd love the soap."
36143,PS6,3,63.8,74.84,11.04,1.0,"I did because like you could just start to create like a association between like soap because everyone uses soap or, or like the the shower gel bottle or something."
36143,PS6,3,74.84,80.08,5.24,1.0,"And like, yeah, it's to make an association treating that and singing in the shower."
36143,PS6,3,83.0,84.16,1.16,1.0,"Yeah, that sounds."
36143,PS6,3,84.84,87.56,2.72,3.0,"Really, you know like microphone or like the box or something."
36143,PS6,3,87.56,90.96,3.4,3.0,You need to sync for at least 20 minutes in in order to put the.
36143,PS6,3,91.0,91.32,0.32,1.0,Soap let's.
36143,PS6,3,92.0,93.16,1.16,3.0,Let's make it a little bit dumb.
36143,PS6,3,93.48,95.44,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, create."
36143,PS6,3,95.56,110.8,15.24,1.0,Create a soap in the shape of a microphone to implicitly remind people about these health benefits.
36143,PS6,3,112.08,115.6,3.52,1.0,The box can also include information about.
36143,PS6,3,115.6,124.0,8.4,1.0,"Oops, about is a lot."
36143,PS6,3,124.0,124.92,0.92,3.0,Of quicker typing.
36143,PS6,3,128.04,130.6,2.56,1.0,"Yeah, something like that."
36143,PS6,3,133.6,141.24,7.64,1.0,"Hopefully, maybe over time it just becomes like a cultural kind of association, except."
36143,PS6,3,142.64,143.56,0.92,2.0,Microphone.
36143,PS6,3,143.6,147.88,4.28,2.0,They can also create something like CD or vinyl.
36143,PS6,3,148.12,149.36,1.24,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36143,PS6,3,150.2,153.16,2.96,1.0,"Or the shower, you know, shower curtain."
36143,PS6,3,153.2,165.88,12.68,1.0,You can make it look like a stage curtain so you can make up the projects with this theme.
36143,PS6,3,167.96,182.16,14.2,2.0,That's so far I'm imagining the company like likes to create the all this kind of stuff based on the music and classroom.
36143,PS6,3,184.24,186.92,2.68,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
36143,PS6,3,187.16,196.24,9.08,1.0,"And I don't know, sort of shack, I don't know, it's a bit hard in the bathroom obviously that you don't want to get too many electronics in there."
36143,PS6,3,196.24,204.12,7.88,1.0,But you could have like a radio or like a or Amazon Alexa app that has like karaoke.
36143,PS6,3,219.8,237.32,17.52,1.0,"It's a good name we could come up with, but there's soap I don't know or any other products in this."
36143,PS6,3,237.36,238.04,0.68,2.0,Range.
36143,PS6,3,244.0,249.48,5.48,2.0,"I think the video is important because if you use your phone speaker, it's."
36143,PS6,3,249.52,250.32,0.8,1.0,Doesn't sound great.
36143,PS6,3,250.48,261.96,11.48,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, It's quite fun just seeing in the shower, just the echoing of the tiles and stuff."
36143,PS6,3,265.04,265.36,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36143,PS6,3,265.36,265.76,0.4,1.0,I don't know.
36143,PS6,3,265.76,266.64,0.88,1.0,I'm quite happy with this.
36143,PS6,3,267.0,268.68,1.68,1.0,"I think you, I think you hit the nail on the head."
36143,PS6,3,269.08,276.4,7.32,1.0,Like a good creative idea should go next.
36143,PS6,3,276.56,276.84,0.28,1.0,I don't know.
36143,PS6,3,276.84,278.92,2.08,1.0,"Yeah, I think."
36143,PS6,3,279.48,280.92,1.44,2.0,That's quite creative.
36143,PS6,3,282.32,283.12,0.8,1.0,Are you happy to go?
36143,PS6,3,284.36,284.64,0.28,1.0,OK.
36441,PS5,3,7.52,8.24,0.72,1.0,So let's stop.
36441,PS5,3,9.96,19.16,9.2,1.0,Try to discourage them from leaving the country.
36441,PS5,3,34.48,37.52,3.04,1.0,So why would they leave the company to dissatisfactory since?
36441,PS5,3,37.6,38.64,1.04,2.0,He's probably true.
36441,PS5,3,39.52,43.12,3.6,2.0,That's the result of the way the employer is treating them.
36441,PS5,3,44.84,47.44,2.6,1.0,So what it is the problem of the employer?
36441,PS5,3,49.0,54.76,5.76,2.0,Cause for someone that is doing a voluntary work to leave is not the paid that is the problem.
36441,PS5,3,56.12,63.24,7.12,2.0,Maybe it's coming from work satisfaction.
36441,PS5,3,64.2,71.92,7.72,2.0,Maybe the person is not satisfied with the work or the way the blood the employer is treating them.
36441,PS5,3,77.48,79.52,2.04,3.0,How to stop stop?
36441,PS5,3,80.36,85.72,5.36,2.0,"They want to employ, I think, good working conditions."
36441,PS5,3,94.64,95.88,1.24,1.0,"Well, that's only one aspect there."
36441,PS5,3,95.88,106.12,10.24,1.0,"Sometimes like, like they want a different experience or like their interests change or you know, maybe just geographical issues."
36441,PS5,3,106.16,109.56,3.4,1.0,So it's more than just bad working experience.
36441,PS5,3,110.08,115.96,5.88,1.0,I think I need some way to motivate them to stay loyal to one company instead.
36441,PS5,3,120.4,135.6,15.2,1.0,"I know like in like the big hedge fund companies, their, their payment like their salary system is like you, you get like a fixed salary and then you get bonuses that accumulate as you stay longer in the company, but you don't get those bonuses unless you stay longer."
36441,PS5,3,136.28,137.32,1.04,1.0,So that's their catch.
36441,PS5,3,139.84,150.56,10.72,1.0,"So that's what hedge fund companies do, maybe something similar like like ramping benefits as you stay longer in the company, but it could be more than financial."
36441,PS5,3,150.72,156.04,5.32,1.0,So I guess this is from a business level.
36441,PS5,3,177.4,181.08,3.68,2.0,"Yeah, put the one if you said you said something, right."
36441,PS5,3,181.52,184.28,2.76,3.0,"I think you means a bonus, no?"
36441,PS5,3,184.56,184.68,0.12,1.0,For.
36441,PS5,3,185.04,185.68,0.64,2.0,The benefits?
36441,PS5,3,186.76,201.32,14.56,1.0,"Have ramping benefits for employees that stay longer, EG pay, bonuses and."
36441,PS5,3,210.76,211.92,1.16,1.0,I don't spell consent.
36441,PS5,3,212.4,213.08,0.68,3.0,Share rewards.
36441,PS5,3,214.32,215.56,1.24,1.0,Share rewards like Yeah.
36441,PS5,3,215.72,216.44,0.72,3.0,Share rewards.
36441,PS5,3,217.2,217.52,0.32,1.0,Like.
36441,PS5,3,218.48,223.52,5.04,3.0,"If you like, if you're working five years or 10 years is always give some some other shares."
36441,PS5,3,224.48,225.16,0.68,1.0,"Oh, OK."
36441,PS5,3,225.16,230.28,5.12,1.0,So like shares?
36441,PS5,3,231.0,233.56,2.56,3.0,Depends on the the the the working.
36441,PS5,3,234.16,238.24,4.08,1.0,For people to stay for an extended.
36441,PS5,3,239.0,241.08,2.08,3.0,"OK, since others."
36441,PS5,3,244.56,245.28,0.72,1.0,Increasing.
36441,PS5,3,249.56,253.52,3.96,3.0,Certainly it depends on the company's business only.
36441,PS5,3,254.64,256.12,1.48,1.0,"Yeah, there are a lot of yeah."
36441,PS5,3,256.6,256.96,0.36,3.0,So if.
36441,PS5,3,257.8,266.76,8.96,2.0,"You, like you said, maybe they want to get experience if trainees can be organized for them where they can learn more things from the company."
36441,PS5,3,268.48,275.2,6.72,1.0,So like supports their like say that they want to get experience from this other place.
36441,PS5,3,275.2,281.68,6.48,1.0,"So give like a more flexible plan for kind of like a, you know, like exchange programs."
36441,PS5,3,281.84,290.52,8.68,1.0,"Yeah, something so relaxation."
36441,PS5,3,296.2,302.96,6.76,1.0,"Well, that's sabbaticals, I guess for employees."
36441,PS5,3,321.71,324.19,2.48,1.0,I'm not sure if this is going to get the mistake.
36441,PS5,3,328.43,329.27,0.84,1.0,"Yeah, maybe whenever."
36441,PS5,3,345.92,348.2,2.28,1.0,How do you make an employee view value?
36441,PS5,3,398.32,404.64,6.32,3.0,"More training and more, yeah, more training opportunity for the employee."
36441,PS5,3,414.24,418.68,4.44,1.0,And how does this reduce voluntary employee efficient?
36441,PS5,3,420.2,434.56,14.36,3.0,"Which is I think I learned in some technical campaign because for the for the employee, they always get some opportunity to get more course can can get the chance to learn like whatever."
36441,PS5,3,434.96,449.12,14.16,3.0,"If if you are, if you if you are cheap design company, which is you can get more other architecture and course you can learn from the outside for the external resource, which is the company pay."
36441,PS5,3,449.36,462.76,13.4,3.0,This is the means of training opportunity and also you can more chance to get more to get some certificate if in some certain area which is in the software you can get lots of the certificate.
36441,PS5,3,463.04,466.12,3.08,3.0,So which is always get some some companies support.
36441,PS5,3,466.12,474.92,8.8,3.0,And you can like if if you are accounting you are you need to get all some other other certificate and you also can support by the company.
36441,PS5,3,474.92,479.2,4.28,3.0,So which is means the company get more opportunities for the for the employees.
36441,PS5,3,479.24,481.96,2.72,3.0,This must be encouraging people to stay.
36441,PS5,3,485.64,489.16,3.52,1.0,"What would be a good like, training opportunity for accountants?"
36441,PS5,3,491.2,491.52,0.32,1.0,Yeah.
36441,PS5,3,492.24,498.56,6.32,3.0,"You know the accountants, they have the different level, which is you need to get a get a couple of certificate."
36441,PS5,3,498.92,505.76,6.84,3.0,That's also very expensive for to to to get the lesson to get the course and get the certificate.
36441,PS5,3,505.76,511.92,6.16,3.0,So it's always by the companies to to the finance support to the.
36441,PS5,3,512.6,535.6,23.0,2.0,So you can move to next.
36441,PS5,3,546.24,546.76,0.52,3.0,Samantha.
36441,PS5,3,547.36,547.76,0.4,2.0,Next.
35764,PS6,6,14.64,17.08,2.44,1.0,Do the karaoke into the yeah.
35764,PS6,6,17.28,17.44,0.16,2.0,That's.
35764,PS6,6,18.08,18.16,0.08,3.0,The.
35764,PS6,6,18.44,19.92,1.48,2.0,First thing that.
35764,PS6,6,20.36,21.08,0.72,3.0,Came into my mind.
35764,PS6,6,21.28,22.2,0.92,3.0,Am I spelling that right?
35764,PS6,6,29.16,30.4,1.24,3.0,Well does it have to be a karaoke?
35764,PS6,6,30.4,33.04,2.64,3.0,It doesn't like with a mic input and everything that's just.
35764,PS6,6,33.36,35.2,1.84,1.0,"A waterproof mic, OK yeah."
35764,PS6,6,35.24,37.68,2.44,1.0,And then the hot water doesn't come out unless.
35764,PS6,6,38.2,39.92,1.72,4.0,You see absolutely temperature function.
35764,PS6,6,50.28,50.36,0.08,2.0,Is.
35764,PS6,6,53.96,55.6,1.64,5.0,Based on volume of your voice.
35764,PS6,6,57.48,58.76,1.28,3.0,Kind of a bunch of advice.
35764,PS6,6,59.12,59.6,0.48,2.0,In tune you up.
35764,PS6,6,59.6,60.04,0.44,2.0,"Oh yes, that's right."
35764,PS6,6,61.2,61.36,0.16,2.0,Yes.
35764,PS6,6,65.72,68.08,2.36,4.0,Feeling guilty might be in some jails.
35764,PS6,6,69.6,70.36,0.76,2.0,"No, no we can't."
35764,PS6,6,82.28,83.48,1.2,4.0,And also then just be a timer.
35764,PS6,6,83.48,84.96,1.48,4.0,I said 20 minutes or longer.
35764,PS6,6,85.56,85.76,0.2,2.0,Yeah.

35764,PS6,6,94.36,95.8,1.44,5.0,Like over songs?
35764,PS6,6,96.52,99.48,2.96,5.0,"Because every modern song is only about like what, 3-4 minutes?"
35764,PS6,6,99.64,99.72,0.08,2.0,Of.
35764,PS6,6,99.84,100.04,0.2,1.0,Like the?

35764,PS6,6,104.88,105.56,0.68,5.0,Here prioritise.
35764,PS6,6,105.84,106.24,0.4,2.0,We won't.
35764,PS6,6,106.24,107.88,1.64,1.0,Pick everyone's through music.
35764,PS6,6,109.24,112.36,3.12,2.0,Don't look at I'll have to coach out.
35764,PS6,6,117.96,120.36,2.4,4.0,"But we have to keep them in the shower room for 20 minutes, right?"
35764,PS6,6,120.44,120.68,0.24,4.0,So.
35764,PS6,6,121.32,123.72,2.4,3.0,"In the shower itself, not not just the bathroom."
35764,PS6,6,123.72,126.2,2.48,4.0,"In the shower and also, well, probably in the bath as well."
35764,PS6,6,126.2,128.28,2.08,4.0,"So for 20 minutes, yeah."
35764,PS6,6,128.28,129.0,0.72,4.0,So lock it.
35764,PS6,6,129.44,131.76,2.32,1.0,Maybe we have daily challenge kind of thing.
35764,PS6,6,131.96,133.32,1.36,1.0,We give them 5 songs.
35764,PS6,6,133.32,136.12,2.8,1.0,"If we finish, we got a small, small reward."
35764,PS6,6,137.08,137.8,0.72,4.0,Like a leaderboard.
35764,PS6,6,142.2,143.16,0.96,4.0,That's what happened to Dolingo.
35764,PS6,6,144.64,144.68,0.04,5.0,Oh.
35764,PS6,6,146.56,147.6,1.04,3.0,It doesn't say it's going to be a.
35764,PS6,6,147.72,149.92,2.2,2.0,"Punishment, it just says it's good for health."
35764,PS6,6,149.92,153.4,3.48,2.0,There's nothing that's been bad is.
35764,PS6,6,153.4,153.72,0.32,3.0,Going to.
35764,PS6,6,153.88,154.2,0.32,2.0,Happen if.
35764,PS6,6,154.24,154.68,0.44,3.0,They don't.

35764,PS6,6,156.32,163.8,7.48,3.0,"In the shower or the division of, for instance, a musical lasting."
35764,PS6,6,164.28,171.64,7.36,6.0,"I think maybe a reward is better than knocking than me, but I haven't had some sort of medical issue."
35764,PS6,6,175.96,176.68,0.72,4.0,Fire hazard.
35764,PS6,6,206.28,207.72,1.44,2.0,Or a medical emergency.
35764,PS6,6,218.08,227.2,9.12,6.0,"I mean, surely if if you're the kind of person who doesn't want to sit and you just say, I don't know, you sprained your ankle or something and you hit the button and open it."
35764,PS6,6,228.6,231.56,2.96,2.0,Or you put a radio next to the waterproof mic.
35764,PS6,6,236.12,236.36,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
35764,PS6,6,236.36,238.92,2.56,2.0,How do you know it's you want some sort of voice recognition?
35764,PS6,6,238.92,241.2,2.28,2.0,It could if you live in a House of six people.

35764,PS6,6,246.96,247.72,0.76,5.0,"Yeah, different."
35764,PS6,6,247.88,248.6,0.72,2.0,People OK.
35764,PS6,6,258.08,263.0,4.92,3.0,"How do we, like, is there like another form of reward apart from like people's health to encourage people to do that?"
35764,PS6,6,263.2,268.76,5.56,3.0,Like maybe like if you complete that challenge for for like half a month then you get something else.
35764,PS6,6,269.12,270.64,1.52,5.0,"Oh, you didn't enter to a record label?"
35764,PS6,6,272.16,273.56,1.4,3.0,But not everyone wants that.
35764,PS6,6,273.64,275.68,2.04,6.0,My money off your water bill because.
35764,PS6,6,275.68,275.96,0.28,3.0,"Oh yeah, yeah."
35764,PS6,6,275.96,277.36,1.4,3.0,I don't know what water company.
35764,PS6,6,278.64,280.04,1.4,6.0,Would be happy with that.
35764,PS6,6,282.16,284.56,2.4,3.0,We probably like some company would have to like pay for it.
35764,PS6,6,284.6,287.72,3.12,3.0,I guess we work for completing.
35764,PS6,6,288.08,288.96,0.88,4.0,This is the business.
35764,PS6,6,288.96,290.48,1.52,4.0,It might be done by what the company?
35764,PS6,6,298.24,307.84,9.6,6.0,Get some complimentary air defenders for when your housemates late night you're trying to sleep.
35764,PS6,6,311.56,312.56,1.0,5.0,Noise cancelling headphones.
35764,PS6,6,323.6,323.84,0.24,2.0,"Yeah, that."
35764,PS6,6,342.97,345.73,2.76,1.0,Works and maybe we can also make it as a social campaign.
35764,PS6,6,346.65,350.09,3.44,1.0,"Maybe, you know, make celebrities to."
35764,PS6,6,351.6,351.76,0.16,3.0,"Like, oh."

35764,PS6,6,366.8,367.64,0.84,4.0,It's like the ice cream.
35764,PS6,6,367.96,368.8,0.84,1.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35764,PS6,6,368.84,369.64,0.8,1.0,I'm thinking about that.
35764,PS6,6,369.76,370.48,0.72,4.0,"I guess, yeah."
35764,PS6,6,372.2,373.0,0.8,5.0,What's the ice?
35764,PS6,6,373.36,374.0,0.64,1.0,Yeah.

35764,PS6,6,409.52,410.68,1.16,3.0,Anything else you want to add?
35764,PS6,6,425.92,427.0,1.08,2.0,That's definitely creative.
35764,PS6,6,460.4,460.96,0.56,3.0,Oh crap.
35764,PS6,6,461.2,461.64,0.44,3.0,"Oh, sorry."
35764,PS6,6,462.4,472.32,9.92,6.0,"I guess Jeff is if, if there's a particular like health benefit, whatever the study found it links because the ice bucket challenges for ALS."

35764,PS6,6,501.28,510.88,9.6,3.0,"So we have an answer that kind of goes from chaotic to or sensible, which is good like this, yeah."
34318,PS1,3,0.0,1190.36,3.32,3.0,Plastic waste is one of the biggest environmental problems of our lifetime.
34318,PS1,3,1190.36,1193.12,2.76,3.0,Please come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic.
34318,PS1,3,1193.2,1197.68,4.48,1.0,Pollution and nuclear bombs will eliminate all that plastic.
34318,PS1,3,1199.64,1200.48,0.84,3.0,"Nuclear bombs, yes."

34318,PS1,3,1209.68,1210.16,0.48,1.0,We're thinking.
34318,PS1,3,1210.16,1211.0,0.84,3.0,It is creative it.
34318,PS1,3,1211.36,1211.8,0.44,2.0,Is correct?
34318,PS1,3,1211.8,1214.2,2.4,2.0,What about plastic consuming microbes?
34318,PS1,3,1215.0,1215.48,0.48,1.0,I like that.
34318,PS1,3,1215.72,1216.2,0.48,1.0,I do like.
34318,PS1,3,1216.2,1216.92,0.72,2.0,Nanobots well.
34318,PS1,3,1217.44,1219.8,2.36,1.0,"We're kind of allowed to produce different ideas, right?"
34318,PS1,3,1219.8,1220.08,0.28,1.0,They say.
34318,PS1,3,1220.08,1221.28,1.2,1.0,One creative idea.
34318,PS1,3,1221.32,1221.52,0.2,2.0,So.
34318,PS1,3,1221.6,1222.52,0.92,2.0,But that's not an idea.
34318,PS1,3,1222.96,1224.4,1.44,2.0,I'm literally stealing this idea you.
34318,PS1,3,1224.48,1227.48,3.0,3.0,Missing up the thing each time it said come up with one.
34318,PS1,3,1228.76,1229.8,1.04,1.0,"No, but I think like, yeah, this."
34318,PS1,3,1229.8,1231.88,2.08,2.0,Is A1 idea with a three-part.
34318,PS1,3,1231.96,1232.28,0.32,1.0,Approach.
34318,PS1,3,1232.36,1235.64,3.28,1.0,"It's like if it doesn't work, we'll move the planet that's sort of ours."
34318,PS1,3,1235.84,1236.32,0.48,2.0,"No, we need."
34318,PS1,3,1236.32,1238.12,1.8,3.0,"One, yeah, I don't like the nuclear bomb."
34318,PS1,3,1239.12,1241.8,2.68,2.0,"Micro consuming, Micro consuming it."
34318,PS1,3,1241.96,1243.32,1.36,3.0,Says it's an environmental problem.
34318,PS1,3,1243.6,1244.72,1.12,3.0,Nuclear bombs would create more.
34318,PS1,3,1245.32,1247.24,1.92,1.0,"Environment, it all says reduced plastic pollution."
34318,PS1,3,1247.24,1247.6,0.36,2.0,It would.
34318,PS1,3,1247.68,1248.32,0.64,3.0,"Oh, it does."
34318,PS1,3,1248.32,1248.64,0.32,3.0,It does.
34318,PS1,3,1248.64,1248.84,0.2,3.0,It does.
34318,PS1,3,1250.56,1252.52,1.96,1.0,"Point B OK, do you think it's all clever?"
34318,PS1,3,1252.64,1257.08,4.44,2.0,"Well, OK, so plastics are a byproduct of the petrochemical industry."
34318,PS1,3,1258.04,1258.36,0.32,3.0,Yeah.
34318,PS1,3,1258.6,1263.28,4.68,2.0,So you can either stop their production or deal with their with the after effect.
34318,PS1,3,1265.0,1271.56,6.56,2.0,What do you want to do you we probably need to clean up the existing problem if we could stop supply.
34318,PS1,3,1271.6,1274.24,2.64,2.0,So just burn the rest of the world's Petro just.
34318,PS1,3,1276.0,1276.52,0.52,1.0,"Like, burn it up."
34318,PS1,3,1277.4,1278.04,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, that would solve it."
34318,PS1,3,1278.24,1279.32,1.08,2.0,"Yeah, big bonfire."
34318,PS1,3,1281.08,1284.6,3.52,3.0,Single source of Petro chemical in the world.
34318,PS1,3,1285.24,1285.52,0.28,1.0,Yes.
34318,PS1,3,1286.24,1287.12,0.88,3.0,It does stop it.
34318,PS1,3,1287.32,1288.4,1.08,3.0,It does reduce it.
34318,PS1,3,1288.44,1291.84,3.4,2.0,While simultaneously tweeting in support of Tesla.
34318,PS1,3,1292.88,1293.04,0.16,1.0,Yes.
34318,PS1,3,1294.08,1298.4,4.32,3.0,"While buying while buying shares of Tesla, yeah."
34318,PS1,3,1299.12,1309.92,10.8,2.0,"OK, so we need something novel, something that's not going to be found in the in the history of like written ideas or language plastic deal with plastics."
34318,PS1,3,1311.52,1313.28,1.76,2.0,Is it reduce the amount of?
34318,PS1,3,1313.28,1316.0,2.72,3.0,He's come up with one creative idea to reduce plastic pollution.
34318,PS1,3,1317.12,1319.4,2.28,1.0,Can we train birds to collect plastic?
34318,PS1,3,1320.28,1322.0,1.72,2.0,"Millions of no OK, I've got one."
34318,PS1,3,1322.8,1326.2,3.4,2.0,AI is not going to come up with this chain.
34318,PS1,3,1326.2,1328.84,2.64,2.0,Adopt plastic as a currency.
34318,PS1,3,1329.76,1330.8,1.04,1.0,"Oh, I like that chain A."
34318,PS1,3,1331.2,1333.68,2.48,2.0,No Adopt plastics as a currency.
34318,PS1,3,1333.76,1335.0,1.24,1.0,"Yes, as legal tender."
34318,PS1,3,1335.32,1335.6,0.28,2.0,Yes.
34318,PS1,3,1335.6,1337.12,1.52,1.0,"Global legal tender, yes."
34318,PS1,3,1337.48,1338.84,1.36,2.0,Now they have value.
34318,PS1,3,1339.88,1340.56,0.68,3.0,A global.
34318,PS1,3,1341.4,1348.32,6.92,2.0,"I mean, of course you would go and collect that giant floating plastic mat in the Pacific Ocean would become a diamond mined overnight."
34318,PS1,3,1348.96,1351.56,2.6,1.0,And that also solves the need to do any quantities.
34318,PS1,3,1352.4,1353.16,0.76,3.0,All plastics.
34318,PS1,3,1353.32,1355.32,2.0,2.0,"Do not, do not dispose of plastic."
34318,PS1,3,1355.32,1357.04,1.72,2.0,No one would throw out plastic for the rest of.
34318,PS1,3,1357.04,1359.88,2.84,3.0,Their land don't dispose.
34318,PS1,3,1359.92,1360.48,0.56,1.0,Values.
34318,PS1,3,1360.76,1363.12,2.36,3.0,Of plastics as.
34318,PS1,3,1363.64,1364.12,0.48,1.0,So you have to.
34318,PS1,3,1364.76,1365.52,0.76,3.0,It is not and.
34318,PS1,3,1365.52,1366.92,1.4,2.0,It's no longer considered but like.
34318,PS1,3,1367.56,1368.88,1.32,3.0,I'm even taking away the look.
34318,PS1,3,1368.88,1370.44,1.56,3.0,Don't buy that this is.
34318,PS1,3,1370.52,1371.12,0.6,2.0,Pollution.
34318,PS1,3,1371.76,1374.6,2.84,2.0,"This is an opportunity, right?"
34318,PS1,3,1374.6,1376.88,2.28,2.0,Nobody considers like cash on the ground pollution.
34318,PS1,3,1377.04,1377.88,0.84,1.0,It has to be enough though.
34318,PS1,3,1377.88,1379.8,1.92,1.0,The value of the bottle has to be somehow.
34318,PS1,3,1379.8,1381.12,1.32,2.0,"Performed, but we would get rid of."
34318,PS1,3,1381.12,1381.68,0.56,3.0,We would get.
34318,PS1,3,1382.4,1388.96,6.56,2.0,"First of all, this is plastic, second of all we just need to say any plastic and and second of all the."
34318,PS1,3,1389.84,1392.92,3.08,3.0,"People who just thought like breaking, like get breaking."
34318,PS1,3,1393.36,1396.16,2.8,1.0,"Like robbing the plastic factory, the novel factory."
34318,PS1,3,1396.16,1397.36,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, it's no longer pollution."
34318,PS1,3,1397.36,1398.56,1.2,2.0,That's great novel idea.
34318,PS1,3,1398.56,1399.36,0.8,2.0,"OK, resolve it."
34318,PS1,3,1399.48,1400.12,0.64,2.0,Next question.
34318,PS1,3,1400.36,1400.92,0.56,3.0,Next question.
35758,PS2,3,22.78,22.9,0.12,1.0,Right.
35758,PS2,3,23.1,24.34,1.24,1.0,How creative can you get?
35758,PS2,3,33.54,38.7,5.16,2.0,So I'm considering what exactly is the vulnerability in a supply chain?
35758,PS2,3,38.7,43.38,4.68,2.0,Does that mean maybe some part of the supply chain may break down or?
35758,PS2,3,44.6,56.64,12.04,1.0,"Oh yeah, that's, that's a good point because I thought about just as in like diligence, like, you know, some somebody losing track of stuff."
35758,PS2,3,57.48,58.52,1.04,1.0,But but that's a good point.
35758,PS2,3,58.52,61.76,3.24,1.0,"Thinking you're you're, you're thinking about machinery malfunctioning."
35758,PS2,3,62.08,62.48,0.4,1.0,That's me.
35758,PS2,3,62.48,63.96,1.48,1.0,I'm thinking about like human.
35758,PS2,3,64.6,66.16,1.56,3.0,I was thinking about internal thieves.
35758,PS2,3,66.16,66.28,0.12,3.0,OK.
35758,PS2,3,67.6,67.92,0.32,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35758,PS2,3,67.92,68.28,0.36,2.0,Human.
35758,PS2,3,68.28,68.52,0.24,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35758,PS2,3,68.76,73.24,4.48,3.0,"Yeah, because, because once I ordered a phone online by Amazon, they came with empty box."
35758,PS2,3,74.32,75.64,1.32,3.0,"Yeah, and then they offer me a."
35758,PS2,3,76.2,77.08,0.88,2.0,Return then they.
35758,PS2,3,77.56,85.92,8.36,3.0,"They offer me a return and then the box was clearly opened before from the side so they didn't break the seal, but they open from the side to get the phone out."
35758,PS2,3,86.24,89.36,3.12,1.0,"But The thing is, can you verify that it is from the supply chain?"
35758,PS2,3,89.36,90.88,1.52,1.0,Because it could be during the delivery.
35758,PS2,3,90.96,91.2,0.24,3.0,OK.
35758,PS2,3,91.56,91.8,0.24,3.0,All right.
35758,PS2,3,91.8,97.52,5.72,3.0,"So, yeah, so probably doesn't really count because the delivery doesn't count as a supply chain, does it?"
35758,PS2,3,98.6,99.68,1.08,1.0,"Yes, it does, But no."
35758,PS2,3,99.68,102.56,2.88,1.0,But it's a good point because you can never verify.
35758,PS2,3,102.6,104.0,1.4,3.0,So every single step could have.
35758,PS2,3,104.04,104.64,0.6,1.0,Some exactly.
35758,PS2,3,105.32,114.16,8.84,3.0,"Even especially for the high valued items, for example diamonds, they the diamond factories they they quite, it's quite easy to skip something out there absolutely."
35758,PS2,3,114.32,121.28,6.96,3.0,So it depends on what sort of what sort of object they are they are using the production chain for.
35758,PS2,3,121.72,129.76,8.04,1.0,"But so if we want to be general, I thought of a movie just like a tracking system, but that's not really creative, that's just logical."
35758,PS2,3,130.24,132.64,2.4,1.0,So any any ideas of how to amp it up?
35758,PS2,3,138.64,144.52,5.88,3.0,"Well, in that case you have the pole would have to replace or reduce the amount of human right."
35758,PS2,3,144.68,151.8,7.12,3.0,"So please to replace, yeah, automatically replace them with machines, all right."
35758,PS2,3,151.8,153.56,1.76,3.0,And then so that you can put cameras.
35758,PS2,3,153.96,155.24,1.28,2.0,Increase the set.
35758,PS2,3,157.16,160.0,2.84,3.0,"But but they can, I mean they fine, yeah."
35758,PS2,3,160.48,162.2,1.72,1.0,Let's let's write something down 1st and then.
35758,PS2,3,162.56,163.12,0.56,3.0,"Yeah, I'll see."
35758,PS2,3,164.96,178.16,13.2,1.0,Tell us something really scientifically about like science fiction and how that you have a tracking system and whenever something goes wrong it has a punishment kind of thing.
35758,PS2,3,178.96,185.76,6.8,3.0,"And, and also if it's all machines, then we can put lots of loads of cameras everywhere to, you know, to investigate what's going, what's going wrong."
35758,PS2,3,185.76,190.28,4.52,3.0,"But if if it's human workers, then it might be intrusive to their privacy."
35758,PS2,3,190.84,194.56,3.72,1.0,"Oh please, if they work for the company, they already signed off for them."
35758,PS2,3,195.12,196.52,1.4,1.0,"Well, there's a level of."
35758,PS2,3,197.24,198.64,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, certainly not everywhere."
35758,PS2,3,198.64,199.76,1.12,3.0,"I mean, that's true, True."
35758,PS2,3,202.0,206.68,4.68,1.0,"No, but it because the the prompt is to be creative, So what we're saying is quite logical."
35758,PS2,3,206.68,207.84,1.16,3.0,"Yeah, if you want to be."
35758,PS2,3,207.84,219.24,11.4,1.0,"Creative we can be like every time when the camera recognizes a mistake, they would punish the human you know like I don't know I've been a really not loud noise or."
35758,PS2,3,220.56,221.2,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, it makes sense."
35758,PS2,3,221.6,222.0,0.4,1.0,Flashy.
35758,PS2,3,222.32,227.08,4.76,2.0,"Not only punish, but also notice that there is a mistake so that they can fix."
35758,PS2,3,227.56,228.08,0.52,1.0,"Them, I mean, can."
35758,PS2,3,228.12,229.64,1.52,1.0,Can computers even do that now?
35758,PS2,3,230.6,231.24,0.64,2.0,I don't know.
35758,PS2,3,231.28,234.68,3.4,2.0,Can cameras really identify every mistake?
35758,PS2,3,234.76,235.56,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, that's right."
35758,PS2,3,236.16,242.2,6.04,1.0,"Because from what I've understood from, you know, way back, basically camera's just a recording device, right?"
35758,PS2,3,242.28,243.28,1.0,1.0,You need a human to.
35758,PS2,3,243.56,250.0,6.44,2.0,And you need all those like machine learning to analyse what kind of behavior is a mistake.
35758,PS2,3,250.16,252.92,2.76,2.0,"And yeah, I don't know whether it's available or not."
35758,PS2,3,253.28,254.44,1.16,1.0,"Well, that's what the creative."
35758,PS2,3,254.6,255.24,0.64,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35758,PS2,3,255.32,257.6,2.28,1.0,"Yeah, computer overload."
35758,PS2,3,259.76,272.32,12.56,3.0,And also it says inefficient delivery schedules and they they probably have a huge redundancy of everything and then try to deliver everything via multiple routes.
35758,PS2,3,273.12,273.44,0.32,2.0,Yeah.
35758,PS2,3,274.2,275.12,0.92,3.0,"But that's also logical, right?"
35758,PS2,3,275.12,276.0,0.88,3.0,It's not really creative.
35758,PS2,3,276.0,291.6,15.6,2.0,"And also it's mainly possible to have some local hubs that our products are not only stored in the main storage but also in some local areas, so that even if there is some transportation issues."
35758,PS2,3,291.96,292.2,0.24,3.0,We can.
35758,PS2,3,292.2,292.56,0.36,2.0,Still.
35758,PS2,3,292.6,293.56,0.96,3.0,Use local.
35758,PS2,3,293.92,296.84,2.92,2.0,Hub backups to ensure delivery.
35758,PS2,3,297.32,304.32,7.0,3.0,"And then their outcome might be we we also exactly the same as they are, so we are useless."
35758,PS2,3,312.6,313.04,0.44,1.0,Keep trying to.
35758,PS2,3,337.89,340.13,2.24,1.0,Did I talk about my Big Brother cameras?
35758,PS2,3,341.93,345.29,3.36,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, it's really Big Brother cameras."
35758,PS2,3,372.08,372.2,0.12,2.0,None.
35758,PS2,3,409.82,409.94,0.12,1.0,None.
35758,PS2,3,422.0,422.6,0.6,2.0,OK.
35758,PS2,3,431.16,434.16,3.0,1.0,So you're you're eliminating the need.
35758,PS2,3,435.44,438.72,3.28,2.0,"Of long, long way transportation."
35758,PS2,3,439.68,461.4,21.72,2.0,"And I believe that there exists some, you know, computer programming that can calculate what's the optimal transportation method given that I have these storage in different storage areas and how to optimally deliver to the customers."
35758,PS2,3,461.4,464.44,3.04,2.0,And I think that that's also useful.
35758,PS2,3,465.64,466.92,1.28,1.0,Are we happy with our answers?
35758,PS2,3,467.2,468.56,1.36,1.0,Do you think we should move on to the next?
35758,PS2,3,469.04,469.24,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,0.04,0.76,0.72,1.0,It's more interesting.
36105,PS3,6,1.68,5.44,3.76,2.0,"Yeah, imagine a new pandemic isn't much transmissive by saying the word sorry."
36105,PS3,6,5.64,5.76,0.12,3.0,Or.
36105,PS3,6,7.0,7.88,0.88,2.0,Die straight away?
36105,PS3,6,7.88,8.04,0.16,2.0,No.
36105,PS3,6,10.52,11.16,0.64,4.0,Idea to reduce its.
36105,PS3,6,11.36,11.56,0.2,5.0,Spread.
36105,PS3,6,13.24,18.36,5.12,3.0,"Mostly saying I apologize, Yeah, it's just just so I apologize."
36105,PS3,6,18.72,24.36,5.64,2.0,"You'd have to have some, like broadcasting on national TV or social media."
36105,PS3,6,25.44,27.44,2.0,1.0,What everyone can have like a sorry.
36105,PS3,6,27.64,28.8,1.16,2.0,"Obviously, it's going."
36105,PS3,6,29.04,31.88,2.84,3.0,To be more effective in political cultures.
36105,PS3,6,31.96,35.76,3.8,3.0,"Well, some cultures they use they don't use so often."
36105,PS3,6,37.36,38.6,1.24,4.0,"Yeah, it is very specific."
36105,PS3,6,38.68,39.96,1.28,5.0,"Yeah, it's very common."
36105,PS3,6,40.32,41.56,1.24,6.0,"Yeah, doing something wrong to somebody."
36105,PS3,6,42.72,43.72,1.0,6.0,The real teenage is to say sorry.
36105,PS3,6,44.32,49.92,5.6,1.0,"Yeah, you have like a wrist detection if it seems that you say sorry."
36105,PS3,6,50.44,55.76,5.32,2.0,"Yeah, it's quite good actually, because like, even if you told everyone not to say sorry, they just forget."
36105,PS3,6,57.04,59.92,2.88,2.0,"I mean, it's kind of inhumane to like, shock people whenever they say sorry."
36105,PS3,6,61.44,64.84,3.4,3.0,"Yeah, I think, I think you, you really took to a really good idea."
36105,PS3,6,64.88,67.76,2.88,3.0,"Someone says sorry around here, right?"
36105,PS3,6,67.96,68.76,0.8,2.0,Maybe it just buzzes.
36105,PS3,6,68.76,73.4,4.64,2.0,"It doesn't have to like hurt you, but if it's just like, yeah, just like on your ass, but you don't like that you've."
36105,PS3,6,73.4,74.56,1.16,1.0,Got to make it an old one.
36105,PS3,6,74.56,75.4,0.84,1.0,So you've got to make it.
36105,PS3,6,75.76,76.16,0.4,2.0,You know.
36105,PS3,6,77.0,80.04,3.04,3.0,"Everyone should go on, but everyone's*."
36105,PS3,6,80.2,80.64,0.44,2.0,"Sorry, but."
36105,PS3,6,82.28,85.72,3.44,4.0,But you want to stop because obviously the pandemic is spreading because of that.
36105,PS3,6,90.08,96.0,5.92,4.0,If your if your mobile can listen how many times you said sorry in a day and accordingly deduct money from your bank account.
36105,PS3,6,101.92,105.4,3.48,2.0,Because you can have your mobile phone just pauses whenever you say it.
36105,PS3,6,105.96,108.44,2.48,3.0,I know if it's a mobile phone it's not going to hurt.
36105,PS3,6,108.44,110.28,1.84,3.0,You need something that affects it directly.
36105,PS3,6,110.44,112.32,1.88,3.0,So if you lose money then.
36105,PS3,6,113.52,117.36,3.84,5.0,You stop saying it's about places.
36105,PS3,6,118.68,122.16,3.48,3.0,"Where people who have access to mobile, a person like a machinery, he says."
36105,PS3,6,122.16,123.32,1.16,3.0,So it wasn't yeah.
36105,PS3,6,123.84,124.76,0.92,3.0,"And then, yeah."
36105,PS3,6,125.28,128.0,2.72,2.0,It doesn't say anywhere that has to be financially viable.
36105,PS3,6,128.04,128.32,0.28,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,131.44,132.12,0.68,3.0,Or possible.
36105,PS3,6,132.12,133.12,1.0,3.0,"Yeah, it's a pretty much."
36105,PS3,6,133.52,135.96,2.44,3.0,"So once it was this thing, you never know."
36105,PS3,6,136.88,138.28,1.4,2.0,It's not like everyone.
36105,PS3,6,138.4,139.8,1.4,3.0,Everyone like gives you space and.
36105,PS3,6,140.48,140.8,0.32,2.0,I mean.
36105,PS3,6,140.96,142.16,1.2,3.0,Probably at the end of the month.
36105,PS3,6,142.24,143.16,0.92,3.0,You have said so much.
36105,PS3,6,143.2,143.68,0.48,3.0,I'm sorry.
36105,PS3,6,145.16,147.0,1.84,3.0,"Yeah, you could be taxed for the studies you said."
36105,PS3,6,147.4,149.28,1.88,2.0,"But don't you want, you don't want to do any financial thing."
36105,PS3,6,149.28,151.8,2.52,2.0,"You just want an immediate, like constant reminder not to say it."
36105,PS3,6,151.96,153.48,1.52,2.0,Like no one wants to spread this.
36105,PS3,6,153.6,153.8,0.2,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,153.96,156.08,2.12,3.0,Obviously it's going to be spreading.
36105,PS3,6,156.68,157.6,0.92,3.0,So what do you think they?
36105,PS3,6,158.84,162.52,3.68,2.0,"Need a constant reminder whenever they're because like everyone know not to say it, but you'd forget."
36105,PS3,6,162.52,164.28,1.76,2.0,So you just need something constant remind you.
36105,PS3,6,164.76,166.92,2.16,2.0,But I don't think that has to be like financial penalty.
36105,PS3,6,166.96,172.0,5.04,2.0,Do you not just want something the buzzes and then you just hope that everyone's going?
36105,PS3,6,172.0,172.28,0.28,3.0,To follow.
36105,PS3,6,172.32,172.68,0.36,2.0,The rules.
36105,PS3,6,173.2,175.16,1.96,1.0,"Yeah, I."
36105,PS3,6,175.88,181.4,5.52,3.0,Don't know.
36105,PS3,6,182.4,184.16,1.76,3.0,I think it's.
36105,PS3,6,185.0,187.76,2.76,1.0,A bit harsh because some people can't afford to be.
36105,PS3,6,187.92,189.24,1.32,2.0,Giving away no exactly.
36105,PS3,6,189.24,191.96,2.72,2.0,"But like kids, have you got a 2 year old?"
36105,PS3,6,191.96,193.96,2.0,2.0,They're not going to have them start paying the government.
36105,PS3,6,193.96,196.4,2.44,2.0,Like they just need signs that I don't know.
36105,PS3,6,197.48,204.4,6.92,3.0,Like it should be like a threshold because I both need say 1010 thousand a month then we have financial applications.
36105,PS3,6,206.04,208.6,2.56,4.0,Beyond the limit beyond.
36105,PS3,6,213.12,216.56,3.44,2.0,Everyone click on mute so.
36105,PS3,6,223.52,224.76,1.24,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
36105,PS3,6,230.68,234.16,3.48,3.0,"Well, it's an epidemic, so I don't think anything at all point."
36105,PS3,6,234.16,234.48,0.32,2.0,Is.
36105,PS3,6,235.96,237.04,1.08,3.0,Every major after work.
36105,PS3,6,244.92,247.96,3.04,1.0,I think having your phone buzz is probably the easiest thing to install.
36105,PS3,6,247.96,251.12,3.16,1.0,"Yeah, it's been asking and it listens to you anyway, so."
36105,PS3,6,251.16,254.56,3.4,2.0,"And you're going to capture like 70% of the population, yeah."
36105,PS3,6,255.88,258.88,3.0,1.0,"Maybe not even a, maybe not buzz, maybe a more annoying sound."
36105,PS3,6,259.28,262.04,2.76,2.0,"You ever been when there's an earthquake and it starts like, yeah."
36105,PS3,6,263.12,263.72,0.6,1.0,Something like that.
36105,PS3,6,263.72,263.96,0.24,1.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,264.32,265.48,1.16,1.0,That's actually quite terrifying.
36105,PS3,6,265.48,265.6,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,266.32,267.56,1.24,1.0,Have some really terrifying stuff.
36105,PS3,6,267.8,269.32,1.52,1.0,"Or just a text message, those texts."
36105,PS3,6,269.48,270.84,1.36,1.0,"I mean, in America they do it quite."
36105,PS3,6,270.84,271.0,0.16,2.0,A lot.
36105,PS3,6,271.84,274.56,2.72,1.0,"Yeah, just a really stern text."
36105,PS3,6,274.6,276.0,1.4,5.0,Message I'm still have your opinion.
36105,PS3,6,276.88,287.48,10.6,5.0,"Maybe in those 12 world countries where people don't have access to the iPhones, how will we be able to contribute areas that should keep you straight."
36105,PS3,6,288.08,288.72,0.64,1.0,That's why.
36105,PS3,6,289.0,293.72,4.72,3.0,The boss was something small and something I.
36105,PS3,6,293.72,297.88,4.16,5.0,Think it was just probably a particular region.
36105,PS3,6,298.24,299.0,0.76,5.0,Here you can see.
36105,PS3,6,300.44,302.92,2.48,3.0,And it usually be something that should be paid for.
36105,PS3,6,303.0,304.44,1.44,3.0,"It should be like, like healthcare."
36105,PS3,6,304.76,308.32,3.56,3.0,"So long as you're able to access any primary healthcare, you should be installed."
36105,PS3,6,308.48,310.52,2.04,3.0,You should be installed in your hair like bracelets.
36105,PS3,6,310.64,310.76,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,311.04,311.92,0.88,3.0,What you say sorry.
36105,PS3,6,311.92,312.12,0.2,3.0,And.
36105,PS3,6,312.68,326.84,14.16,4.0,"The mobile phone idea may not be bad because a lot of emerging or countries also there were a lot of success with mobile phone penetration, yeah, so it may not be that big of a concern."
36105,PS3,6,327.16,329.8,2.64,2.0,We can just say that like it's English.
36105,PS3,6,329.8,330.24,0.44,2.0,Sorry.
36105,PS3,6,330.24,333.0,2.76,2.0,And I thought we're kind of limited to English speaking first.
36105,PS3,6,333.4,333.84,0.44,3.0,Actually.
36105,PS3,6,334.72,335.08,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
36105,PS3,6,335.12,336.84,1.72,2.0,But that proportion is going to be a bit higher.
36105,PS3,6,337.2,339.92,2.72,2.0,"Yeah, I think we should go over the mobile phone thing."
36105,PS3,6,340.0,342.04,2.04,2.0,"Like, yeah, it doesn't have to reduce it completely."
36105,PS3,6,342.04,342.8,0.76,2.0,It just has to reduce.
36105,PS3,6,342.96,346.96,4.0,4.0,"It because the thing with the band is, again, you need somebody to produce it."
36105,PS3,6,347.04,348.88,1.84,4.0,"Yeah, you need a distribution chain, yeah."
36105,PS3,6,349.12,350.64,1.52,4.0,So that it reaches every person.
36105,PS3,6,350.84,352.04,1.2,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, you just."
36105,PS3,6,352.04,353.6,1.56,4.0,Take it off mobile phone app it's easy.
36105,PS3,6,353.6,356.24,2.64,4.0,You just advise everyone download this on your phone.
36105,PS3,6,357.64,358.56,0.92,3.0,You have to have like.
36105,PS3,6,360.08,360.8,0.72,5.0,An alarm session.
36105,PS3,6,362.6,363.68,1.08,4.0,How would that work OK?
36105,PS3,6,364.56,375.72,11.16,5.0,"Let's decrease those as you usually have cameras in the streets probably when somebody says that, sorry, kind of resistance."
36105,PS3,6,377.04,377.16,0.12,3.0,And.
36105,PS3,6,379.12,387.6,8.48,1.0,I guess the problem with that is it become might introduce blame culture because if you say sorry then alarm goes off over that.
36105,PS3,6,389.16,390.56,1.4,1.0,I can't believe you did that.
36105,PS3,6,391.52,395.16,3.64,1.0,So then it will get a bit could get a bit hostile.
36105,PS3,6,395.72,403.28,7.56,2.0,"If everything is completely free, apart from like a little bit of outcome investment, if you have is developing the app and then it's it's going to capture like so many people."
36105,PS3,6,403.76,406.0,2.24,2.0,You can't take it off because like everyone wants to onto the phone.
36105,PS3,6,406.0,406.92,0.92,2.0,You can take a break it off.
36105,PS3,6,408.08,413.04,4.96,2.0,"It's like really simple because it's like it's so obvious, like there's nothing that you can misinterpret."
36105,PS3,6,413.08,415.6,2.52,2.0,Do you think that makes the most sense?
36105,PS3,6,416.92,417.72,0.8,2.0,Like initially?
36105,PS3,6,419.16,428.32,9.16,4.0,"Or you can qualify our answer by saying for example, the mobile phone idea only applicable in English speaking countries, something like that."
36105,PS3,6,428.32,436.16,7.84,4.0,So probably we can everybody's on board with that.
36105,PS3,6,451.28,458.84,7.56,4.0,"Are we having the the financial implication or no, we are not saying not the OR it just buzzes basically."
36105,PS3,6,479.2,479.64,0.44,1.0,Maybe.
36105,PS3,6,490.32,493.44,3.12,3.0,"You know, it's like a pandemic business course, she says."
36105,PS3,6,493.56,495.44,1.88,3.0,Really against whatever.
36105,PS3,6,495.72,496.24,0.52,2.0,That anyone?
36105,PS3,6,496.24,499.04,2.8,2.0,I assume it's like anyone that hears the word so a.
36105,PS3,6,503.32,505.2,1.88,1.0,Little bit like a disturbing alert.
36105,PS3,6,532.62,534.1,1.48,4.0,Anything else listening to add?
34348,PS3,3,17.52,22.6,5.08,1.0,Imagine a new pandemic has emerged that is transmitted by saying the word sorry.
34348,PS3,3,24.64,24.76,0.12,2.0,And.
34348,PS3,3,25.52,26.28,0.76,1.0,"Yeah, it produces."
34348,PS3,3,26.48,26.88,0.4,3.0,But I need to.
34348,PS3,3,26.88,27.16,0.28,2.0,Be told.
34348,PS3,3,28.12,30.56,2.44,1.0,Tell women to stop apologising.
34348,PS3,3,31.36,32.88,1.52,1.0,That should do the trick to say.
34348,PS3,3,33.24,35.12,1.88,2.0,"No apologies instead of sorry, no."
34348,PS3,3,36.04,43.48,7.44,3.0,"Apologies, we should infiltrate a really asshole culture that we just don't say sorry to each other at all."
34348,PS3,3,43.48,45.12,1.64,3.0,Just change the culture completely.
34348,PS3,3,45.24,45.88,0.64,1.0,Or.
34348,PS3,3,46.24,47.48,1.24,2.0,Take Canada to get lost.
34348,PS3,3,49.28,49.84,0.56,1.0,If you'd say.
34348,PS3,3,51.2,52.68,1.48,3.0,"No, I think of negotiation professor."
34348,PS3,3,52.68,53.44,0.76,3.0,He's still Canadian.
34348,PS3,3,53.64,57.8,4.12,1.0,"So use a if we use a different language, because it's if it's, sorry."
34348,PS3,3,57.8,59.12,1.32,3.0,"As in the English word, sorry."
34348,PS3,3,59.84,66.36,6.52,1.0,"Because truthfully, if, if, if even the word sounds, if you're in India, don't wear that dress."
34348,PS3,3,66.36,67.56,1.2,1.0,What are you going to do?
34348,PS3,3,68.32,75.16,6.84,1.0,"So you so you just have to replace this word, these order of letters and that that these sounds."
34348,PS3,3,75.16,77.88,2.72,2.0,So it becomes Ori Ori's.
34348,PS3,3,78.2,83.2,5.0,1.0,"Ori, ori, or yes, you'd have to make up a new word."
34348,PS3,3,85.32,87.12,1.8,1.0,One creative idea is to make up a new word.
34348,PS3,3,87.12,88.84,1.72,1.0,Another is to have an household culture.
34348,PS3,3,89.2,90.36,1.16,3.0,And what else?
34348,PS3,3,90.56,92.92,2.36,1.0,"Another is a humble apology, so basically similar to like."
34348,PS3,3,93.32,95.52,2.2,2.0,"Yeah, just change the word but like have the same."
34348,PS3,3,95.52,96.08,0.56,1.0,Meaning I guess.
34348,PS3,3,96.12,96.96,0.84,2.0,Same thing like you said.
34348,PS3,3,97.52,101.64,4.12,3.0,"Or create a culture where every time someone says sorry, you're allowed to slap them on their face."
34348,PS3,3,102.04,102.28,0.24,1.0,What?
34348,PS3,3,102.28,105.04,2.76,1.0,What was your agreeable miss?
34348,PS3,3,105.8,107.84,2.04,2.0,I'm solving the time by slapping.
34348,PS3,3,109.96,110.4,0.44,3.0,"Oh, no."
34348,PS3,3,110.76,113.48,2.72,3.0,"Oh, but this disease will still spread in that way."
34348,PS3,3,113.48,114.08,0.6,3.0,You're right.
34348,PS3,3,114.16,114.48,0.32,3.0,OK.
34348,PS3,3,114.48,115.24,0.76,3.0,My apologies.
34348,PS3,3,116.52,117.44,0.92,1.0,Humble apologies.
34348,PS3,3,118.44,119.32,0.88,3.0,Humble apologies.
34348,PS3,3,119.84,129.24,9.4,1.0,"He used to think, I feel like a lot of people will still say sorry by accident, so they have to have to cover up what's sorry sauce Like does that count?"
34348,PS3,3,129.24,129.76,0.52,1.0,Like what?
34348,PS3,3,129.76,137.32,7.56,1.0,"What does it does It does it is it is it transmitted from just start assuming that it's just the word, the sound, sorry."
34348,PS3,3,138.52,147.48,8.96,2.0,"Bam, like you train people like you push them and then then you train them not to say sorry, but the behavioural change."
34348,PS3,3,147.6,156.44,8.84,3.0,"Yes, but the goal, eventual goal, is that we don't want to spread the pandemic, so why can't we only write one?"
34348,PS3,3,156.48,161.48,5.0,3.0,"Like if if they let me write 10, I'll write 10 the only one and then we have to be AI."
34348,PS3,3,161.48,163.36,1.88,2.0,Maybe asshole culture is the way to go.
34348,PS3,3,165.48,182.44,16.96,1.0,Who I guess like I think I think adopting another languages way of apologizing is the easiest way because how do you say it in Spanish for example?
34348,PS3,3,183.52,183.96,0.44,3.0,Mescousa.
34348,PS3,3,184.4,185.44,1.04,1.0,"Oh, but that's Italian I."
34348,PS3,3,185.44,185.88,0.44,3.0,Thought that was.
34348,PS3,3,186.04,186.76,0.72,2.0,Excuse me?
34348,PS3,3,187.04,187.72,0.68,3.0,"Oh, well, whatever."
34348,PS3,3,187.72,188.12,0.4,3.0,I don't know.
34348,PS3,3,188.32,188.96,0.64,3.0,Something like that.
34348,PS3,3,189.12,189.36,0.24,3.0,Yeah.
34348,PS3,3,189.56,190.64,1.08,3.0,Do they say that at all?
34348,PS3,3,192.36,192.8,0.44,2.0,I don't know.
34348,PS3,3,192.8,196.72,3.92,2.0,"I mean, how do you say it in Hindi shama?"
34348,PS3,3,198.16,198.92,0.76,3.0,Sounds beautiful to.
34348,PS3,3,199.08,207.72,8.64,1.0,Say it in Arabic Asif Asif which is simple Asif and to say it in Chinese I only know.
34348,PS3,3,207.92,208.56,0.64,2.0,Tibichi.
34348,PS3,3,209.84,210.68,0.84,1.0,That's all I know.
34348,PS3,3,210.76,211.48,0.72,1.0,Is there a way?
34348,PS3,3,211.72,212.76,1.04,3.0,There's three syllable.
34348,PS3,3,212.76,213.52,0.76,3.0,"Oh, Qian."
34348,PS3,3,214.16,214.8,0.64,1.0,What does that mean?
34348,PS3,3,215.52,225.36,9.84,3.0,"Also sorry, just like with apologies but I I like the sound of the Arabic or the Hindi words."
34348,PS3,3,226.32,227.8,1.48,2.0,"Yeah, but any, any language, right?"
34348,PS3,3,227.8,229.08,1.28,2.0,"Yeah, you can just say any language."
34348,PS3,3,229.08,230.96,1.88,2.0,We can take the like the word.
34348,PS3,3,231.12,231.56,0.44,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS3,3,231.88,232.28,0.4,2.0,And then you.
34348,PS3,3,232.28,234.92,2.64,3.0,Sound and then you get a fine if you speak that in English.
34348,PS3,3,235.28,238.24,2.96,1.0,"You've got a fine, you know, like, I guess so."
34348,PS3,3,238.76,240.64,1.88,3.0,"Like you know, you had to put on mask and stuff."
34348,PS3,3,241.32,241.44,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS3,3,241.92,242.4,0.48,2.0,Change your piece.
34348,PS3,3,242.76,246.72,3.96,3.0,"Wait, in that case you put on a mask and a few few traits the sound so it beeps it."
34348,PS3,3,248.76,248.84,0.08,2.0,Out.
34348,PS3,3,249.4,250.12,0.72,3.0,"Beeps it out, beep."
34348,PS3,3,251.12,251.8,0.68,3.0,Something like that.
34348,PS3,3,251.88,252.56,0.68,1.0,"Yes, well."
34348,PS3,3,253.12,253.64,0.52,2.0,That's nice.
34348,PS3,3,253.72,254.04,0.32,2.0,"Yeah, like."
34348,PS3,3,255.72,261.76,6.04,1.0,"Yes, wear a mask that translates any sound of sorry to another."
34348,PS3,3,262.88,263.32,0.44,3.0,"Language, yes."
34348,PS3,3,263.92,264.48,0.56,3.0,Another like.
34348,PS3,3,264.48,267.12,2.64,1.0,"If they hear you say sorry, they've got to."
34348,PS3,3,267.56,268.44,0.88,1.0,They've got to change that.
34348,PS3,3,268.68,270.0,1.32,1.0,Change that up immediately.
34348,PS3,3,270.24,272.76,2.52,1.0,"It's like the way Alexa listens to you, okay?"
34348,PS3,3,273.48,273.88,0.4,3.0,"Oh, right."
34348,PS3,3,274.0,274.68,0.68,3.0,I like that.
34348,PS3,3,274.84,276.28,1.44,3.0,"I actually wanna, actually wanna."
34348,PS3,3,276.28,278.4,2.12,3.0,I need to stop saying story as a woman.
34348,PS3,3,278.72,280.24,1.52,3.0,"But it just, it comes so natural."
34348,PS3,3,280.24,280.56,0.32,2.0,It's.
34348,PS3,3,280.6,281.16,0.56,1.0,Very natural.
34348,PS3,3,281.28,281.4,0.12,1.0,Yeah.
34348,PS3,3,281.6,282.24,0.64,1.0,Here's my thing.
34348,PS3,3,282.24,282.48,0.24,1.0,It's not.
34348,PS3,3,282.6,282.92,0.32,2.0,Your fault.
34348,PS3,3,282.92,283.52,0.6,2.0,"You play well, I'm sorry."
34348,PS3,3,283.84,284.48,0.64,1.0,I think it's.
34348,PS3,3,284.52,288.88,4.36,1.0,"If you are sorry, let me finish."
34348,PS3,3,289.2,291.96,2.76,3.0,"Yes, I need to be like Kristen Moore."
34348,PS3,3,291.96,295.32,3.36,3.0,"Seriously, I need the confidence."
34348,PS3,3,296.16,296.96,0.8,2.0,Walk in.
34348,PS3,3,297.44,298.32,0.88,2.0,Do that Kristen walk.
34348,PS3,3,298.64,298.92,0.28,1.0,I can't.
34348,PS3,3,299.52,300.68,1.16,3.0,Walk and I freaking own this room.
34348,PS3,3,301.32,310.92,9.6,1.0,"It was, I think so I was thinking about this because sorry is a very feminine way of speaking and for and I, I don't love that people or like women stop saying sorry."
34348,PS3,3,311.16,314.6,3.44,1.0,"Like men don't apologize, but I don't think men are so good at communicating."
34348,PS3,3,315.24,315.96,0.72,1.0,Exactly.
34348,PS3,3,316.0,317.16,1.16,1.0,So I think it's two things.
34348,PS3,3,317.16,325.44,8.28,1.0,"It's like, if you are genuinely remorseful every time you're saying sorry and you truly feel like you've got some blame in this, then that should change."
34348,PS3,3,325.56,329.16,3.6,1.0,"But if you are using sorry more as a tactic, you know what I mean."
34348,PS3,3,329.8,331.2,1.4,1.0,"To soften, soften."
34348,PS3,3,331.28,332.36,1.08,3.0,And I say you cannot play.
34348,PS3,3,332.96,341.96,9.0,1.0,"Yeah, It's like, sorry, Is that because sometimes you're apologizing, but you're really just trying, You're really just getting your point across in a way that I'm sorry."
34348,PS3,3,342.04,342.52,0.48,2.0,You're a Dick.
34348,PS3,3,342.64,344.76,2.12,1.0,"Yeah, like palatable, right."
34348,PS3,3,344.92,348.08,3.16,1.0,"Like it's, it's sort of like Monroe goes, oh, sorry."
34348,PS3,3,348.08,350.56,2.48,1.0,"Like what I'm hearing is this and you know, exactly."
34348,PS3,3,350.56,351.72,1.16,1.0,She knows what she's talking about.
34348,PS3,3,351.84,355.44,3.6,1.0,This is just her way of softening that I think.
34348,PS3,3,355.44,356.24,0.8,3.0,That's a good point.
34348,PS3,3,356.24,368.04,11.8,1.0,"And like women's way, not only is women's way of communicating have its own talents, but also the way that people accept women's way of communicating will be different than how they accept what a man's way of communicating."
34348,PS3,3,369.48,370.68,1.2,3.0,"Yeah, you know what I mean."
34348,PS3,3,371.08,374.12,3.04,3.0,"But that's the one thing I noticed you, Rebecca."
34348,PS3,3,374.12,375.2,1.08,3.0,I barely noticed you guys.
34348,PS3,3,375.4,376.12,0.72,3.0,Do you say sorry?
34348,PS3,3,376.2,379.2,3.0,3.0,I I don't notice you 2 speaks like say sorry at all.
34348,PS3,3,379.36,395.48,16.12,1.0,"I don't when I'm in a small group and I'm trying to get something across where I likely have an idea, I know I won't get very far if I just go, I'm forcing this through."
34348,PS3,3,395.52,398.76,3.24,1.0,"So it's like if I say I was like, let me get this right."
34348,PS3,3,398.76,400.76,2.0,1.0,"I was like, sorry, let's roll back."
34348,PS3,3,401.84,403.44,1.6,1.0,"Is it this, this and this?"
34348,PS3,3,404.12,406.84,2.72,1.0,"And I'm pretty 90% sure, yes, right."
34348,PS3,3,406.84,409.28,2.44,1.0,"And then be like, yeah, I was like, OK, now here's my ideas."
34348,PS3,3,409.88,425.36,15.48,1.0,"So I use sorry as a means of being palatable because if I'm too confident as a woman and I'm not enjoyable, that's why I have to be enjoyable because I'm strong if otherwise I used to be strong and not enjoyable and it wasn't good for me."
34348,PS3,3,425.6,431.12,5.52,1.0,"So if you're not a fucking delight as you're leading, then they're not happy to see you do it."
34348,PS3,3,431.52,433.0,1.48,1.0,And you never know a mixed crowd.
34348,PS3,3,433.0,436.4,3.4,1.0,"If you're with confident people, confident guys, like they have no problem with it."
34348,PS3,3,436.68,440.36,3.68,1.0,And some people try to steamroll over you and then you can't apologize to them.
34348,PS3,3,440.84,442.6,1.76,1.0,You can't apologize to the steamrollers.
34348,PS3,3,442.76,448.96,6.2,1.0,"If you if someone's like really smart and secure and they're still like they're just they're just like going ahead, then you can, you know, say sorry."
34348,PS3,3,448.96,449.84,0.88,1.0,Let me just roll back.
34348,PS3,3,449.92,450.76,0.84,1.0,I don't understand.
34348,PS3,3,450.76,459.44,8.68,1.0,I often like will eek in a little self deprecation because I know I come across.
34348,PS3,3,459.44,459.6,0.16,3.0,Very.
34348,PS3,3,459.6,469.8,10.2,3.0,"But if the other person's an asshole, I mean, I try to not, I try to not let those people, like just be like be OK with the way they are."
34348,PS3,3,470.2,477.52,7.32,3.0,"Because whenever I encounter those people, I try my best to, you know, not be so polite to them just so they know that OK, like the younger generation won't take your shit."
34348,PS3,3,477.52,485.04,7.52,1.0,"Out right, I think it's a good way to be firm, you know, and it's, it's tough because I think I think you communicate really well."
34348,PS3,3,485.24,493.56,8.32,1.0,"You know, I think you're, you've got you just kind of come up with bright ideas and you don't, I don't, I, at least from what I'm, I hear or see, you don't seem hindered."
34348,PS3,3,493.68,503.12,9.44,1.0,"But maybe you are like monitoring how you're saying things or what you're saying because you're in a certain environment, like maybe I'm only seeing, you know, 80% of the things you'd like to say."
34348,PS3,3,503.12,504.84,1.72,1.0,Do you think so?
34348,PS3,3,505.68,515.16,9.48,3.0,"I feel like sometimes even if I say something, I feel like I'm being assertive, but I always like, doubt myself, like being like, oh, am I being too pushy?"
34348,PS3,3,515.16,517.76,2.6,3.0,"Am I like, you know, am I not being agreeable?"
34348,PS3,3,517.76,518.56,0.8,3.0,I worry about that.
34348,PS3,3,518.6,524.88,6.28,3.0,"I don't know if that like, you know, that kind of communicates where you're saying that."
34348,PS3,3,525.2,525.68,0.48,3.0,Yeah.
34348,PS3,3,527.24,528.36,1.12,1.0,I don't think you have to worry about it.
34348,PS3,3,528.52,529.76,1.24,1.0,"Yeah, because you know what it is."
34348,PS3,3,529.76,534.92,5.16,1.0,Is that like it's always like you're the rest of your behavior that also speaks to like how you are in that moment.
34348,PS3,3,535.36,538.72,3.36,1.0,"So maybe if people don't know you, they might see black, white."
34348,PS3,3,539.08,543.84,4.76,1.0,"But if we've all spent so much time together, they know where your heart is at."
34348,PS3,3,543.84,545.68,1.84,1.0,They know the kind of person you are.
34348,PS3,3,546.0,557.92,11.92,1.0,"So that way when you are speaking about in your ideas, they're not thinking, oh, Yonzi's pushy, they're thinking Yonzi's refreshing, she's excited."
34348,PS3,3,558.12,558.48,0.36,1.0,Thank you.
34348,PS3,3,558.64,559.44,0.8,1.0,You know what I mean?
34348,PS3,3,559.52,561.08,1.56,1.0,That's what I think and that's important.
34348,PS3,3,561.08,568.0,6.92,1.0,"That's that's why your behaviour matters outside of whatever conversation you're having, because then people have context to where you're coming from."
34348,PS3,3,568.12,569.52,1.4,3.0,"Yeah, we."
34348,PS3,3,569.96,570.64,0.68,1.0,Like we.
34348,PS3,3,571.24,575.16,3.92,3.0,"Like this topic, it's so like, yeah, so really a mask."
34348,PS3,3,575.16,578.32,3.16,1.0,That filters sorry and change.
34348,PS3,3,578.36,586.36,8.0,1.0,That detects and filter sorry and changes word to another language.
34348,PS3,3,587.12,587.72,0.6,1.0,Is that OK?
34348,PS3,3,588.36,588.92,0.56,3.0,I like that.
34348,PS3,3,589.28,591.84,2.56,3.0,Alright that that was a good one.
36255,PS5,3,26.6,26.92,0.32,1.0,OK.
36255,PS5,3,28.64,31.28,2.64,1.0,So you might see voluntary attrition.
36255,PS5,3,31.56,32.32,0.76,1.0,What does that mean?
36255,PS5,3,33.32,33.88,0.56,2.0,I don't know I'm.
36255,PS5,3,34.6,34.84,0.24,3.0,Not sure.
36255,PS5,3,36.32,36.8,0.48,2.0,Let me check.
36255,PS5,3,36.92,37.36,0.44,1.0,Please attrition.
36255,PS5,3,37.36,39.08,1.72,1.0,I don't know any of voluntary attrition.
36255,PS5,3,39.64,39.76,0.12,2.0,Same.
36255,PS5,3,46.44,54.4,7.96,3.0,"Thing, according to the description, is got an employee deciding to leave the company voluntarily."

36255,PS5,3,156.88,167.24,10.36,1.0,"So I can just say as only we are in the same organization and I have intention of leaving the company like voluntarily, I just want to leave the company."

34785,PS5,6,911.48,912.32,0.84,5.0,And then non-stop.
34785,PS5,6,912.36,912.64,0.28,5.0,"Yeah, you."
34785,PS5,6,912.64,913.44,0.8,4.0,Don't want their men.
34785,PS5,6,913.44,914.44,1.0,4.0,Their minds are just there.
34785,PS5,6,914.44,916.72,2.28,4.0,"And you, like, tap into it with Neuralink, Yeah."
34785,PS5,6,917.28,917.8,0.52,2.0,I like that.
34785,PS5,6,917.8,918.2,0.4,2.0,I like that.
34785,PS5,6,918.2,918.32,0.12,2.0,Yeah.
34785,PS5,6,918.32,918.72,0.4,2.0,"OK, let's see."
34785,PS5,6,919.92,920.24,0.32,5.0,Neuralink.
34785,PS5,6,920.76,921.16,0.4,4.0,There you go.
34785,PS5,6,921.16,921.72,0.56,4.0,No one needs.
34785,PS5,6,921.72,922.0,0.28,4.0,"Yeah, I like."
34785,PS5,6,922.2,922.6,0.4,2.0,That I like that.
34785,PS5,6,923.92,929.32,5.4,2.0,Like a variation of that is that you inject something with the poison and you only get the antidote if you come back for work the next day.
34785,PS5,6,929.44,931.16,1.72,5.0,"Yes, yes, well, that's good too."
34785,PS5,6,931.2,931.56,0.36,5.0,Like a virus.
34785,PS5,6,932.96,933.52,0.56,2.0,The whole day.
34785,PS5,6,937.68,944.04,6.36,5.0,I like the antidote for the comeback for.
34785,PS5,6,945.2,946.36,1.16,4.0,That sounds good.
34785,PS5,6,948.48,957.04,8.56,2.0,"Yeah, imagine if this is like a actually like a sort of, you know, when they have these studies where they they tell the participants that it's about this, but it's actually behind the scenes, there's another behavior they're looking into."
34785,PS5,6,957.04,957.44,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
34785,PS5,6,957.44,961.0,3.56,2.0,"This behavior is like, you know, the ruthlessness of humans and their."
34785,PS5,6,961.04,961.84,0.8,2.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34785,PS5,6,961.88,966.0,4.12,2.0,"You know, they're gonna listen to our conversations and like, Oh yeah, they're gonna write us on a scale of how like this."
34785,PS5,6,966.2,972.88,6.68,5.0,Is what they're probably checking how narcissistic and sadistic they.
34785,PS5,6,972.92,973.36,0.44,1.0,Got the right.
34785,PS5,6,976.12,983.56,7.44,5.0,"But And Then There Were None was also a drama here in Cambridge that we went to Arya and all of us went, yeah, seen it."
34785,PS5,6,986.6,987.48,0.88,5.0,And Then There Were None.
34785,PS5,6,987.68,990.52,2.84,1.0,It's it's a movie at the like in.
34785,PS5,6,990.76,991.52,0.76,5.0,Front of Not Here.
34785,PS5,6,991.72,993.96,2.24,5.0,"It's yeah, very proud of this."
34785,PS5,6,995.72,996.52,0.8,5.0,But it was beautiful.
34785,PS5,6,996.64,997.64,1.0,5.0,It's such a good book.
34785,PS5,6,997.88,999.64,1.76,4.0,It's we tell people that they've been poisoned.
34785,PS5,6,1000.08,1001.36,1.28,5.0,"No, no, no."
34785,PS5,6,1001.4,1002.16,0.76,5.0,"But we have to, yeah."
34785,PS5,6,1002.44,1004.4,1.96,2.0,"Yeah, they need, they need to feel, they need to come back."
34785,PS5,6,1004.44,1007.88,3.44,4.0,"Yeah, because otherwise someone's going to be like, what if they sick?"
34785,PS5,6,1008.8,1009.32,0.52,1.0,"Oh, that's not."
34785,PS5,6,1009.84,1010.0,0.16,5.0,True.
34785,PS5,6,1010.0,1010.44,0.44,5.0,"OK, sorry."
34785,PS5,6,1010.44,1011.92,1.48,5.0,I think I'm from Fairmont's perspective.
34785,PS5,6,1011.92,1014.0,2.08,5.0,Like they should never know that they're addicted.
34785,PS5,6,1015.0,1016.24,1.24,5.0,They should figure out if they have I.
34785,PS5,6,1016.6,1020.6,4.0,4.0,Suppose the whole point of this is you basically give them no other option but to come to work unless.
34785,PS5,6,1020.96,1021.4,0.44,1.0,Yes.
34785,PS5,6,1024.72,1027.64,2.92,5.0,"But then if they come back to work the next day and they get the antidote, then they're fine."
34785,PS5,6,1027.76,1034.56,6.8,2.0,"But they only, they get the antidote for for 24 hours, but then they get the poison at the same time, you know, it's like, here's another 24 hours, you know, it's a little."
34785,PS5,6,1034.88,1035.16,0.28,3.0,How do you?
34785,PS5,6,1035.28,1036.52,1.24,4.0,Spell poison again P.
34785,PS5,6,1036.64,1037.8,1.16,5.0,UISON.
34785,PS5,6,1039.8,1040.56,0.76,4.0,Why does that look wrong?
34785,PS5,6,1040.56,1040.72,0.16,4.0,Looks.
34785,PS5,6,1040.88,1041.8,0.92,5.0,Like you've not used it.
34785,PS5,6,1042.88,1043.2,0.32,4.0,Recently.
34785,PS5,6,1043.2,1046.68,3.48,4.0,"No, no, you know, Unfortunately not."
34785,PS5,6,1048.08,1052.32,4.24,2.0,"It's, it's interesting is the poison can be tailored per company because it means you can't even go to a different company, right?"
34785,PS5,6,1052.32,1055.12,2.8,2.0,You have to go to the same company because they have a special antidote poison.
34785,PS5,6,1056.48,1059.2,2.72,5.0,Poison in Cambridge will not work for the poison in the box.
34785,PS5,6,1060.72,1062.08,1.36,2.0,"All my supervisors in here, they'll."
34785,PS5,6,1064.76,1065.48,0.72,5.0,Keep you back longer.
34785,PS5,6,1067.32,1069.52,2.2,2.0,"Justin, you don't know what I put into your tea last night."
34785,PS5,6,1069.6,1072.32,2.72,2.0,You know better.
34785,PS5,6,1072.32,1073.44,1.12,2.0,Get that paper published.
34785,PS5,6,1074.0,1079.0,5.0,5.0,"Yeah, I can see this actually happening in the show you on Netflix."
34785,PS5,6,1079.6,1080.24,0.64,1.0,The creepy guy.
34785,PS5,6,1080.92,1081.76,0.84,5.0,Who stalks the girls?
34785,PS5,6,1081.76,1082.32,0.56,5.0,Have you guys seen that?
34785,PS5,6,1082.4,1082.44,0.04,5.0,Oh.
34785,PS5,6,1082.56,1083.16,0.6,2.0,"Yeah, I know that."
34785,PS5,6,1083.16,1083.52,0.36,2.0,I know that.
34785,PS5,6,1083.52,1083.68,0.16,2.0,Sure.
34785,PS5,6,1083.72,1084.4,0.68,2.0,"Yeah, that's all."
34785,PS5,6,1084.4,1084.64,0.24,2.0,Yeah.
34785,PS5,6,1085.04,1085.64,0.6,5.0,"On Dexter, right?"
34785,PS5,6,1085.84,1088.84,3.0,2.0,"Yes, yes, totally a Dexter move."
34785,PS5,6,1098.04,1102.24,4.2,2.0,"I guess after this, there's like a quiz we're going to fill or not quiz, but like I think information on ourselves and all that."
34785,PS5,6,1102.32,1108.4,6.08,2.0,"I wonder if they sort of pair that with like the answers we gave, you know, like we notice people from the math department are a bit more so this."
34785,PS5,6,1112.08,1113.88,1.8,1.0,I don't know because they don't know our names.
34785,PS5,6,1114.36,1116.24,1.88,1.0,"Yeah, But I but I but I do think."
34785,PS5,6,1116.32,1117.16,0.84,1.0,What do you think?
34785,PS5,6,1117.16,1118.84,1.68,1.0,"It's not what that seems to be, Yeah."
34785,PS5,6,1121.92,1122.28,0.36,5.0,"OK, OK, nice."
34785,PS5,6,1124.64,1125.0,0.36,1.0,Wasn't it?
34785,PS5,6,1125.08,1126.2,1.12,1.0,Wasn't there only three?
34785,PS5,6,1126.64,1129.52,2.88,5.0,"You know, there's one more with like random thing."
34785,PS5,6,1129.52,1129.88,0.36,5.0,"Yeah, this."
34785,PS5,6,1130.36,1130.52,0.16,4.0,One.
34498,PS2,3,0.0,1148.44,5.04,1.0,Vulnerabilities within a supply chain could lead to uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules.
34498,PS2,3,1148.44,1151.84,3.4,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security.
34498,PS2,3,1152.32,1159.52,7.2,1.0,"I like, I feel like it would have been good to have a better understanding of if these need to be like actual realistic solutions."
34498,PS2,3,1160.04,1161.56,1.52,1.0,I'm taking that as a no.
34498,PS2,3,1161.56,1162.2,0.64,1.0,"Yeah, but."
34498,PS2,3,1165.0,1167.08,2.08,3.0,Maybe this time we can do more realistic.
34498,PS2,3,1167.28,1168.16,0.88,3.0,"Well, already do."
34498,PS2,3,1168.16,1169.28,1.12,3.0,Already did too.
34498,PS2,3,1169.28,1170.24,0.96,1.0,I think we should just lean in.
34498,PS2,3,1170.24,1170.52,0.28,1.0,Why not?
34498,PS2,3,1171.28,1172.0,0.72,2.0,It's a solution.
34498,PS2,3,1172.0,1173.08,1.08,1.0,"You know, I guess a."
34498,PS2,3,1174.12,1174.4,0.28,2.0,Solution.
34498,PS2,3,1174.4,1177.24,2.84,2.0,"Not saying it's an amazing one, but it could work OK."
34498,PS2,3,1178.16,1182.44,4.28,1.0,So vulnerabilities within a supply chain could lead to unpredictable costs and inefficient delivery.
34498,PS2,3,1182.44,1182.68,0.24,3.0,Schedule.
34498,PS2,3,1182.68,1188.92,6.24,3.0,"Maybe we should say something like time travelling, like, oh, oh, there's sense."
34498,PS2,3,1189.44,1193.32,3.88,2.0,"Once it's happened, we can let's travel backwards and stop it from happening."
34498,PS2,3,1194.72,1195.56,0.84,2.0,It's always efficient.
34498,PS2,3,1195.56,1198.0,2.44,1.0,How do we deploy the time travelling technology?
34498,PS2,3,1199.28,1203.44,4.16,1.0,Like do the ship it's like at the shipping ports or it's at the train stations?
34498,PS2,3,1203.44,1208.56,5.12,3.0,"No, just the person like the person who like who responsible for this?"
34498,PS2,3,1208.76,1210.4,1.64,3.0,Just trans but who's?
34498,PS2,3,1210.88,1214.16,3.28,1.0,Responsible because there's many people responsible in the value chain.
34498,PS2,3,1214.32,1215.36,1.04,1.0,"Like if you're sending it, are you?"
34498,PS2,3,1215.36,1217.6,2.24,3.0,"Like the planning, the the the planning."
34498,PS2,3,1217.96,1218.92,0.96,1.0,So like DHL would?
34498,PS2,3,1218.92,1219.24,0.32,1.0,"Yeah, but."
34498,PS2,3,1219.24,1231.28,12.04,2.0,"What if everyone has the time travelling with like watch they are government issued at, you know, at their birth, coded to you so they can know what's, you know, if you've gone and done fishy business."
34498,PS2,3,1233.12,1243.56,10.44,2.0,"Because then, you know, if these people go working logistics somewhere, they would be able to fix any mistake they see themselves, therefore creating a perfectly efficient thing because no one's making mistakes."
34498,PS2,3,1243.56,1243.96,0.4,2.0,Yeah.
34498,PS2,3,1245.36,1247.56,2.2,1.0,"I like that, but I don't think it should be everyone."
34498,PS2,3,1247.56,1252.0,4.44,1.0,"I think it should be people in the shipping industry because like, why would I as a person?"
34498,PS2,3,1252.2,1255.68,3.48,3.0,Would it also be like the the one who like the supplier?
34498,PS2,3,1256.52,1258.36,1.84,1.0,"Right, the shipping supplier."
34498,PS2,3,1259.4,1263.4,4.0,3.0,"Not the actual raw material supplier, because that."
34498,PS2,3,1263.96,1268.56,4.6,2.0,"You know, like what happens if there's a hurricane and then, you know, it sinks all ships you have."
34498,PS2,3,1268.56,1268.96,0.4,3.0,Travel.
34498,PS2,3,1268.96,1270.36,1.4,1.0,"Back, yeah, Try and travel back, yeah."
34498,PS2,3,1270.52,1274.96,4.44,2.0,"But then the demand still exists and people are going to be like, I still want that thing."
34498,PS2,3,1275.6,1278.0,2.4,1.0,But then you can plan either send more before.
34498,PS2,3,1278.04,1278.44,0.4,3.0,Or I think.
34498,PS2,3,1280.04,1281.48,1.44,2.0,"Come further back, yeah."
34498,PS2,3,1282.84,1283.24,0.4,1.0,But I still.
34498,PS2,3,1283.24,1286.8,3.56,2.0,Think that demand then still exists if you've satiated the supplier back then?
34498,PS2,3,1288.28,1291.88,3.6,1.0,"Theoretically, you would get a completely demand supply matched economy, right?"
34498,PS2,3,1291.88,1292.12,0.24,1.0,Because.
34498,PS2,3,1292.12,1293.88,1.76,2.0,The most efficient allocation of.
34498,PS2,3,1293.88,1295.16,1.28,1.0,Resource allocation efficiency.
34498,PS2,3,1296.6,1299.0,2.4,1.0,"No, there's no asymmetric or anything."
34498,PS2,3,1299.16,1299.96,0.8,2.0,Never again.
34498,PS2,3,1301.28,1307.08,5.8,1.0,"But I still think like the people, the shipping people should have those devices because as a private person, that's."
34498,PS2,3,1307.12,1309.56,2.44,2.0,Just everyone got to the shipping industry.
34498,PS2,3,1310.32,1314.12,3.8,3.0,"Yeah, but I think why not just the shipping industry?"
34498,PS2,3,1314.32,1314.68,0.36,1.0,Why not?
34498,PS2,3,1314.68,1317.88,3.2,1.0,"Yeah, like FedEx could have like time travelling FedEx."
34498,PS2,3,1318.0,1318.84,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, but why?"
34498,PS2,3,1318.88,1319.64,0.76,3.0,What's to stop?
34498,PS2,3,1320.08,1324.84,4.76,2.0,"FedEx, why is not going altering the world and being like, you know, the one government solution to it?"
34498,PS2,3,1324.84,1326.32,1.48,1.0,Regulation we have to carry.
34498,PS2,3,1326.32,1327.96,1.64,3.0,"No, we don't have to regulate this thing."
34498,PS2,3,1328.16,1328.68,0.52,2.0,Regulation.
34498,PS2,3,1328.68,1329.44,0.76,2.0,They can just go back.
34498,PS2,3,1329.44,1330.72,1.28,1.0,Into the regulation and we have.
34498,PS2,3,1330.76,1332.08,1.32,2.0,To tell the guy who's going to go to.
34498,PS2,3,1332.08,1332.64,0.56,1.0,Regulation.
34498,PS2,3,1332.76,1335.84,3.08,1.0,But how do we know that there won't be a butterfly effect on this in general?
34498,PS2,3,1335.84,1339.0,3.16,1.0,"Like, OK, that you missed the hurricane, but then this person."
34498,PS2,3,1339.2,1339.64,0.44,3.0,"It's OK, we."
34498,PS2,3,1340.2,1340.64,0.44,1.0,Can't just keep.
34498,PS2,3,1340.64,1341.48,0.84,1.0,We're not worried about it.
34498,PS2,3,1341.68,1343.04,1.36,3.0,"OK, we can't just keep turning."
34498,PS2,3,1343.36,1344.04,0.68,2.0,Back in time.
34498,PS2,3,1344.04,1346.16,2.12,2.0,We're eventually going to go back and there's going to be no humans.
34498,PS2,3,1347.68,1349.16,1.48,1.0,"Well, that would be efficient."
34498,PS2,3,1349.16,1351.12,1.96,2.0,But then there is a human because he's travelled back it.
34498,PS2,3,1352.48,1353.64,1.16,1.0,Just gets launched by a dinosaur.
34498,PS2,3,1353.76,1355.2,1.44,1.0,Humanity cease to exist.
34498,PS2,3,1357.44,1358.6,1.16,1.0,"OK, but how do we?"
34498,PS2,3,1359.08,1360.2,1.12,1.0,What's our thesis here?
34498,PS2,3,1361.56,1365.12,3.56,3.0,Like the time time travelling ability will fix.
34498,PS2,3,1365.64,1365.84,0.2,1.0,This.
34498,PS2,3,1365.84,1367.72,1.88,3.0,Issue but OK the mechanic.
34498,PS2,3,1367.72,1368.44,0.72,3.0,So why?
34498,PS2,3,1368.44,1370.16,1.72,2.0,Don't we just invent teleportation?
34498,PS2,3,1370.16,1372.28,2.12,1.0,But everyone on Earth gets the watch.
34498,PS2,3,1372.92,1375.76,2.84,1.0,"That's what we're saying, Yeah, it feels like."
34498,PS2,3,1377.0,1378.4,1.4,3.0,"Oh yeah, that's."
34498,PS2,3,1378.4,1380.48,2.08,2.0,"That's why it's DNA encoded, because it is."
34498,PS2,3,1382.0,1382.28,0.28,1.0,Enabled.
34498,PS2,3,1382.36,1382.96,0.6,1.0,I see.
34498,PS2,3,1386.04,1388.08,2.04,2.0,"OK, but then who controls the authenesses?"
34498,PS2,3,1388.36,1392.28,3.92,2.0,This is becoming dangerously close to authoritarian.
34498,PS2,3,1394.44,1395.76,1.32,1.0,"Yeah, it's pretty bad already."
34498,PS2,3,1396.4,1400.24,3.84,2.0,Entrusted to an AR and they're randomly assigned who gets an.
34498,PS2,3,1400.68,1401.24,0.56,1.0,Automatic.
34498,PS2,3,1401.24,1401.8,0.56,1.0,No.
34498,PS2,3,1402.4,1408.84,6.44,1.0,We're trying to get away from ChatGPT that allows some users.
34498,PS2,3,1410.04,1410.32,0.28,3.0,No.
34498,PS2,3,1410.32,1413.0,2.68,3.0,"Allow all users, allow everyone."
34498,PS2,3,1413.0,1416.36,3.36,2.0,It's going to travel back and be like I'm on a holiday in this era for a bit.
34498,PS2,3,1419.16,1419.56,0.4,1.0,OK.
34498,PS2,3,1424.24,1426.76,2.52,3.0,"Maybe we can say like it's going to be, it's going to be expensive."
34498,PS2,3,1426.76,1428.24,1.48,3.0,"So like, not everyone will."
34498,PS2,3,1429.36,1434.92,5.56,1.0,It says uncontrolled costs and I feel like we're solving for inefficiency but not uncontrolled costs.
34498,PS2,3,1435.28,1437.8,2.52,2.0,If everyone's free issued and it doesn't cost them anything.
34498,PS2,3,1437.8,1442.72,4.92,1.0,"OK, so it's free, it gets A and it's coming from the government free, so."
34498,PS2,3,1442.72,1443.44,0.72,2.0,It's always for free.
34498,PS2,3,1443.44,1444.16,0.72,2.0,It's from the government.
34498,PS2,3,1444.16,1447.08,2.92,2.0,No one pays.
34498,PS2,3,1453.08,1455.28,2.2,1.0,So time travel this means.
34498,PS2,3,1456.32,1462.12,5.8,2.0,"It gets activated at the moment you deliver the first thing to someone, you give them a cup of coffee and then you go back."
34498,PS2,3,1462.48,1463.0,0.52,2.0,Come on there.
34498,PS2,3,1463.0,1463.8,0.8,2.0,Just bring in this room.
34498,PS2,3,1467.44,1468.16,0.72,3.0,"Josh, you'll like it so."
34498,PS2,3,1468.64,1471.6,2.96,1.0,I'm really I'm having trouble constructing this story.
34498,PS2,3,1471.6,1483.44,11.84,1.0,This is a less linear story than the last one because everyone on Earth gets a free DNA encoded watch from the government that allows users to time travel supply chain.
34498,PS2,3,1483.68,1484.84,1.16,3.0,And there's yeah.
34498,PS2,3,1485.0,1488.72,3.72,1.0,There's any supply chain disruption?
34498,PS2,3,1495.36,1501.12,5.76,2.0,Uses interesting panel key.
34498,PS2,3,1507.56,1511.44,3.88,2.0,Interesting how they measure the how do you measure creativity?
34498,PS2,3,1511.44,1512.76,1.32,2.0,It's not a scale thing.
34498,PS2,3,1513.28,1515.0,1.72,2.0,"It's not like, OK, well this is more creative."
34498,PS2,3,1515.0,1517.2,2.2,2.0,It's then subject to the person making the determination.
34498,PS2,3,1517.2,1518.16,0.96,1.0,Someone has a framework?
34498,PS2,3,1519.52,1520.04,0.52,1.0,Maybe we should ask.
34498,PS2,3,1520.08,1520.52,0.44,1.0,"Yeah, exactly."
34498,PS2,3,1526.56,1530.36,3.8,2.0,Get the word framework and I get excited to like sit down.
34498,PS2,3,1530.76,1535.84,5.08,1.0,"So if it's a perfectly efficient market, then costs are moot basically, right?"
34498,PS2,3,1537.52,1537.88,0.36,2.0,Yeah.
34498,PS2,3,1542.32,1547.48,5.16,2.0,"Well, nothing costs more than it should just to cover the transportation on that."
34498,PS2,3,1547.48,1557.96,10.48,2.0,So we should actually after.
34498,PS2,3,1557.96,1559.96,2.0,3.0,This we should actually ask JTPP.
34498,PS2,3,1561.16,1562.08,0.92,3.0,Like what their answer?
34498,PS2,3,1562.64,1571.24,8.6,2.0,"JTV is going to help with boring answers because it's going to draw on its database of information to try and solve this, and everyone's going to have logical answers."
34498,PS2,3,1572.12,1573.48,1.36,2.0,Got to think and logically.
34498,PS2,3,1574.84,1582.36,7.52,1.0,"OK, so everyone on earth gets free a free DNA encoded watch from the government that allows users to time travel."
34498,PS2,3,1582.36,1587.08,4.72,1.0,Any supply chain disruptions can be solved by going backwards in time and addressing the issue before it arises.
34498,PS2,3,1587.36,1592.6,5.24,1.0,"This will result in a perfectly efficient market, rendering costs moot as there's no real marginal gain or loss."
34498,PS2,3,1593.16,1595.96,2.8,1.0,Should say for for similar goods in the market.
34498,PS2,3,1596.48,1598.32,1.84,2.0,"Yeah, I think that's good, yeah."
34498,PS2,3,1601.72,1601.96,0.24,3.0,Oh.
35524,PS2,6,0.52,2.24,1.72,1.0,This is the questions when I do it.
35524,PS2,6,2.24,10.04,7.8,1.0,You from the abilities within the supply chain could lead to uncontrolled cost and inefficient delivery schedules.
35524,PS2,6,10.64,15.0,4.36,1.0,Please come up with one creative idea to tackle supply chain security.
35524,PS2,6,15.0,27.62,12.62,1.0,"Wow, supply chain security."
35524,PS2,6,28.7,40.4,11.7,2.0,"Maybe like for the inventory in the planes for example, we can like put in something like currently in the in the goods or stuff."
35524,PS2,6,40.4,50.12,9.72,2.0,"They put something in the planes and someone going outside with the goods they will break like alarm or something, but it's like the normal 1."
35524,PS2,6,50.24,53.08,2.84,2.0,So we should looking for the creative thing.
35524,PS2,6,58.0,59.4,1.4,1.0,But it's kind of weird because.
35524,PS2,6,64.72,67.12,2.4,2.0,We can only like come up with one creative.
35524,PS2,6,67.24,67.56,0.32,1.0,Idea.
35524,PS2,6,67.68,68.04,0.36,1.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,68.04,69.04,1.0,1.0,We just have to come up with one.
35524,PS2,6,74.44,75.28,0.84,3.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,75.28,79.88,4.6,3.0,"So, so you just talk about having alerts to about, about the supply."
35524,PS2,6,80.88,81.16,0.28,3.0,Yeah.
35524,PS2,6,81.16,96.76,15.6,3.0,"I'm just thinking probably from another perspective, if we are low on supply for one of the products, probably we can do some campaign to direct the customers to some other products that we are high in stock."
35524,PS2,6,97.08,97.68,0.6,1.0,"Oh, OK."
35524,PS2,6,98.4,100.12,1.72,3.0,"In supply, is that something?"
35524,PS2,6,100.96,102.96,2.0,4.0,"But I think it's it's, but I think it's more substitute."
35524,PS2,6,103.76,104.12,0.36,1.0,Substitute.
35524,PS2,6,104.36,104.68,0.32,2.0,Products.
35524,PS2,6,105.2,110.16,4.96,1.0,"But I'm I'm, I'm, I'm kind of blurred about the questions because it's talking about security."
35524,PS2,6,110.44,110.56,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
35524,PS2,6,110.88,115.12,4.24,1.0,Like please come up with one kind of idea to tackle supply chain security like.
35524,PS2,6,116.68,121.96,5.28,2.0,"Because something goods will be missing on the delivery process, so we should minimize that."
35524,PS2,6,122.24,123.64,1.4,4.0,"Yeah, I think, I think that kind of things, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,127.68,128.6,0.92,2.0,Put the creative idea.
35524,PS2,6,129.72,130.04,0.32,4.0,I'll just.
35524,PS2,6,130.04,130.68,0.64,1.0,Put the bomb in it.
35524,PS2,6,131.36,132.2,0.84,4.0,"Like, have you watched?"
35524,PS2,6,132.24,134.2,1.96,1.0,"Mission Impossible, like every time."
35524,PS2,6,135.48,136.2,0.72,4.0,He uses.
35524,PS2,6,137.16,139.0,1.84,1.0,Like a phone for mission and.
35524,PS2,6,139.0,139.8,0.8,4.0,Then he just like.
35524,PS2,6,140.52,142.12,1.6,1.0,"Poof, like so."
35524,PS2,6,142.16,142.6,0.44,4.0,Every time.
35524,PS2,6,142.6,147.76,5.16,1.0,"Someone steals it, it's like a yeah, So no one will want to steal it anyway because it will have their value for them."
35524,PS2,6,147.8,151.4,3.6,1.0,"When we like, just push a button and then it goes off."
35524,PS2,6,153.92,154.36,0.44,1.0,But I don't know.
35524,PS2,6,154.36,155.92,1.56,1.0,"That's just yeah, Yeah, I think yeah, something."
35524,PS2,6,159.6,161.24,1.64,4.0,Like that but if you guys have different ideas please.
35524,PS2,6,161.64,162.0,0.36,1.0,Please come.
35524,PS2,6,167.12,170.08,2.96,3.0,"Yeah, I'm just thinking for supply chain security here."
35524,PS2,6,170.08,170.52,0.44,3.0,I think.
35524,PS2,6,172.16,180.4,8.24,3.0,"I, I think what they mean here is about like uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery schedules."
35524,PS2,6,180.4,194.36,13.96,3.0,"So it's more like the cost might fluctuate, so you might get an increase in cost and you can't increase the price, so you get less profit or inefficient delivery schedule."
35524,PS2,6,194.36,197.28,2.92,3.0,So you don't get that live delivery on time.
35524,PS2,6,197.72,205.4,7.68,3.0,"If the supply is low, the stock is low, and you don't have enough in stock for your customer to yeah."
35524,PS2,6,206.16,206.8,0.64,4.0,"Yeah, yeah, I."
35524,PS2,6,207.32,208.32,1.0,3.0,Think that's.
35524,PS2,6,209.08,209.88,0.8,1.0,"Yeah, that's all that makes."
35524,PS2,6,209.88,210.04,0.16,4.0,Sense.
35524,PS2,6,220.68,228.48,7.8,5.0,"I mean, you can come up with like specific companies that focus on specific goods so that doesn't get mixed up."
35524,PS2,6,229.08,237.64,8.56,5.0,"Like for example, maybe smaller items can be with this company and then like larger, but then doesn't help with the costs so."
35524,PS2,6,239.76,242.8,3.04,3.0,You have like a a range of suppliers to choose.
35524,PS2,6,243.04,244.6,1.56,5.0,"From yeah, yeah, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,244.72,248.88,4.16,3.0,In case one slower supply or increase in price.
35524,PS2,6,253.24,255.28,2.04,5.0,But I like the first idea about tracking devices.
35524,PS2,6,255.36,256.36,1.0,5.0,I think that's a good idea.
35524,PS2,6,257.12,265.96,8.84,2.0,"Yeah, maybe tracking and something come up and at least something come up we can change with creative ideas like bubbles or something."
35524,PS2,6,265.96,274.04,8.08,2.0,Just creative by our music instead of alarms.
35524,PS2,6,274.36,275.08,0.72,1.0,For example.
35524,PS2,6,276.48,283.56,7.08,2.0,"And then it's connected to our device or the customers the the security or guard, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,288.76,291.16,2.4,3.0,"Sure, yeah, probably you can just write like."
35524,PS2,6,291.4,291.6,0.2,1.0,1st.
35524,PS2,6,291.76,292.0,0.24,2.0,Write.
35524,PS2,6,292.04,294.2,2.16,2.0,So it's OK.
35524,PS2,6,294.2,294.64,0.44,2.0,"Yeah, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,294.68,295.68,1.0,3.0,"We can, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,308.0,309.16,1.16,2.0,Ensuring.
35524,PS2,6,338.36,341.76,3.4,3.0,So are we now kind of building on this idea?
35524,PS2,6,349.04,353.96,4.92,3.0,What does it say about that about tracking goods during the supply in supply chain?
35524,PS2,6,354.12,362.96,8.84,6.0,How does tracking solve the problem of uncontrolled costs and inefficient delivery?
35524,PS2,6,363.84,366.12,2.28,6.0,Like we're not losing products now.
35524,PS2,6,366.12,369.36,3.24,6.0,We're like they're not delivered on time and.
35524,PS2,6,369.36,369.76,0.4,2.0,"Also, yeah."
35524,PS2,6,369.76,369.88,0.12,3.0,Yeah.
35524,PS2,6,371.6,372.28,0.68,6.0,The cost?
35524,PS2,6,375.6,378.48,2.88,1.0,But we have to define vulnerabilities within the supply chain.
35524,PS2,6,378.88,379.12,0.24,4.0,What?
35524,PS2,6,379.12,379.56,0.44,4.0,What does that?
35524,PS2,6,379.6,380.32,0.72,1.0,Mean what?
35524,PS2,6,380.48,382.8,2.32,1.0,What do you mean by vulnerable like that?
35524,PS2,6,382.8,383.84,1.04,1.0,"That's the main reason, right?"
35524,PS2,6,384.32,386.76,2.44,1.0,"Because at the end, they'll talk about security as well."
35524,PS2,6,387.56,387.84,0.28,4.0,You have to.
35524,PS2,6,387.84,397.28,9.44,1.0,"Define that first if vulnerabilities like meaning you know the goods can be let's say broken, which means you have unfundable cost because you have to make."
35524,PS2,6,397.28,397.32,0.04,4.0,A.
35524,PS2,6,397.32,397.36,0.04,4.0,A.
35524,PS2,6,397.6,403.56,5.96,1.0,New one or in the delivery you have like an accident or something like that.
35524,PS2,6,404.32,408.12,3.8,1.0,The delivery display chain that makes it not on time.
35524,PS2,6,409.2,410.68,1.48,1.0,"So, yeah, it's, it's a broad."
35524,PS2,6,411.52,412.24,0.72,1.0,"Yeah, it's a."
35524,PS2,6,412.24,412.44,0.2,4.0,Broad.
35524,PS2,6,412.68,417.04,4.36,5.0,"I mean, sometimes even the post office doesn't, they can't, can't find like particular items."
35524,PS2,6,417.04,419.36,2.32,5.0,So it takes a lot of time to return it.
35524,PS2,6,419.36,421.12,1.76,5.0,"And yeah, maybe like that's."
35524,PS2,6,421.68,422.52,0.84,1.0,Things like that also.
35524,PS2,6,422.72,423.16,0.44,4.0,Contest.
35524,PS2,6,423.16,423.28,0.12,4.0,Yeah.
35524,PS2,6,424.0,425.4,1.4,2.0,"Cost for refund, Yeah."
